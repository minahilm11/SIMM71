https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/07/israel-and-palestine-how-peace-is-possible,"IF YOU WANT to understand how desperately Israelis and Palestinians need peace, consider what would become of them in a state of perpetual war. Against a vastly superior Israeli army, the Palestinians’ most powerful weapon would remain the death and suffering of their own people. Israel’s fate would be woeful, too, if it wants to be a flourishing, modern democracy. If Israel permanently relies on its army to subjugate the Palestinians, it would become an apartheid-enforcing pariah. Israelis carrying out daily acts of oppression punctuated by rounds of killing would themselves be corrupted. For two peoples locked in a violent embrace, peace is the only deliverance. But how to get there? Israelis are still reeling from the rape and murder of October 7th; Palestinians are watching the mangled bodies of women and children pile up in Gaza. Amid the carnage, outsiders’ urging of peace seems naive. Besides, jaded Palestinians and Israelis see endless talks as a mechanism for delaying peace, not forging it. Negotiators in the past have thrashed out almost every imaginable permutation of land swaps and security arrangements. All failed. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas And yet something changed after October 7th. Israel’s strategy of marginalising the Palestinians and their dreams is broken. Both sides have a chance to find new leaders with a new vision. And after years of neglect, outsiders may be ready to help, crucially including a group of Arab countries. They must not fall into the trap of thinking that peace requires sweating the detail yet again. Success depends on the two sides wanting peace and—much harder—believing in it. If the fighting is to make any sense it must lead to peace, which means two nations living side by side. Israel’s bombardment has killed over 16,000 Palestinians, including Hamas fighters. Although some Palestinians have been radicalised by that and the daily humiliations of occupation, many detest Hamas and its unwinnable wars and would live with Israel if they could prosper. So long as the men with guns do not get in their way, those people will seek peace. Israel, too, needs a new strategy. The old one failed to fulfil the state’s basic promise to create a land safe for Jews; 1,400 people were killed or kidnapped by Hamas, hundreds of thousands more have been evacuated. Peace also requires new leaders, because the present ones are discredited. In Israel Binyamin Netanyahu is an obstacle to a genuine reconciliation, the sooner he goes the better. America could usefully signal that it expects Israel to hold elections soon. Polls suggest that he will be replaced by Benny Gantz, a former general who understands the toll of war. Mr Gantz has not endorsed a Palestinian state, but neither has he ruled one out. New Palestinian leadership is needed, too. Hamas is an avowed enemy of peace: for as long as it runs Gaza, Palestinian pledges to embrace peace will not be believable. On the West Bank, Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian Authority (PA), is corrupt, ossified and lacks any democratic legitimacy. Amid the rubble of war, Gaza will need time to rebuild and re-establish some kind of stable administration. Moderate Arab countries should sponsor a transitional Palestinian leadership for the West Bank and Gaza that can begin building trust among its own people and, vitally, with the Israelis, before holding elections. By running both Gaza and the West Bank, it would become a more credible partner for peace. That leads to the process. The Oslo accords, marked in 1993 with a wary handshake on the White House lawn, left the hardest details until last. Every inch of progress had to be wrung out of the two sides. This sapped belief that success was possible. A new process must make early progress. Both sides will have to take on their own extremists, who would sabotage coexistence. The PA must shut down armed groups, foil terrorists and tackle corruption. Boosting the economy demands numerous agreements with Israel over trade, utilities and work permits. Palestinians need to know they are gaining freedoms and rights. Land swaps can wait, but Israel should deal with the settlements too deep in the West Bank ever to be part of Israel. It must start policing them and stop them from expanding further. It needs to be clear that the 100,000 or so settlers who live in them will eventually have to move or come under Palestinian rule. This is too hard for the Israelis and Palestinians to do on their own, so the outside world must be involved. Under Oslo, America was the sponsor, but it struggled to exert pressure on Israel, which can muster formidable support in Congress. This time, the Arab world should play a decisive role. Under the Abraham accords, negotiated during the Trump administration, several countries recognised Israel. That was part of a vision for the Middle East based around trade and prosperity rather than ideology. Their money will be required to rebuild Gaza. Their soldiers can help provide security when Israel leaves the strip, which should happen as early as possible. If they work together, they can starve Hamas of money and shelter, diverting funds to reconstruction instead. Their heft can give a transitional Palestinian leader diplomatic cover while he establishes himself and his administration. The key is early pressure exerted by America and Saudi Arabia on Israel and the Palestinians. The PA argues that peace could be kick-started if America and the European Union sent Israel a signal by recognising a Palestinian state upfront—an idea endorsed by Spain, which holds the EU presidency. America should fulfil its promise to open a diplomatic mission for the Palestinians in Jerusalem. But full recognition of Palestine by the West and of Israel by Saudi Arabia should be held out as rewards for the future, as an incentive for progress. Time for that is short. Israel’s anti-Palestinian right will remain strong. Once this government falls, the next may have only a single term to rekindle Israelis’ faith that peace is possible. In the PA a new leader will face enemies who got fat under today’s rotten system. Whatever remains of Hamas will seek to wreck peace, as will Iran and its proxies, who thrive on chaos and strife. The Biden administration may be willing to press Israel; a Trump administration might not. If permanent war is not to ruin two nations, Israelis, Palestinians and all who cherish them must seize the moment. ■ For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/international/2023/11/02/israel-is-more-popular-than-social-media-posts-suggest,"If you scroll through a typical x (formerly Twitter) feed, it looks like sympathy for Israel following last month’s attacks has dried up. Supporters of the Palestinians have taken not just to the streets but also to their keyboards. “At first I was angry at Hamas and Palestine for the attacks” wrote one user,  “but now after seeing more of what’s going on I cannot support such a regime in Israel. #FreePalestine”. Do such views reflect overall opinion? At our request dmr, an ai-technology firm, collected 1m posts from Instagram, Twitter and YouTube from October 7th to 23rd. All contained hashtags from a list with similar numbers of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian terms in English, or replied to such posts. dmr then built a machine-learning model to classify posts as backing one side, the other or neither. It was trained on content in English, but also processed posts in any language that included English hashtags. dmr found a sharp shift against Israel over time. On October 7th the two sides had roughly equal shares of support. By October 19th pro-Palestinian posts were 3.9 times more common than pro-Israeli ones. Israel has fared far worse online than in surveys of overall public opinion. A poll of Americans by YouGov found three backers of Israel for every Palestinian supporter on October 20th—a day with twice as many pro-Palestinian posts on American social media as pro-Israeli ones. In Britain, another YouGov survey found equal support for each side that day, when the Palestinians won the British social-media battle by a six-to-one margin. One cause of this gap is age. Social-media users skew young, and such people are unusually pro-Palestinian in their views. Moreover, DMR’s sample did not include Facebook, which may be the most pro-Israel platform owing to its older users. In polls of people in Denmark, France, Spain and Sweden, Israel drew more total sympathy, but young participants’ opinions matched social-media ratios. Yet in America and Britain, social-media views are even more pro-Palestinian than those of young poll respondents. Israel’s backers show rather less zeal for online combat. ■"
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/18/a-short-history-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict,"Visit our dedicated hub for coverage of Israel and Hamas. HOW HAVE Israel’s borders changed over time? And why did Palestinian autonomous territories end up scattered in two separate regions? The shifting lines on the map help to explain more than a century of conflict between Arabs and Jews in the Holy Land. Our explanation begins in 1916 (see map 1). During the first world war Sir Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, and François Georges-Picot, a French one, were appointed by their governments to secretly divvy up the lands of the Ottoman empire. The Arab provinces were to be split up among European powers. Palestine was envisioned as international territory given its significance in Christianity, Islam and Judaism. In 1917 Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, stating its support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”. By then Jewish agricultural settlement in Palestine had already begun, and the Zionist movement, founded by Theodor Herzl, had declared its aim to create a Jewish homeland at its first congress in Basel in 1897. The San Remo Conference of 1920 finalised the partition of the Ottoman empire.  Britain was given a mandate to rule parts of the international territory envisioned under Sykes-Picot. This was split again the following year into Palestine and Transjordan, an Arab kingdom under Hashemite rule. The mandate was approved by the League of Nations, a forerunner to the United Nations, in 1922. Importantly, it included support for the Balfour Declaration. Arabs living there turned increasingly to violence against their occupiers and growing numbers of Jewish migrants, including German Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1936 the Arabs revolted. The British crushed the uprising, but tried to win over the Arabs by restricting Jewish ambitions in the region. Jewish militant groups began launching their own revolt which spread after the second world war. Eventually the British gave up and handed the problem over to the UN. After the Holocaust, pressure grew for the international recognition of a Jewish state. In 1947 the UN proposed the partition of Palestine into three parts: an Arab state, a Jewish state and Jerusalem, which was intended to be a corpus separatum, or a separate, internationally run entity. Violence only worsened. As Britain completed its withdrawal in 1948 Jewish leaders declared the establishment of the state of Israel. Neighbouring Arab countries promptly invaded. Israel survived the Arab invasion. In the Armistice of 1949 a demarcation line (known as the “Green Line”) served as the de facto borders between Israel and Arab states, though the Arab governments refused to recognise Israel. More than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were pushed out of their homes. They called this the nakba, the catastrophe. The Gaza Strip and the West Bank came under the control of Egypt and Transjordan (later Jordan), respectively. Jerusalem was divided. In 1967, during the six-day war between Israel and its Arab neighbours, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai peninsula. It annexed East Jerusalem, along with a slice of the West Bank, and moved to build Jewish settlements in the occupied lands. In October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria launched an attack in Sinai and the Golan Heights. Under American auspices, Israel and Egypt signed the Camp David accords in 1978 and a peace treaty the following year. Israel agreed to give back all of Sinai, and to grant Palestinians autonomy. Outraged Arab countries kicked Egypt out of the Arab league, and there was no progress on Palestinian autonomy. In 1987 Palestinians rose up, in what became known as the first intifada, a sustained movement of strikes and stone-throwing protests. In 1993 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation signed the first Oslo accord, which set out a five-year period of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under a new entity, the Palestinian Authority (PA). The interim arrangements created a messy patchwork in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip: in Area A the PA was given full civil and security control; in Area B it had civil-affairs and some law-and-order powers, but Israel retained ultimate security control; and in Area C Israel kept full control. The accord left the final status of Jerusalem and settlements to be sorted out later. During the second intifada, which lasted from 2000 to 2005 and involved the use of guns and suicide bombs by Palestinians, Israel built a security barrier in the West Bank and eventually withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip. In the West Bank it pulled out of four settlements. Today almost 3m Palestinians live in the West Bank, as well as more than 450,000 Israelis living in settlements (excluding East Jerusalem), a figure that has grown roughly fourfold since the Oslo accords were signed. Some settlers have now lived in the West Bank for two generations. Jerusalem is ringed with settlements. Palestinians in Gaza fare considerably worse than those elsewhere. The region has been controlled by Hamas, a militant group, since 2007. After it came to power, Egypt and Israel tightened a stifling blockade on the territory. Hamas militants and Israel have now been at war five times. The latest fighting has been the deadliest yet.■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/05/13/a-kingdom-of-two-halves,"WESTERN powers have long found money a good way of persuading the Hashemites, who rule Jordan, to do their bidding. A century ago, T.E. Lawrence, a charismatic British officer, persuaded them to rebel against the rule of the Ottoman Turks by letting them loot the trains they blew up. In more modern times, hefty dollops of aid have persuaded them to provide military facilities for the Americans in their war in Iraq and to accommodate the region’s periodic splurges of refugees, most recently from Syria. Surely, Western officials say, for the right price, currently estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, the Jordanians will help John Kerry, America’s secretary of state (pictured above with King Abdullah) to fix a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by absorbing the 4.5m Palestinians who live in the kingdom, including the 3.5m who are now Jordanian citizens. Or will they? Indigenous Bedouin from Jordan’s East Bank, who number about 3m, worry that America’s plans to persuade Palestinian leaders to strip generations of refugees of their claimed “right of return” to what is now Israel would reduce Jordan’s original inhabitants to a permanent minority. Tribal leaders fret that the refugees, barred from Israel, would campaign for full rights in Jordan, over time turning the kingdom into a second Palestinian state. The Bedouin would lose their preferential access to government jobs. They might also be deprived of the skewed electoral system that has hitherto ensured that they control Jordan’s parliament. “Kerry is destroying our home,” says a Jordanian analyst. “He is trying to solve one conflict by creating another.” Parliamentarians from Jordan’s East Bank (ie, non-Palestinians) intent on scuppering Mr Kerry’s plan say the Palestinians must uphold their right to return to Israel. Campaigners are denounced as American collaborators for calling for more rights for those 1m Palestinians resident in the kingdom who still do not have Jordanian nationality. When Mustafa Hamarneh, a Jordanian MP, suggested giving the children of Palestinian refugees access to Jordanian state education, health care and a driving licence, he was labelled a Zionist agent. Nervous lest they be accused of selling out, many of Jordan’s own Palestinians are also opposing Mr Kerry. After four generations in Jordan, most are unprepared to go anywhere else, but do not want to admit it. Many also fear that Jordan’s government may pocket any compensation supposedly earmarked for Palestinians to persuade them to drop their demand to get back their old homes in Israel. Jordanian officials suggest that Jordan should receive $500m for each of the 65 years they have hosted the refugees, while the country’s Palestinians suggest that each family should be compensated for the properties that Israelis took after 1948. The Palestinians in Jordan also argue that, far from being a burden, they have been responsible for building up Jordan’s economy. Jordan’s king may also have reason to flinch at Mr Kerry’s plans. Not only would a Palestinian state compete for some of the aid that now comes his way, but it might also steal the kingdom’s vaunted role as a buffer between Israel and a turbulent Arab world. If a Palestinian state were to emerge, replete with an American-backed force between Israel and the Jordan river, it could claim that role. The Jordanians are reluctant to lose it."
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-has-claimed-14000-lives-since-1987,"EIGHT DAYS have passed since the simmering conflict between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over once more. According to data from OCHA, a UN organisation, by May 17th it had claimed the lives of 230 people—mostly Palestinians but also nine Israelis and one Indian. The deaths of two Thai factory workers in Israel was announced on May 18th. The spark for the latest fighting came in Jerusalem, after Palestinians in the city objected to the erection of metal barriers near the Damascus gate of the old walled city—the main thoroughfare to the al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest place in Islam—during the month of Ramadan. As unrest escalated in Jerusalem, Hamas—a militant Islamist organisation that runs the impoverished enclave of Gaza—began to fire rockets into Israeli territory. Israel’s armed forces responded by bombarding Gaza. The fighting is reminiscent of three previous rounds of war. One difference this time is that violence has spread to Arabs and Jews in Israel’s mixed cities. America has repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council statements on the fighting, but on May 17th, in a call with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, President Joe Biden expressed support for a ceasefire. America is working with Egypt and other regional partners to secure one. It cannot come soon enough. The Palestinian dead include 96 women and children. With the exception of one soldier, all of the Israeli dead are civilians, too. The victims in this latest bout join a tragic toll from the decades-old conflict. According to data gathered by B’Tselem, an Israeli human-rights organisation, between December 9th 1987 and April 30th 2021, the conflict claimed 13,969 lives. Fully 87% of the dead were Palestinian. The recent violence brings the total to over 14,000. The bloodshed has come in different phases. The first Palestinian intifada, or “shaking off” of 1987 was a shock to Israel at the time and was the backdrop for the Oslo peace accords of 1994. They pointed the way to a two-state solution: the creation of a Palestinian state in territories occupied by Israel in 1967. But instead of peace came more violence. Extremists on both sides sought to destroy the compromise; Hamas and another radical faction, Islamic Jihad, in particular, embarked on a campaign of suicide-bombings; Israel responded with harsher security measures, including ever greater restrictions on the Gaza Strip. The failure of the Camp David talks in 2000 sparked the second, and far more violent intifada, which shifted from stone-throwing to the use of weapons, not least by the Palestinian Authority established under the Oslo accords, and more suicide-bombings. It prompted Israel to build a security barrier in the West Bank and to withdraw from Gaza in 2005. And since Hamas seized power in the enclave, there have been repeated rounds of fighting—the deadliest of which erupted in 2014. Settlement-building on occupied land has continued relentlessly. Latterly, though, the intensity of the conflict has diminished. The data from B’Tselem show that in the 15 years between the second intifada, which began in September 2000, and the end of the second Gaza war in August 2014, 800 people died each year, on average. Since then, victims have numbered 175 a year. In the same period, Israeli deaths fell from 85 a year to 14. Israel’s military might, its erection of security barriers and its deployment of anti-missile defences mean that, for most Israelis, most of the time, the conflict is out of sight and out of mind. Relations with Palestinians barely featured as an issue in the four elections Israel has held in the past two years. The international outcry over the plight of Palestinians is unlikely to change this mindset. The latest fighting may show how the unjust treatment of the Palestinians stores up trouble. But even now, the endless occupation seems tolerable to many Israelis who have lost faith in peace."
https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-a-reading-list,"Tensions in the Middle East are a political inheritance of the dissolution of the Ottoman empire after the first world war and the piecemeal settlements of 1922. This landmark book, published in 1989 and named as a finalist for the Pulitzer prize, provides a sweeping account of the period between 1914 and 1922, ranging from the Mediterranean to Afghanistan. It astutely traces the Allies’ motivations for carving up the Arab world and shows why the West’s imperial vision was doomed to fail. When, exactly, the Israel-Palestine conflict began is hard to say. Many consider November 2nd 1917 to be the starting-point: that is the date of the Balfour Declaration, when the British government vowed to use its “best endeavours” to create a “national home” for the Jewish people in Palestine, a territory it would take from the Ottomans. This balanced book, praised by Palestinian and Israeli historians alike, offers a tour of the past century of conflict. An eminent Palestinian-American historian explains why Palestinians failed to achieve an independent state. The book is resonant with personal history and lays out the barriers that obstructed Palestinians’ aspirations. It counts the poor decision-making of certain Palestinian leaders among its explanations, too. The militant organisation that rules the Gaza Strip first emerged in 1987 during the first Palestinian intifada (“shaking off”, or uprising). In its first charter Hamas styled itself as the “Islamic Resistance Movement” and declared Israel illegitimate. In 2006 Hamas became the first Islamist movement to ascend to power in the Middle East by winning an election. The authors interviewed hundreds of people over three decades, including the group’s leaders, fighters, opponents and victims. This book explains the inception of the “largest, most influential and most deadly Islamist organisation” and how it became entrenched in Gaza. The right first came to power in Israel nearly five decades ago, but its current government may be the most right-wing in the country’s 75-year history. This richly detailed book analyses with clarity and insight the political and philosophical ideas that drive the right. The author, who is a professor at Cambridge, studies important thinkers and figures such as Ze’ev Jabotinsky (the founder of the Zionist Right) and Binyamin Netanyahu (Israel’s prime minister). In 2000 the author, a British doctor, accompanied her husband, a UN official, and three small children to Israel. A month later the second Palestinian intifada erupted. This moving memoir—which spans three years—documents the events she witnessed. She gave birth to a fourth child in a hospital in Bethlehem, which was shelled by the Israeli army. A Palestinian suicide-bomber blew himself up near her children’s school, with his head landing at the foot of their teacher. The Economist’s journalists have also written books about the conflict. Anton La Guardia, our diplomatic editor, is the author of “Holy Land, Unholy War: Israelis and Palestinians”. Nicolas Pelham, a Middle East correspondent, wrote “Holy Lands: Reviving Pluralism in the Middle East”; Gregg Carlstrom, also a Middle East correspondent, wrote “How Long Will Israel Survive?: The Threat From Within”. Anshel Pfeffer, our Israel correspondent, is the author of “Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu”. ■ For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"
https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-aftermath-of-the-war-with-israel-will-shape-palestinian-life,"For more than a decade, life in the Palestinian territories was painfully static. The occupied West Bank was ruled by the corrupt nationalists of Fatah, and blockaded Gaza was run by the corrupt Islamists of Hamas. Residents of the West Bank endured the daily abuses of occupation. Those in Gaza suffered occasional short wars, and longer periods where life was calm but miserable. There was no progress towards a two-state solution—nor any reconciliation between the two estranged Palestinian factions. Everything changed in 2023. Even before October 7th, it was the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the West Bank. Then, on a quiet autumn morning, Hamas militants crossed the border into Israel and massacred more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Israel declared war immediately. Thousands of air strikes and, later, a ground invasion have laid waste to Gaza and killed more Palestinians than any war since 1948.  The coming year will reshape Palestinian life in a way unseen since 2007, when Hamas seized control of Gaza. How it will turn out is impossible to predict, but three important factors will do much to shape the outcome. The first is when, and under what circumstances, Israel will end its war in Gaza. The army says it will stop when it has removed Hamas from power. It will certainly hope to kill the group’s leaders. But Hamas has tens of thousands of militants and even more supporters.  Israel could find itself stuck in a long guerrilla war, and the residents of Gaza stuck in a long displacement. The second is what will follow the war. America and Israel hope the Gulf states will step in with money for reconstruction and, perhaps, troops for an international peacekeeping force. They would probably do the former; the latter is a harder sell. Arab leaders will, in turn, urge the Fatah-run Palestinian Authority (PA), which controls parts of the West Bank, to return to run Gaza. That is a best-case scenario. But the PA might not want to return to Gaza with the help of Israeli tanks.  And even if it did, it might find that it is unable to govern the territory (it has already lost control of bits of the West Bank). That would leave Israel in charge of security and basic services, perhaps with the help of a jerry-rigged government of local notables. Instead of reuniting the Palestinians, the war could reinforce their split. That points to a third question: the fate of the PA and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas. Half of Palestinians want to dissolve the PA, which they see as hopelessly corrupt, and 80% want Mr Abbas, who will soon start the 20th year of his four-year term, to resign. He is unlikely to listen, and he lacks a clear successor. Various apparatchiks hope to replace him, such as Majed Faraj, who heads the PA’s intelligence services, and Jibril Rajoub, a former security chief, but none is popular. Optimists hope that there might be a silver lining in a blood-soaked 2023: that the PA (flawed, corrupt but much more moderate than Hamas) could emerge strengthened, and a shocked Israel could re-commit itself to peace talks. But these days, optimism is in short supply. ■ Gregg Carlstrom, Middle East correspondent, The Economist, Dubai"
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/05/18/the-half-life-on-an-occupied-palestine,"ISRAEL, THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY and Hamas may be bitter rivals, but they all agree on one thing: the Erez border crossing between Gaza and Israel, for the lucky few allowed to use it, is a prime opportunity to recruit spies. At the Israeli terminal a poster showing a handshake offers the “Chance of Your Lifetime” to Palestinians willing to provide information on militants. Beyond a buffer zone, at the PA and Hamas posts, murals warn Palestinians against betraying the homeland. Erez marks one of the world’s strangest frontiers, separating the lush fields of Israeli kibbutzim from the free-fire zones, rubble and chaos of Gaza—a territory that is neither a state, nor an autonomous domain of the PA, nor even a fully occupied territory after Israel pulled out in 2005. Instead it is a large detention camp, guarded from without by Israeli forces (and by Egyptian troops), and from within by Hamas, the strongest of the armed gangs, which pushed out the PA in 2007. The PA’s border post provides a convenient buffer between Israel and Hamas. The façade of the Israeli terminal masks a surreal automated facility. No Israeli is in sight as Palestinians emerging from Gaza make their way through remote-controlled gates and scanners. Commands are barked through distorted tannoys, or made with obscure hand signals from behind the blast-proof window of a control room high above. Since the Israelis left, Israel and Hamas have engaged in four major rounds of fighting and endless smaller clashes. Everybody expects another war, though few seem to want it. The Shujaiya neighbourhood, pounded to rubble in 2014, is being rebuilt with scarce materials from charitable donations or, for those who can afford it, the black market. The liveliest bit of Gaza’s economy is the recycling of war rubble. Electricity is intermittent, and clean water is in short supply. Majed al-Heisso, a father of six, makes a living from occasional but dangerous work tilling fields nearby. In the game of Gazan roulette, those recognised by Israeli spotters as regular farmers are allowed to work land close to Israel’s buffer zone; others risk being shot. Hamas is keeping a ceasefire, but struggles to stop smaller Salafist factions from using places like Shujaiya to launch rockets at Israel. Residents flee to escape Israeli retaliatory fire. “There is firing every day. I want it to end. We don’t want any more wars. The children have nightmares every day,” says Mr Heisso. “The militants fire rockets, get paid and have happy lives. We are the victims.” There is growing talk in Israel of relieving the economic siege of Gaza, including proposals to build a port on an offshore island (controlled by Israel). One reason is to avoid a return to war. Another is ideological: by treating Gaza as if it were a Palestinian state, Israeli right-wingers think they might more easily fend off pressure for territorial concessions in the West Bank. This all feeds Hamas’s conviction that violence is the only language that Israel understands. “Gaza was liberated by resistance,” says Mahmoud Zahhar, a senior Hamas political figure who has lost two sons in the fighting and whose house has been bombed four times. By contrast, he says, the Palestinian Authority’s security co-operation with Israel in the West Bank has led only to the expansion of settlements. Yet Hamas, too, is under pressure. On May 1st it issued a new policy paper that updates, but does not abolish, its founding charter of 1988. It drops the crudest anti-Semitic passages and accepts the creation of a Palestinian state in just the West Bank and Gaza as a “formula of national consensus”. Yet Hamas is no convert to a two-state solution; it remains committed to the “full and complete liberation of Palestine”, if necessary by “resistance and jihad”. Its vision of a Palestinian state is maximalist and, like Gaza, in permanent conflict with Israel. For Mr Zahhar, “Israel is a foreign body,” although Hamas could talk to it about humanitarian issues: bird flu, say, or the exchange of prisoners. For Israel, the document is a non-starter. By distancing Hamas from the Muslim Brotherhood, it signals accommodation with Egypt, which has eased the closure of the Rafah crossing. And it seeks to appeal to militant factions of Fatah as the Palestinian Authority squeezes Gaza, cutting salaries to Palestinian civil servants and throttling subsidies for fuel and electricity. The timing matters: it came as the Hamas politburo named a new leader, Ismail Haniyah, the former head of Hamas in Gaza; and as Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, prepares for a possible resumption of peace talks with Israel (see article). In his capital of Ramallah in the West Bank, Mr Abbas, who is 82, is treated with indifference by Israel and contempt by many Palestinians. Life in Ramallah may be easier than in Gaza, but corruption in the PA rankles, as does the erosion of democracy. Mr Abbas is in the 13th year of his four-year term. Potential rivals are circling. Mr Abbas’s lieutenants think a two-state deal is still feasible. “We are in the last 15 minutes,” declares Jibril Rajoub, a former head of internal security in the West Bank (now head of the Palestinian Olympic Committee) and a potential a successor. The world is “fed up” with Israel’s occupation, he says, and Donald Trump may provide an unexpected breakthrough. “He said America first, not Israel first.” Such claims are met with guffaws on the streets. “A Palestinian state? That’s just a movie. Things were much better before the Palestinian Authority came here,” says Khalil Abu Ibrahim, a fruit-and-vegetable seller who has set up in a prime spot: next to the captive clientele of the gridlocked roundabout at Kalandia checkpoint, in the shadow of a smoke-charred Israeli watchtower. Those allowed to cross Kalandia by car can take more than an hour. The passage for those on foot looks like a cattle pen. Israel could do much more to make the crossing less awful—more lanes for cars, more staff to process travellers, more effort to clean up the place—without endangering its security. Here Israel’s talk about the eternal unity of Jerusalem is exposed as hypocrisy. The wall cuts off areas that are formally part of the city, forming twilight zones for East Jerusalem’s Palestinians where housing is cheaper but public services are neglected. Arij, a student, picks her way past the fetid rubbish by the wall as she returns to East Jerusalem from Birzeit University, a commute of two-and-a-half hours each way. She does not speak Hebrew, so could not go to an Israeli university. “I don’t know any Jews. I am not ready to make friends with them,” she says. Most Israelis are not interested either.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/24/the-challenge-of-making-palestinian-wine,"The vines are heavy with grapes, the harvest just a few days away. Yet Sari Khoury is stressed: he cannot find workers to pick grapes in his vineyards. Proud owner of the Philokalia label, he is one of a handful of Palestinians in the West Bank producing wine under the trickiest of circumstances: Israel’s occupation. A “separation wall” between Israel proper and most of the Palestinian territory it occupies towers above Mr Khoury’s cellar in Bethlehem. Mr Khoury’s vineyards are hemmed in by Gush Etzion, a cluster of Jewish settlements nudging the south of the city. Constant niggles of the occupation abound. In 2014 Mr Khoury gave up his job as an architect in Paris to return home to requite his passion for wine. A year later he was producing hundreds of bottles as one of the West Bank’s handful of wine producers to use only indigenous grapes. Now he fills 10,000 bottles a year. The business of wine-making is testing enough at the best of times. The headaches of production under military occupation are even more painful. Mr Khoury is short of labourers because Palestinians can earn five times as much across the wall in Israel. And it is virtually impossible to get a permit from the Israeli authorities to expand his type of business physically.  “I can’t even build a shed for my tools,” he explains. “I have to bring them with me in the car every time.” Other big obstacles are the Israeli checkpoints that hamper his logistics and the scarcity of water that is guzzled by the nearby Jewish settlements. Many Israeli wineries grow European grapes that need a lot of irrigation. But the lack of water supplies for Palestinians in the West Bank means that they struggle to grow the likes of Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon. Hence Mr Khoury’s focus on local varieties such as Dabouki and Jandali that need less water and can survive the baking sun. Mr Khoury also emphasises sustainability, but warns against growing indigenous grapes as a gimmick. “I want to create the highest quality wine possible, to be judged on its merits,” he says. “That’s my resistance,” he adds, referring to Palestinian efforts to push back against the Israeli occupation.■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/1958/03/22/too-late-for-palestine,"PRESIDENT Nasser, who has a taste for anniversaries, was expected to celebrate one at Gaza last weekend. It is exactly a year since the Israelis left the strip, and prophets had whispered that he might declare a Palestinian republic there. Instead he made only a weak gesture; perhaps he is not sufficiently sure of his strength in the refugee areas not under his control to claim the allegiance of Palestinians everywhere. He gave Gaza a legislative council dominated by Egyptians and Egyptian-appointed members, and an executive council appointed by the Egyptian minister. This is far short of the independent status he might have used to rally all dispersed Palestinians. What held him back? Even within the narrow confines of the Gaza strip, he has to contend with a struggle between the indigenous land-owning families and the refugees. The Gaza families have a way of keeping on both sides of the fence, and the refugees have produced no real leaders. The former Mufti of Jerusalem can no longer be dusted down and brought forward as the leader of all Palestinians; he is now heard from only when it suits his Egyptian hosts. He has recently said that his ""All Palestine Government"" should be allowed to join the United Arab Republic, but too many refugees are aware of the complete ineffectiveness of that ""government,"" which, it is said in Gaza, withdrew to a coffee-house in Heliopolis, near Cairo, immediately after its founding speeches had been made in 1948. The only lingering evidence of its existence is its passports, issued by the Egyptian authorities to any Palestinian, and valid only in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. There may be another reason for hesitation over proclaiming a Palestinian state. All refugees of real competence have by now scattered far and wide, from Libya to the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms, where they have made new homes and new lives. They do not, on the whole, any longer expect to go back to Palestine. They simply like from time to time to recall that there are Arab families in North Africa who have kept the keys to their houses in Spain for hundreds of years. President Nasser may, of course, be saving the proclamation of a Palestinian state until he feels his citizens need another celebration. Outside Gaza, he can hope to gain support for a Palestine government only among the refugees in Jordan, where his agents are said to be hard at work. Until now, Jordan has been able to do very little for these refugees; but the new federation of Iraq and Jordan has more to offer them. If Iraq can cope with them simply by allowing them to be absorbed, without a publicised plan, without compulsion, and without foreign aid, any appeal to them to join a back-to-Palestine movement will fail. Iraq has only to offer them jobs, and the buses on the road to Baghdad will be crowded. What remains to be seen is whether it can make the best use of its opportunity before President Nasser stirs up the refugees by making promises which he would find hard to keep."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/20/arab-tourism-to-israel-is-still-thwarted-by-politics-and-palestine,"The indigo festival near the seaside southern foot of Egypt’s Sinai peninsula sounded jolly enough. Its organisers promised five days of “psychedelic music, sun and sea” in a mood of peace and love. Yet the fiesta has proved controversial, largely because the show was being run by Israelis. The Egyptian branch of a global campaign to boycott and divest from Israel denounced the organisers as “racist Zionist occupiers”. After Israeli police recently clashed with young Palestinians near Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque, the festival was axed. Israeli-Arab tourism is still blighted by politics and tensions over Palestine. Similar jamborees on Sinai’s southern coast, an easy drive from Israel’s border crossing at Taba, have become increasingly popular with Israelis, partly because they are cheaper than in Israel. Almost 700,000 Israelis visited southern Sinai last year. Tourists from Cairo and Tel Aviv rub along happily at the diving centres and beach resorts on the Red Sea. Some local Egyptian businesses advertise their wares in Hebrew and take payment in Israeli shekels. Visitors can buy T-shirts that say “I love Dahab”, one of the most popular spots, in Hebrew. Some Egyptians, however, are less keen. Last year many were irked by photos of an Israeli flag on the beach during the Hashmaliko festival. Egypt’s anti-Israel twitterati raged at two other gigs held in the week when their compatriots celebrated Sinai Liberation Day, marking the end of Israel’s occupation of the peninsula in 1982. Organisers’ efforts to promote such occasions as peace-building bridges between the two cultures have failed—especially since Egyptians are often not allowed to buy tickets. Few Arabs across the wider region seem interested in beachside bonhomie. The Israeli tourist industry hoped that the Abraham accords of 2020, which officially normalised Israel’s relations with Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), would cause an influx of holiday-making Arabs keen to see the Holy Land. It hasn’t happened. One reason is Arabs’ continuing anger about the Palestinians. Most Egyptians abhor the treaty that made peace with Israel in 1979. Polls say the share of Emiratis who view the Abraham accords favourably dropped from 47% when they were signed to 25% at last count. Still, the accords have encouraged Israelis to head for the Gulf. Last year 150,000 of them visited the UAE. A few chanced a first-time visit to Bahrain. But Israeli tourism to Egypt beyond Sinai has still not taken off. Last year a mere 45,000 Israelis flew directly to Cairo. Even fewer Arabs visited Israel as tourists. Those from Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and the UAE, which provided most Arab visitors, numbered just 26,400, compared with 2.7m from elsewhere in the world; 5,100 were Egyptian and 1,600 Emiratis. Bahrainis, says Israel’s tourism ministry, were “too few to count”."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-palestinian-islamic-jihad,"ON THE EVENING of October 17th a blast struck al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City. Thousands of civilians had been sheltering there, alongside the sick. Palestinian officials say that hundreds died. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, and several Arab countries blamed Israel. Israel’s army, citing drone footage as evidence, said that the explosion was caused by a malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), another militant group. PIJ, which operates in the West Bank and Gaza, denied the allegation. On October 18th, on a visit to Israel, President Joe Biden also blamed “the other team”, backing up Israel’s account. What is PIJ and what threat does it pose in this conflict? Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas The group was founded by Fathi Shaqaqi, a Palestinian doctor, and Abd al-Aziz Awda, a Muslim preacher born in Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. The pair were students in Egypt in the 1970s, where they were members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the world’s oldest Islamist group. Mr Awda and Shaqaqi advocated violent resistance against the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. Inspired by the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, they hoped to establish an Islamic state on the territory of the British mandate of Palestine, part of which became the state of Israel after 1948. They thought the Muslim Brotherhood was insufficiently committed to the cause, and began recruiting for their own militant alternative. After returning to Gaza in 1981 they spent several years building support. The group claimed responsibility for several attacks on Israeli soldiers in Gaza in the early 1980s, at least half a decade before Hamas carried out its first attack. Throughout the 1980s PIJ was a loose network of military cells, with only a few hundred members in total. In 1988 Israeli authorities deported Dr Shaqaqi to Lebanon, where he was later joined by other PIJ deportees. While in exile these fighters formed ties with Iran and Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militia in Lebanon. PIJ members began participating in Hizbullah’s training camps. The group founded the al-Quds Brigades, a more structured military operation than it had had before. Seeking to undermine peace talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, it carried out a series of suicide attacks in Israel. The most serious, in 1995, killed 21 Israeli soldiers and one civilian. Despite their ideological similarities, PIJ has remained at arm’s length from Hamas. During the first Intifada, or “shaking off”, an uprising against Israeli rule that ended in 1993, the two groups collaborated on several operations but never formally joined forces. Hamas won an election in Gaza in 2006 and, after failing to strike a power-sharing deal with Fatah, its rival, fought a brief war for sole control of the strip in 2007. PIJ limits itself to armed conflict. It has never participated in elections and, unlike Hamas, has provided little support to Gazans. PIJ’s influence declined in the 1990s, after Israel jailed many of its fighters in the West Bank. But many were released around 2000 and PIJ’s military capacities have since grown, assisted by arms supplies from Iran. In 2014, PIJ fired more than 100 rockets from Gaza at Israel. It is the second-largest of around a dozen armed groups in Gaza, after Hamas. Its presence in the West Bank has grown recently, particularly in Jenin, a city in the north. In 2022 several brigades linked to PIJ carried out a series of shootings on Israeli military checkpoints. PIJ has played a large role in the violence that began when Hamas invaded Israel on October 7th this year. PIJ fighters are thought to have joined the attack, in which more than 1,300 people died. The group later claimed to be holding 30 Israeli hostages in Gaza; Hamas is thought to be holding around 200. PIJ has since claimed responsibility for several rocket and mortar attacks on Israel. Israel is preparing for a ground invasion to “destroy Hamas”. PIJ will be in its sights, too. ■"
https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/10/28/the-israelis-and-palestinians-are-still-haunted-by-their-history,"Enemies and Neighbours: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017. By Ian Black.Atlantic Monthly Press; 608 pages; $30. Allen Lane; £25. IN THE roster of new states established in the past century, the creation of Israel has been extraordinary. It is one of the Middle East’s rare functioning democracies, with an intense public debate and a robust court system. It has absorbed destitute Jews from around the world and built a flourishing high-tech industry. All this in the face of wars and the intractable conflict with the Palestinians in its midst. When, exactly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict began is hard to say. Devout Jews have long lived in Palestine, and the first Zionists arrived in the late 19th century. But many historians point to November 2nd 1917 as the starting point. On that day the British government vowed to use its “best endeavours” to create a “national home” for the Jewish people in Palestine, which it would soon take from the Ottomans. That vague yet fateful promise, contained in a letter from Arthur Balfour, Britain’s foreign secretary, to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, ran to just 67 words. But the Balfour declaration, as it became known, “combined considerations of imperial planning, wartime propaganda, biblical resonances and a colonial mindset, as well as evident sympathy for the Zionist idea,” writes Ian Black in “Enemies and Neighbours”, his wonderful new history of Palestine and Israel from 1917 to 2017. If Israelis see the Balfour declaration as leading to the birth of Israel some 30 turbulent years later, Palestinians regard it as a great betrayal. Balfour wrote that nothing should be done to prejudice the “civil and religious rights” of Palestine’s “existing non-Jewish communities”, which then represented about 90% of the population. But he did not mention the Arabs by name, nor did he consult them. Their outrage has hardly diminished with time. The declaration “is the root cause of our destitution, dispossession and the ongoing occupation,” the Palestinian mission to Britain told a parliamentary committee in April. Mark Regev, the current Israeli ambassador to Britain, recently pointed to the Palestinians’ rejection of partition, in 1937 and again in 1947, as proof that “their statelessness was self-inflicted”. He contends that the Palestinians “chose intransigence over independence in 1967, 2000, 2008 and 2014”. So entrenched have the views of each side become that, as Mr Black puts it, “history is an extension of the battleground on which Israelis and Palestinians still fight.” The former Middle East editor for the Guardian, a British newspaper, Mr Black, for his part, plays it pretty straight, offering a well-rounded tour of the past century. The book excels when describing the moral price the Jews have paid to form, protect and expand their new country. The fighting that erupted after the creation of Israel in 1947 caused 700,000 Arabs to flee or be driven from their homes. Most were not allowed to return. The Palestinians took to calling this the Nakba, or catastrophe. The stunning victory in the war of 1967, in which Israel launched a pre-emptive attack to prevent encirclement by advancing Arab armies, was bittersweet. It helped secure the permanence of Israel and the unification of Jerusalem under Israeli rule. But by taking control of the biblical heartland and a large population of Palestinians living on it, it also established a permanent occupation that erodes Israeli democracy. The patchwork of authorities in the occupied lands (part autonomous under Palestinian rule and part frontier for Jewish settlers), as well as the security barrier that keeps Palestinians in the West Bank out of Israel, invites comparisons to apartheid. Even before the two Palestinian uprisings, of 1987 and 2000, Israeli military rule was hardly gentle. By the mid-1980s, Mr Black writes, about 250,000 Palestinians, or 10% of the population of the occupied territories, had experienced detention or interrogation. Some Israelis had qualms. “In order to enforce order in the kasbah we must be brutally violent against people who are innocent of any crime…and this weakens me and strengthens them,” one Israeli soldier stationed in Nablus told the author during the first intifada. Even the perpetrators of the most heinous attacks seek legitimacy in history. Take the abduction and murder of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. The Palestinian planners called it Operation Ikrit and Biram, after two villages in Galilee that were taken by Israel in 1948. The attack was carried out by a group called Black September, a reference to the period in 1970 when Jordan drove thousands of guerrillas from the Palestine Liberation Organisation out of the country. The Jordanians were troubled by the Palestinians’ violent ambition, as demonstrated by their attack on the American embassy in Amman in 1968—on the 51st anniversary of the Balfour declaration. Mr Black sprinkles his book with fascinating nuggets. David Ben-Gurion, then an MP, proposed tearing down the 16th-century Ottoman walls surrounding the Old City of Jerusalem after Israel’s victory in 1967. (Wiser heads prevailed.) Ariel Sharon, then a general, recounted how in the 1970s the army infiltrated its own phoney terrorists into Gaza, then chased them with helicopters and search parties until real terrorists made contact with them. But the book may leave some readers wanting more—about European diplomacy during the first world war; or about the Arab families who sold their land to Zionists. Plenty of other books fill the gaps. For its clarity and balance, though, Mr Black’s work stands tall in a field that is likely to continue growing. As he notes, by 2017 “the prospect of an equitable two-state solution being agreed voluntarily by both sides was extremely dim.” Mr Netanyahu’s government, perhaps the most right-wing in Israel’s history, seems uninterested in real Palestinian statehood. The Palestinians, long divided, are unable to make tough decisions. As Israel celebrates the centenary of the Balfour declaration, Palestinians plan to mark it with protests—as they have done every year since 1918. Correction (October 27th 2017): Following a request from the author, we have changed the name of the MP that proposed tearing down the Ottoman walls from Shimon Peres to David Ben-Gurion."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2007/11/22/mr-palestine,"Getty images  GEORGE BUSH is not likely to be remembered by history as the saviour of the Middle East. He botched Iraq, dropped his democratic “freedom agenda” when the Arabs started voting for the wrong people, and has spent most of his two terms more or less ignoring Palestine. On this last front, however, he now has an opportunity for redemption.  If all goes to plan, Mr Bush will preside on November 27th over a peace meeting in Annapolis, Maryland. Expectations of this one-day event are at rock bottom. Nobody foresees much more than some bland speechifying and a photo-opportunity. And yet, if he is bold, Mr Bush has it in his power to turn Annapolis into a significant step towards peace. All he has to do is pluck up the courage to make the right speech.  That may sound like a wild claim to make of an event already shrouded in defeatism. This is a party nobody is thrilled to have been asked to. Ehud Olmert is going because an Israeli prime minister cannot leave an invitation from the White House to curl in the in-tray. Mahmoud Abbas is going because after losing the Gaza Strip to Hamas he must show that he is still president of Palestine, if only in the eyes of the great powers. Not even the hosts seem excited. Condoleezza Rice, America's secretary of state, is a genuine if late convert to the idea that America can budge things in Palestine. But the rest of the administration appears to see Annapolis as a way to roll out the customary pieties on Palestine and so make it easier for America to line up its Arab friends against Iran.  Worse still, these modest ambitions have shrivelled as the day has neared (see article). Plan A was for Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas to talk to one another before Annapolis and make a joint declaration when they arrived. To give the Palestinians what Ms Rice calls a “political horizon” (ie, hope) this declaration was supposed to go beyond Mr Bush's oft-repeated but ephemeral “vision” of an independent Palestine and fill in the vital missing detail on borders, refugees and Jerusalem. But although the two sides have indeed talked in recent weeks they have not bridged their longstanding differences.  That is no surprise. With Hamas snapping at his heels, it would take immense courage for the timorous Mr Abbas to modify the Palestinians' mantra: a state on the 1967 borders, a capital in Jerusalem and the “right” of the refugees of 60 years ago to return to what is now Israel. And although Mr Olmert is at least the prime minister of a functioning state, he governs in coalition with men who hate the very idea of an independent Palestine and have worked sedulously to tie his hands. Polls show that many Israelis long to be rid of the Palestinian territories. But even they wonder how they can trust Mr Abbas's ramshackle Palestinian Authority to police a state when it has already lost Gaza to the rocket-firing rejectionists of Hamas and might well lose the West Bank too.  In the absence of a pre-Annapolis meeting of minds, America has therefore moved to Plan B. There may still be a joint declaration, but it will be vague. It will pay homage to the principle of two states and recite the relevant, long-ago United Nations resolutions, which both sides know by heart but interpret differently. The two sides may then promise to sit down together the day after Annapolis to talk about borders, refugees and Jerusalem, with the hope of reaching agreement within a year. In the meantime, Tony Blair, in his new guise as the UN's midwife for Palestine, will set out his plans to strengthen the economy and institutions of the West Bank in preparation for the independence that will come, some day. Are such modest aims worth going to Annapolis for? Just about. If Mr Bush gets the Saudis and Syrians as well as the Egyptians and Jordanians to show support in Maryland, this may boost and embolden Mr Abbas, at least for a while. If Annapolis leads to economic help and makes Israel free up movement on the West Bank, the life of many Palestinians will improve. If talks about borders, refugees and Jerusalem really do start right away, this will be a change: Israel previously cited the “road map” of 2003 as a reason to pickle final-status negotiations in formaldehyde until the PA uprooted the Palestinian militias. And if Israel honours its own obligation to freeze settlement in the territories, this may persuade some of the Palestinians who have good reason to doubt it that there will still be room one day for a state of their own.  Plan B, in short, is probably better than nothing. But if he dares, Mr Bush has it within his power to make Annapolis so much more. He cannot bring a free Palestine into being at a stroke, or even within the final year of his own presidency. The Israelis are right to say that the divided Palestinians are in no shape right now to govern a state: at some point Hamas has first to be bullied, bribed or cajoled into accepting Israel's permanence and joining the peace camp. But Annapolis does offer Mr Bush the perfect chance to make a speech that could set the Palestinians fair on the path to statehood, and leave America's next president in a far better position to finish the job.  In this speech Mr Bush needs to set out forthrightly America's own plan for dividing Palestine. That would mark an historic change. In the past—in Madrid in 1991, for example, and at Camp David in 2000—the Americans asked the Israelis and Palestinians to thrash out their differences on their own. But they can't. The gap is too wide, and even when their respective leaders want to narrow it neither dares move towards the other for fear of the uproar from the ideological bitter-enders at home. The existence of an American blueprint that commanded international support would, however, immediately transform the political dynamic of both societies, fortifying the moderates and pushing the hardliners to the margins.  Although it would be too much to expect Mr Bush to unfurl a map at Annapolis, he could come quite close. For a start, he should make it clear that when America talks of a two-state solution, it has in mind a border based on the pre-1967 line. Three years ago Mr Bush said in a public letter to Ariel Sharon that it would be unrealistic to expect Israel to evacuate all the dense settlement blocks it has planted in the West Bank. Fine. But since most settlers live close to the old border, he can now tell Israel that it cannot keep more than a few percentage points—say 5% or so—of the West Bank, and that it must offer the Palestinians land from its own side in compensation. On refugees, Mr Bush should say, as Bill Clinton did, that their right to “return” should be exercised in the new Palestine and not in pre-1967 Israel: that is a bitter pill but it is the logic of a peace based on partition. And Israel too must accept a bitter potion: Jerusalem, the beating heart of both peoples, will have to be the capital of both.  If Mr Bush gives this speech, Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas will wax furious. They might agree with him in their hearts, but if only for domestic political consumption they will have to accuse the American president of setting an ambush, bullying the little guys, prejudging the final-status issues and riding roughshod over the views and rights of the people most directly affected. These fulminations can be safely ignored. Israel and the Palestinian territories alike are full of politicians who will tell you knowingly but off the record that only a deal along the lines described above stands the remotest chance of bringing permanent peace. It is high time the superpower and the rest of the world threw their weight behind such a plan. The photo-op at Annapolis may be just the place to do it. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/05/03/syria-is-erasing-the-palestinians-largest-refugee-camp,"WHEN the bombing finally stops, little will remain of Palestine’s capital-in-exile. Yarmouk, on the southern edge of Damascus, Syria’s capital, was once the Palestinians’ largest and liveliest refugee camp, sheltering displaced Iraqis and Syrians too. But two weeks of relentless bombing by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and his Russian backers has reduced it to rubble. Of the 350,000 people who once lived in Yarmouk, only a few hundred remain. Syria used to treat the Palestinians well. They were provided with health care and education and allowed to own homes. Many worked for the government. Mr Assad gave Palestinian security forces arms and training to police their camps. Khaled Meshal, the leader of Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement, had more access to the president than most of the cabinet. But when Mr Meshal sided with his Qatari financiers, who backed Syria’s Islamist rebels after the uprising in 2011, Mr Assad and his men fumed at the treachery. They blasted Hamas for using its tunnelling skills to dig escape routes for the rebels. Some of its members fought with more radical groups. In 2015 the jihadists of Islamic State (IS) took control of most of Yarmouk. Jabhat al-Nusra, an erstwhile al-Qaeda affiliate, grabbed the rest. When the regime was not fighting them, they battled each other. The latest combat is on a different level. More has been damaged in a fortnight, say residents, than in the previous four years. Al-Nusra’s fighters surrendered to the government on April 30th and boarded buses bound for Idlib, a rebel redoubt in the north. Its arsenal all but spent, IS is negotiating a similar deal, though it does not want to go to Idlib. Many Palestinians believe the regime wants to redevelop Yarmouk—for use by Syrians. In March the government unveiled the second stage of a plan to rebuild southern Damascus, including areas that run along the camp’s edge. Businessmen eye opportunities. Some suggest relocating the Palestinians to distant scrubland. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has remained neutral during Syria’s war and some Palestinian groups even fought with the regime on the camp’s frontlines. But there is little hope that things will return to the way they were. “We’ll increasingly face a climate in which we cannot continue to live,” says a refugee from Yarmouk, now in London."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/can-the-palestinian-authority-control-gaza-if-hamas-is-ousted,"AS ISRAELI TROOPS prepare to invade Gaza, one question keeps coming up: who should take control of it after they have rooted out Hamas—if, indeed, they are able to do so? Many, especially Israel’s allies, are looking to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which was thrown out of Gaza by Hamas almost two years after Israel withdrew its troops and dismantled its settlements there in 2005. But the PA seems to be in no position to take charge of the coastal enclave. In fact there are no guarantees that by the end of this war it will even be in control of Ramallah, the de facto capital city of the West Bank. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas Born out of the Oslo Accords of 1993, the PA was supposed to be the basis of a future Palestinian state. But as the prospects of that state’s establishment have receded, so has confidence in the PA, which is led by the 87-year-old Mahmoud Abbas (pictured) and is widely seen by Palestinians as corrupt and incompetent. Mr Abbas was elected to serve a four-year presidential term in 2005—and has been there ever since. “There is not really a whole lot left in the legitimacy tank of the PA,” says Salam Fayad, a former prime minister of the PA. “Unless they really change course very rapidly, the whole thing could fall.” Partly because it has been unable to protect Palestinian civilians on the West Bank from  attacks by Israeli settlers or halt the expansion of Israeli settlements, the PA has lost control of security in swathes of the West Bank to militant groups such as Kata’ib Jenin and the Lions’ Den in Nablus in recent years. The slaughter of 1,400 Israelis by Hamas on October 7th, Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Hamas in Gaza, and a sharp increase in attacks by settlers have all pushed it into an even more precarious position. In a poll in September, 53% of Palestinians said they thought an “armed struggle” against Israel was the best way to establish a state, compared with just 20% favouring negotiations. As the war in Gaza goes on, along with the flow of pictures coming out of the enclave that show civilians killed by Israel’s bombing, Hamas’s popularity appears to be increasing, while the PA’s seems to be plummeting. When news broke of an explosion at Gaza’s Ahli Arab hospital, furious crowds thronged into the streets of the West Bank. Their anger was not, however, directed at Israel, which most Palestinians believe bombed the hospital. (A more likely explanation for the blast, according to independent analysts and Western intelligence agencies, is that it was caused by a misfired rocket launched from Gaza by Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group.) Instead anger was directed at the PA. Hundreds marched on Mr Abbas’s presidential compound in Ramallah. In an echo of the protests that rocked Arab countries and toppled governments in 2011, many chanted: “The people want the fall of the president.” Fatah, the Palestinian faction led by Mr Abbas that dominates the PA, was already riven by infighting over who would succeed him. Now it is being further torn apart over its stance on Hamas. Those close to the leader believe Fatah—and the PA, with which it has become synonymous—can muddle through to see the crushing of its Islamist rival, which could perhaps give it a chance to take back control of Gaza. However, many among the party’s rank and file think differently. “A collapse [of Hamas] in Gaza will lead to a collapse in Fatah,” says a Fatah official in Ramallah, as he agonised over the safety of his relatives in Gaza. Even those who have little love for Hamas and its Islamist fervour are dismayed by the prospect of its being wiped out by Israel. They are urging Mr Abbas to set aside factionalism and to rally the secular Fatah movement behind Hamas in a unity government. “Both sides need each other,” says Raed al-Debiy, a Fatah official in Nablus, the West Bank’s biggest city. “Hamas needs the international legitimacy of Fatah, and Fatah and the PA need the popularity of Hamas.” The PA’s legitimacy crisis is being intensified by a financial one. Although the PA has not been able to evolve into an independent Palestinian state, many Palestinians accept it simply as a source of salaries and public-sector work. Yet it seems it may not be able to provide even these. In the next few weeks the PA is scheduled to pay public-sector salaries, including the wages of 34,000 members of the Palestinian Security Forces. But it can afford to pay less than 50% of this month’s wage bill, according to one senior PA official, who added that, even before the current war in Gaza, Israel was withholding customs revenues which it is obliged to hand over. This cash crunch is likely to become more acute as a result of the war because Israel has closed its borders to the thousands of West Bank Palestinians who usually work in Israel and pay income taxes to the PA. Members of PA’s security forces are already accused by friends and family of being proxies  for Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. In many cases, the only thing that keeps them from leaving their posts is their monthly pay-cheque. The PA has weathered previous financial storms and paid salaries late, or been unable to pay them in full, in the past. But the latest projected pay cut is far larger. If it goes ahead, tens of thousands of young men in the PA’s police and national security forces may not show up to work. Some would be ripe recruits for other armed groups in the West Bank including Hamas and Islamist Jihad, the group that may have been responsible for the hospital blast in Gaza. In any case, it is hard to see how unpopular and unpaid security forces will stand their ground if Palestinians try to sack the presidential palace. “The Palestinian public is reaching a boiling point and an explosion against the authority,” says Amjad Bashqar, a Hamas official in Nablus. “The only thing delaying it is our focus on the resistance [against Israel]”. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/13/only-negotiations-can-bring-lasting-peace-to-israel-and-palestine,"IT WAS A confrontation waiting to happen, in a conflict the world would rather ignore. Israelis and Palestinians have once again goaded each other to the brink of war in the Holy Land. Hundreds of rockets, fired by Palestinian militants, have been aimed at Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and southern Israel. Gaza, the Palestinian territory run by Hamas, a violent Islamist movement, has been hit even harder by Israeli air strikes. Arabs and Jews have clashed in the streets of Israeli cities. Dozens of people, most of them Palestinian, have been killed. The worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in years has Jerusalem at its heart, as so often (see Middle East & Africa section). In April, at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israel’s police chief fenced off the plaza around the Damascus Gate, one of the entrances to Jerusalem’s old walled city and a gathering spot for Palestinians. The move, made for “security reasons”, led to clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police. Hundreds were injured. Then the rockets started flying. The violence, as ever, is counterproductive. Turning Israeli cities “into hell”, as Hamas threatens, will not help the Palestinians who suffer grievously in Gaza—just the opposite, in fact. Every rocket that Hamas fires makes it easier for Israel to claim that it has “no partner for peace” and to intensify its siege of Gaza. But Israel, too, must reconsider its strategy. Its leaders view the broader conflict as something to be managed, not solved. Yet its unjust treatment of the Palestinians stores up trouble. Today’s crisis was predictable—even if the spark that ignited it was not. Jerusalem epitomises the problem. Israel claims the city as its “eternal and undivided capital”. But its inhabitants are irrevocably split. The eastern part of the city, although captured by Israel in 1967, remains largely Palestinian. The Oslo accords of 1993 left the city’s status to be settled in a permanent peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. But Israel has built a wall separating Jerusalem from the Palestinian hinterland. It seeks to strengthen its claim to the whole city by ringing it with new Jewish homes and squeezing Palestinians out. Though they make up 38% of Jerusalem’s population, most local Palestinians are not citizens but mere “residents”, granted access to health care and social security, but not the same rights as Jews. This disparity in the law is at the heart of a case before Israel’s Supreme Court that is making the atmosphere more febrile. The court is reviewing a judgment to evict Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem. Their homes sit on land that was owned by Jews before Jordan occupied the eastern part of Jerusalem in 1948. Israeli law allows the heirs of the original owners to reclaim property in East Jerusalem. Yet Palestinians cannot claim their former homes in West Jerusalem (or anywhere else in Israel). No wonder Palestinian residents of the city are always ready to protest. The injustices elsewhere are worse. Palestinians in the wider West Bank, like those in Jerusalem, have watched Israel confiscate land and build settlements on occupied territory, which is illegal under international law. They must also deal with Israeli checkpoints and an onerous permit regime. In Gaza more than 2m Palestinians have been cut off from the world by Israeli and Egyptian blockades since 2007, when Hamas grabbed control. The territory struggles to keep the lights on; the tap water is filthy. Despair at such conditions led to violence in 2018 and 2019, and is feeding the current spasm. Yet Israeli politicians ignore the conflict. The Palestinian issue did not feature in any of the four elections Israel has recently held. Most Israelis are comfortable with the “anti-solutionism” of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who shows little interest in pursuing a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. His domestic rivals are edging closer to a deal that would push him out of power. But, before the recent violence, they said little about how they would handle the conflict. Palestinian leaders have made it easy for Israel to give up on peace. Hamas is more interested in firing rockets than improving the lives of Gazans. Its rival, Fatah, has not done much better in the West Bank. The party’s leader, Mahmoud Abbas, is in the 17th year of a four-year term as Palestine’s president. He seems concerned mainly with preserving his own power. On April 29th, blaming Israel for restricting voting in East Jerusalem, he indefinitely postponed elections that Fatah was likely to lose. With little hope of a better future, a good number of young Palestinians favour confronting Israel. That makes repeated fits of deadly violence inevitable. Only negotiations will bring lasting peace. Western and regional powers should press for them to resume; Israeli and Palestinian leaders should come to the table. Solving the conflict will be even harder than managing it. But talking is the one permanent way out. ■ A version of this article was published online on May 12th, 2021"
https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/05/a-new-book-revisits-a-bus-crash-that-killed-palestinian-children,"It began, as many accidents do, mundanely. A bus was ferrying a group of five- and six-year-old Palestinian children on a school trip. But there was heavy rain, and the bus collided with a truck on a road in the West Bank near Jerusalem. The bus went up in flames, killing eight Palestinian children and one of their teachers. In “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama” Nathan Thrall, an American author who lives in Jerusalem, examines the events leading up to the accident in 2012 and the heart-rending aftermath. Abed Salama is the father of one of the children involved. The book, which began as an article in the New York Review of Books published two years ago, is about the individuals affected by the accident. But, like a lot of writing about Israelis and Palestinians, the story is also about the history of two peoples living next to each other. It tries to answer what contributed to the horrors of that rainy day. In his book Mr Thrall captures both the universality and the specificity of the experiences of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. He recounts details any parent will recognise: the anxious chasing of the school’s secretary to pay for a trip; the last-minute dash to buy chocolate milk and crisps; the children staggering under backpacks “too large for their small bodies” as they clamber excitedly onto the coach. He also evokes details that will make parents’ stomachs churn: the urgency of the hunt for your child in a hospital, racing from one room to another; the flare of hope when you are told that your son was probably not on the bus that crashed (only to later learn the truth); the mother turning over in her mind the fact that she had almost refused to allow her son to go on the trip because the weather was so bad. Accidents happen everywhere, every day. But Mr Thrall’s contention is that the horror was made worse because of the ways in which Palestinians’ lives are so strongly shaped and controlled by Israel and that the accident’s causes can be traced to the occupation. He makes this case convincingly. As he weaves in history, Mr Thrall’s decade as director of the Arab-Israeli Project at the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, is evident. He describes the colours of the different ID cards held by Palestinians and how they define people and constrain their movement. He introduces the architect of the wall that separates the occupied West Bank from Israel proper and traces its design and impact. The depth of Mr Thrall’s knowledge adds weight to his judgments, though there are parts that read a bit too much like a think-tank report. Understanding the status of the West Bank and reckoning with what that actually means for Palestinians living there feels pertinent, given the desire of some members of Binyamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition to annex the area. Mr Thrall harnesses a now mostly forgotten accident and connects it to this recent history. For Palestinians living in the West Bank the wall limited their access to services, such as ambulances and police. Those areas deteriorated as infrastructure collapsed and drugs spread. Schools were awful. Parents who could afford it sent their children to private schools, which were largely unregulated. It was one of these schools that hired an illegally registered bus, which travelled along a congested, neglected route known as “the death road” before it crashed. “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama” is hard to characterise: it is part history, journalism, diatribe and lament. But the book builds a relentless case that this crash and the ensuing trauma must be remembered. It was all so predictable—and could easily happen again. ■ Correction (November 30th): A previous version of this article stated that eight Palestinian children were killed in the bus crash.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/05/26/the-leader-of-hamas-in-gaza-is-the-most-influential-man-in-palestine,"YAHYA SINWAR, 56, has spent his entire adult life in prisons: the concrete Israeli sort and the open-air prison that is Gaza. Yet Mr Sinwar is now, arguably, the most influential man in the Palestinian territories. On May 16th, two days after Israeli soldiers killed about 60 Palestinian protesters at the border fence, Gazans huddled around televisions to learn if the violence would push their scarred enclave into another war. They were not listening to Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, or even Ismail Haniyeh, the nominal leader of Hamas, the jihadist group that runs Gaza. They were watching Mr Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza, who may one day represent all Palestinians. He was under pressure from militants to avenge the dead. But Mr Sinwar announced on Al Jazeera that Hamas would pursue “peaceful, popular resistance”. (Less publicly, the group discouraged people from returning to the border fence.) It was an unexpected declaration by Hamas, which many countries consider a terrorist organisation. That it was delivered by Mr Sinwar made it all the more striking. Born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza, Mr Sinwar became an early member of Hamas and helped to create its secret police. The force was charged with identifying and killing Palestinians who collaborated with Israel. Mr Sinwar carried out some of the killings himself. In 1988 an Israeli court sentenced him to four life terms in prison. There he would remain for more than two decades. The turning-point came when Israel negotiated a prisoner swap to free Gilad Shalit, a soldier captured and held by Hamas. The Israelis used Mr Sinwar as an interlocutor. He was allowed to talk to Hamas’s leaders, who wanted more than 1,000 of their own released in exchange for Mr Shalit. Israel vetoed a few of the names on their list. Mr Sinwar was not among them; in 2011 he walked free. Some Israelis came to regret that choice as they watched him become a commander in the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. Founded in the 1980s, Hamas has always been fractious, split between the rough men of Qassam and the more pragmatic politburo. The schisms deepened after Hamas’s third war with Israel, in 2014, which left around 2,300 Palestinians (and 70 Israelis) dead. Mr Sinwar’s background, his long years in Israeli jails and his reticent demeanour all gave him clout with the militant cadres. But Israeli analysts thought he would struggle to play politics. They were wrong. When Mr Sinwar was selected to run Gaza by the politburo last year, both Israelis and Palestinians wondered—and feared—what kind of leader he would be. Gadi Eizenkot, the Israeli army chief, said his appointment erased the distinction between the political and military wings of Hamas. Gazans feared that a man who had spent so long in prison would be erratic and aggressive. Those who know him best paint a more complex picture. One of his Israeli interrogators recalls him as “extremely hardline and at the same time ruthlessly pragmatic”. The same assessment, almost word for word, comes from Muhammad Dahlan, a former Palestinian security chief exiled to the United Arab Emirates. They grew up together in Khan Younis, playing football in its dusty streets. Now they have a quiet partnership. Even though Mr Dahlan hails from Fatah, a nationalist party that is Hamas’s bitter rival, he has steered Emirati money to Gaza and helps Hamas negotiate with Egypt, which controls the strip’s southern border. Mr Sinwar has marginalised the diaspora leaders who once ran Hamas from comfortable homes in Beirut, Istanbul and the Gulf. He has also silenced hardline voices in Gaza—for now. Hamas spent years digging a network of underground tunnels as a way to sneak fighters across the border and bring mayhem to Israeli towns. But since 2016 it has watched the Israeli army identify and destroy them, with the help of new, classified technology. Muhammad Deif, the commander of the Qassam Brigades, wanted to use the tunnels before they were all closed. Mr Sinwar overruled him. None of this reflects a fundamental change. Rather, Hamas’s embrace of more peaceful action is tactical. Even Gaza’sfieriest militants admit that their meagrearsenal poses no serious threat to Israel. “We don’t have an army,” says Khaled al-Batsh of Islamic Jihad, an extremist group. Hamas pragmatists accept that a fourth war would be ruinous for Gaza, which is already suffering from decrepit infrastructure and awful services. “The most dangerous thing is that youth have started to lose hope [of] a dignified life in Gaza,” Mr Sinwar said in a meeting with foreign journalists this month, his first. “He is deeply ambitious,” says his interrogator. Mr Sinwar certainly looks more like a leader than the ailing Mr Abbas, 82, who recently spent time in hospital with pneumonia. Aides released a photo of him pacing the corridors in a bathrobe, a visual reminder of his doddering irrelevance. But if Mr Sinwar aspires to lead the Palestinians, he cannot do so at the helm of an armed group. The world will not recognise Hamas until it renounces violence. He has amassed more power than any Hamas leader in recent memory. Now he will have to decide just how pragmatic to be."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/01/17/an-israel-palestine-peace-conference-without-israel-or-palestine,"IT WAS, even by the dispiriting standards of Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, a futile concept: a peace conference without either of the warring parties. On January 15th diplomats from more than 70 countries flew to Paris for a summit against which Israeli officials had been inveighing for weeks. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, called it “rigged” and his defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, compared it to the Dreyfus trial. So the French government, keen to avoid the embarrassment of having Israel refuse to attend, did not invite either side. It was “like a wedding without a bride and groom,” quipped Naftali Bennett, Israel’s right-wing education minister. After a full day of debate, the diplomats issued a two-page declaration that urged both sides to “commit to the two-state solution…[and to] take urgent steps in order to reverse the current negative trends on the ground.” If that sounds familiar, it should. Parts of it were copied verbatim from the closing statement of the previous Paris peace conference, held in June. Reactions to it were apathetic. Israelis are more preoccupied with a criminal investigation of Mr Netanyahu, who has been questioned several times this month over alleged corruption (which he denies). Talk of an early election is in the air. Among Palestinians, politics is as stagnant as ever: the West Bank and Gaza Strip are run by rival parties, the nationalist Fatah movement and the Islamists of Hamas respectively; the unpopular Mahmoud Abbas is in the 13th year of what is meant to be four-year term as president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The real target audience of the organisers was in midtown Manhattan, not on the Mediterranean. No one knows exactly how Donald Trump will approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His views on the subject (as well as many others) are unclear and sometimes contradictory. The Israeli right is gleeful, however, about his pledge to move America’s embassy to Jerusalem, and by his choice for ambassador: David Friedman, who has said Israel should annex the West Bank, a move that would preclude the formation of a Palestinian state alongside the Jewish one. Moreover Mr Trump has said that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, will be the one to broker the peace between Israel and the Palestinians that has eluded all who have tried. He is hardly an honest broker: the Kushner family runs a foundation that has donated tens of thousands of dollars to West Bank settlements. All of this is anathema to the diplomats who gathered in Paris. They warned against “unilateral steps” in Jerusalem, a not-so-subtle dig at Mr Trump’s embassy plans, and reaffirmed last month’s UN Security Council vote to censure Israel over the settlements. The outgoing Obama administration declined to veto the measure, which passed 14-0. “There is a unity in the international community regarding the two-state solution,” said the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault. That unity is already showing a few cracks, though. Britain did not sign the Paris declaration, and expressed “particular reservations” about holding the conference so soon before the handover in America. Last month a spokesman for Theresa May, the British prime minister, criticised John Kerry, America’s secretary of state, for calling Israel’s government the “most right-wing” in history (though she says she still supports a two-state deal). Diplomats see an attempt to curry favour with Mr Trump. In truth, the Paris meeting felt less like a diplomatic summit than a farewell concert thrown by an ageing rock band. Mr Kerry, who from mid-2013 led nine months of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, has just a few days left in office. The host, President François Hollande of France, will step down this spring. And their catalogue, once edgy, now seems anachronistic. A plurality of Israeli Jews favour annexing the West Bank; two-thirds of Palestinians believe the two-state solution is no longer viable. Diplomats promised to meet again in Paris later this year. It may be difficult to justify the trip."
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/08/24/the-palestinian-cause-no-longer-binds-the-arab-world,"IN THE FIRST years after Israel’s founding, David Ben-Gurion promoted an “alliance of the periphery”. The father of modern Israel saw the Arab world as implacably hostile. So he sought ties with non-Arab states, chiefly Turkey and Iran, which both established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1950 (the first Muslim-majority countries to do so). The periphery looks rather different now. Israeli strategists point to Iran and Turkey as their chief regional adversaries: the first for its nuclear programmes and promotion of Shia militias, the second for harbouring Sunni Islamists, such as Hamas leaders. The Arabs no longer seem so implacable. Last year the UAE and Bahrain established diplomatic relations with Israel under the so-called “Abraham accords”; Sudan and Morocco followed suit. Fully half of Arabs now live in states that recognise Israel. This is not to say that the Palestinian cause has lost relevance. A glance at a television in May, when Israel fought an 11-day war with Hamas, showed otherwise: the bombardment of Gaza was an omnipresent fixture on the news. It is hard to speak with authority about public opinion in a region with such repressive regimes. But it is safe to say that most Arabs see Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians as a moral outrage—even if fewer think it can or should be wiped from the map. Most of Israel’s peace treaties in the Arab world are decidedly cold ones. Egypt reaped diplomatic and security benefits from its 1979 treaty, but Egyptians have few cultural or economic ties with their neighbour. The new Israeli envoy in Morocco struggled for months to find office space. Even so, the Palestinian cause, once a central issue to the Arab world, is now just one among many. No Arab state has fought Israel in almost 50 years, and no non-Palestinian group since 2006. In effect, the Arab-Israeli conflict, which once did so much to stitch together the region, no longer meaningfully exists. Even in the heady days of Arab nationalism, Arab unity was a stretch. The United Arab Republic (UAR), a merger between Egypt and Syria, lasted only three years. The rulers of Syria and Iraq, both adherents of Baathist ideology, were often at daggers drawn. And the potentates of the Gulf wanted no part in a nationalist wave they feared would crash over their own palaces. Egypt fought a ruinous proxy war with Saudi Arabia in North Yemen in the 1960s. The Arab-Israeli conflict was an exception. The “three nos”—no peace with Israel, no recognition and no negotiations—were shared policy for decades. Arab states banded together to fight Israel in 1948, 1967 and 1973. The defeat in 1967, which saw four Arab armies brought to heel by the Jewish upstart, played a big part in the demise of Arab nationalism. Nasser resigned, though he then reversed his decision. The defeat left him humbled: he was forced to sue for peace in Yemen. Mohammed Heikal, a Nasser confidante, quipped after the war that power in the Arab world had shifted from thawra (revolution) to tharwa (wealth). The shift was not quite straightforward: at first religion would supplant revolutionary nationalism. But today the region’s centre of gravity has moved to the rich Gulf states. Many did not become independent until the 1970s, when the Arab nationalist tide had already begun to ebb. Sheikh Zayed, founder of the UAE, spoke often about the Palestinians and called Israel an enemy. But he never needed to act on these words: the last Arab-Israeli war was fought less than two years after the UAE became a sovereign state in 1971. Even as a rhetorical device, the struggle with Israel has outlived its usefulness. “With all our love for the Palestinians, and our traditional support for them, there comes a point where we will no longer be able to sacrifice our interests for local struggles on the Palestinian side,” says a diplomat from a country that has normalised relations with Israel. One can quibble with this framing. The Gulf states had quiet security ties with Israel for years; they sacrificed little for the Palestinians. To call it a “local struggle”, though, underscores how little point it now has for Arab governments. In February an Emirati probe successfully entered orbit around Mars, making the UAE the first Arab state (and the fifth overall) to reach the red planet. The Emirates sought to frame this as an Arab accomplishment: for days billboards in Dubai offered “congratulations to the Arabs”. Assembled in America and launched into space by a Japanese rocket, the probe was hardly a wholly local endeavour. But the messaging was a sign of the extent to which the UAE sees itself as a regional leader. It may seem an unlikely candidate. It lacks Egypt’s size, Saudi Arabia’s religious clout, or the long history of Arab capitals such as Baghdad and Damascus. Citizens make up only 10% of its 10m population. Even its location, on the toe of the Arabian peninsula, is on the periphery, closer to Delhi than to Cairo. Many Arabs harbour chauvinism toward the khaleejis, desert-dwelling parvenus whose success stems from oil, luck and the hard work of foreigners. Yet many also aspire to live there. Dubai offers personal security and material comfort that are lacking in other Arab states. For decades that has been the main source of the UAE’s soft power. “We want to have a Middle East, and an Arab world, that is similar to the way in which we run our own country,” says one official. Emirati officials rattle off priorities that sound drawn from an IMF report: efficient, lean government; support for small business; investment in education. It can seem a caricature of bloodless, technocratic liberalism. But there is little altruism in the UAE’s regional policies. It invests in agriculture in Sudan to safeguard its own food security, and funds ports on the Red Sea to support its global logistics hub. It joined the war in Yemen only to secure allies in the south, then withdrew; it is now quietly building an air base off its coast. Most of all, the UAE has an aversion to mass politics. That is what makes Israel a logical partner, a state that offers cutting-edge surveillance tools, such as Pegasus software used to spy on journalists, activists and others. The Arab-Israeli conflict was an exercise in mass politics, instrumentalised by Arab leaders. The Abraham accords were its opposite: a way to shelve one of the few causes that resonates across the region but that Arabs have proved powerless to resolve.■ Full contents of this special reportThe Arab world: Identity crisisThe resistance axis: Pyrrhic victory for IranIslamism and its discontents: No solutionThe Abraham accords with Israel: A farewell to arms*Regional institutions: Talking headsSisi's Egypt: The new NasserismThe future: Staying at home"
https://www.economist.com/europe/2011/09/24/high-noon-over-palestine,"FOR blood-soaked decades the diplomatic game in the Arab-Israeli conflict has been summed up as “America plays, Europe pays”. American mediators from Henry Kissinger onwards have shuttled to and from Jerusalem, while the Europeans have become the biggest paymasters of the Palestinian Authority. Now fate has put the Europeans at the centre of the showdown over the Palestinian demand for full membership of the United Nations. The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, will square off with speeches to the General Assembly on the same day. Each carries a gun. Some in Israel threaten to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank and to cut off the Palestinians' customs revenues. The Palestinians can inflame the Arab street at a time of revolutionary turmoil, in which Israel stands perilously isolated after the breakdown in its diplomatic ties with Turkey and Egypt. Step in the Europeans, who are desperate to stop the fight, for many reasons. They think a negotiated deal is the best way to lasting peace. They fear a bust-up will radicalise their already-turbulent southern and eastern neighbourhoods. And they do not want to expose their own divisions. So far the Europeans are united only in silence, saying they will not declare themselves until they see what, precisely, the Palestinians are asking for. Does anybody care? Surprisingly, perhaps, yes. Although often mocked in Brussels as a mediocrity, Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign-policy chief, finds herself at the heart of Middle Eastern mediation. To some extent she has taken the role by default, as America has stepped back from peacemaking. Barack Obama has given up trying to force Mr Netanyahu to halt settlement-building in the West Bank. Tony Blair, the former British prime minister and envoy of the so-called Quartet (America, Russia, the UN and the EU) is discredited in the eyes of many Arabs, not just for his war in Iraq but also for supposedly favouring Israel. “He sounds like an Israeli diplomat sometimes,” says Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian negotiator. Lady Ashton, by contrast, has managed to win a degree of trust among Palestinians—her office in Brussels is decorated with a kite painted by children in Gaza—without losing the confidence of the Israelis. Mr Netanyahu has seen her three times in recent weeks. “We take her very seriously,” declares an Israeli official. “Her heart is in the right place,” says a Palestinian one. Both sides want Europe's support. It will not change the outcome in the UN: the Palestinians' quest for full membership is sure to be vetoed by America in the Security Council, but they can secure the votes in the General Assembly that they need to upgrade their status from a non-member “observer entity” to a non-member “observer state”—a rank comparable to that of the Vatican (and, in the past, of Switzerland and West Germany). But, as one Israeli official puts it, “the Europeans represent legitimacy.” European support for Palestinian membership could leave the Americans isolated in the Security Council. And without the backing of leading European democracies, an enhanced Palestinian status in the General Assembly would look empty. As ever, the Europeans would exert more moral influence if they acted in unison. Yet on the question of Palestine, especially, they struggle to speak with one voice. In February European members in the Security Council voted together—against a lone American veto—to denounce illegal Israeli settlements. But in 2009 they split three ways in the General Assembly over endorsing the contentious Goldstone report, which cited evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Israel (and Hamas) in the Gaza Strip during the 2008-09 war. Lady Ashton has tried to propose an alternative to full UN membership: the Vatican option, plus a Quartet statement setting out the terms and timetable for new talks on Palestinian statehood. This, she thinks, would give the Palestinians a tangible gain and maintain European unity. But the Palestinians have rejected her advice, in part because they doubt she can deliver all 27 EU votes in the General Assembly. On the face of it Palestinians have chosen principle over pragmatism. Why, they say, should they give up their right to UN membership to spare the EU's blushes? Yet the Europeans still see room for manoeuvre. It could take months for the Palestinians' membership request to reach a Security Council vote. And now minds in the Quartet are concentrated on trying to restart talks. The Palestinians have cocked the gun; the Europeans are trying to put it in a bulletproof box. Success would be a diplomatic triumph for Lady Ashton, but it will be hard. Neither Mr Netanyahu nor Mr Abbas seems ready or able to begin negotiations, let alone agree to lasting peace. Just say Yes So the Europeans in the Security Council could be called on to take sides. France may yet support Palestinian membership of the UN; the Germans will surely champion Israel; the British will probably abstain. From Charlemagne's perspective, not just as a resident of Brussels but as a former Jerusalem correspondent, it would be better for all three to support the Palestinian bid. This would keep alive the hope of a two-state solution. More than six decades after the UN voted to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, the idea is dying thanks to relentless Israeli settlement-building and the violent irredentism of Hamas and others. Yet as well as asserting Palestinians' right to statehood, the Europeans should say what they cannot have: an unfettered right of return for refugees to modern-day Israel. On these terms, France and Britain might be able to support the Palestinians, and the German government could abstain. Nobody expects Germany, with its Holocaust burden, to vote against Israel. But abstention would be a tacit Yes to a fair peace. Economist.com/blogs/charlemagne"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2003/03/13/an-alternative-mr-palestine,"Reuters  New leader, old grievance “HE IS not an Israeli agent, or anything like that,” said Amos Gilad, an Israeli general, of the Palestinians' first prime minister. Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, “opposes terrorism out of Palestinian interests, not Israeli interests,” he added. That he felt the need to point this out shows how much pressure the Palestinian Authority (PA) was under to appoint a new leader. The Israeli and American governments detest its current head, Yasser Arafat, and have said that the long-dead peace process cannot resume until his removal from power. They are reserving judgment as to whether Mr Abbas's appointment is a step in that direction; Hamas denounced it as a response to “American and Zionist pressures”.  In his newly-created role, Mr Abbas will run the day-to-day affairs of government, with responsibility for security and public order in the areas of the West Bank which the PA nominally controls but which are now mostly occupied by the Israeli army. Mr Arafat's autocratic grip will be weakened, but not removed. He will remain the authority's president, with the power to fire Mr Abbas. And as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), he will continue to reign supreme on matters to do with negotiations with Israel, foreign policy and “national security”. Mr Abbas will also be involved in negotiations with Israel, but as head of the PLO negotiation team, not as prime minister, and again answerable to his boss.  Palestinians hope that this division of labour will make the executive more accountable to their elected parliament. Israel and America are uninterested in new Palestinian elections; they want to see what actual powers the prime minister will have, particularly vis-à-vis the Palestinian militias that now rule in many of the disconnected Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps. So does Mr Abbas; he has yet to accept the nomination. A founder of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement, Mr Abbas has devoted his life to the Palestinian struggle, which gives him popular appeal. He is considered a moderate: as one of the main architects of the Oslo accords, he has long averred that Palestinians can only win independence by negotiation. In recent months he has become a vocal critic of the intifada, insisting that its “militarisation”, and particularly the suicide bombings, have tarnished the Palestinian cause and given Israel a pretext for oppression.  That said, Mr Abbas makes much the same demands as Mr Arafat does: a Palestinian state spanning all the territories Israel occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, and a “just” resolution for Palestinian refugees. Whether he will have any more success in realising these aims remains to be seen. "

By the summer of 1939 the uprising had been suppressed—but Britain later faced Jewish revolts and after the second world war handed the problem to the United Nations, which voted to partition the land. Areas A, B and CA messy patchwork of control in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, agreed in 1995 as part of the Oslo II accord. In Area A, which includes the main Palestinian towns, the Palestinian Authority was given full civil and security control. In Area B it had power over civil affairs and some aspects of law and order, but Israel retained ultimate security control. In Area C, which includes most Jewish settlements, Israel kept full control. See map. Armistice (1949)Peace deals signed after the first Arab–Israeli war of 1948. Israel and Arab states divided up the land. No Palestinian state was created; Egypt controlled Gaza while Transjordan (later Jordan) formally annexed the West Bank. See map. Axis of resistance Iran’s network of violent proxies and allies across the Middle East. It includes Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, Shia militias in Iraq, Hizbullah in Lebanon, militant groups in Syria and the Houthi militia in Yemen. Balfour Declaration On November 2nd 1917 Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, named after ​​Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary, stating its support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”. The document also insists that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine”.Binyamin NetanyahuIsrael’s longest-serving prime minister and head of the right-wing Likud party. Since December 2022 has led a coalition which includes far-right nationalist and ultra-religious parties. He was previously prime minister from June 1996 to July 1999, and from March 2009 to June 2021. Also known as Bibi. Since 2019 he has faced criminal charges for corruption and fraud. Black September A Palestinian terrorist organisation responsible for the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics of 1972. Blockade A restriction on imports into Gaza, imposed by Israel and Egypt since 2007 after Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group, took control of the territory. Camp David accordsSigned by Israel and Egypt in 1978, after the Yom Kippur war. In a peace treaty six months later Israel agreed to give back Sinai to Egypt, and to grant Palestinians autonomy. Disengagement from GazaIn 2005, at the end of the second intifada, Israel’s prime minister, Ariel Sharon, withdrew all Israeli troops and Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip and evacuated four of the 120 settlements in the West Bank. It also built a security barrier in the West Bank.East JerusalemA sector of Jerusalem annexed by Jordan after the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, then captured and annexed by Israel during the Six Day War in 1967. Legally it is as a corpus separatum, a separate entity belonging to no country, under the UN partition plan of 1947 but it is widely regarded as being part of the occupied territories. Fatah“Conquest” or “opening” in Arabic. The nationalist party led by Mahmoud Abbas that formed the core of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and dominates the Palestinian Authority, which runs the West Bank. Founded by Yasser Arafat. Its main rival is Hamas. Gaza cityThe largest city in the Gaza Strip. Gaza StripA 365-square-kilometre sliver of land, home mainly to Palestinians, wedged between Egypt, Israel and the Mediterranean. It was administered by Egypt after 1948, and captured by Israel during the Six Day War in 1967. In 2005 Israel “disengaged” from Gaza and pulled out Jewish settlers. It is home to roughly 2.2m people, many of whom rely on international aid, and has been run by Hamas, a militant group, since 2007. It was placed under siege, bombarded and then invaded by Israel in retaliation for Hamas’s attack in October 2023. Read our short history of Gaza. Genocide Defined by the UN as acts intended “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Israel’s critics accuse it of committing genocide against the Palestinians; Israel calls Hamas a genocidal group. Read our full explainer on how the term is misused. Golan HeightsA mountain plateau that dominates the Sea of Galilee. It was seized by Israel from Syria in 1967. In 1981 it annexed 1,800 square kilometres of the territory. Around half of the area’s population of 52,000 people are Druze Arabs. It is home to Israel’s only ski resort. Green LineA demarcation line drawn during the Armistice of 1949. It served as the de facto border between Israel and Arab states until the Six Day War of 1967. It forms the basis of Palestinian claims to a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with Jerusalem as its capital. See map. HamasIslamic Resistance Movement (“HMS” are its initials in Arabic), the Palestinian Islamist organisation which runs Gaza. It was founded in 1987 during the first intifada with the aim of destroying Israel and liberating the Palestinian people. In 2006 Hamas won a majority of seats in a Palestinian election and later formed a unity government with Fatah. In June 2007, after a brief civil war, it assumed sole control of Gaza, leaving Fatah to run the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. On October 7th 2023 more than 1,000 Hamas fighters crossed into Israel and killed 1,200 civilians and soldiers, kidnapping 240 more. Read our full explainer about Hamas. Hizbullah“Party of God” in Arabic. An Iran-backed militant group and political party based in Lebanon, which borders Israel to the north. It is dedicated to the destruction of Israel, and is the world’s most heavily armed non-state actor. Read our full explainer about Hizbullah. HolocaustThe systematic murder of 6m European Jews by the Nazis during the second world war. It is recognised by most as a genocide. Hamas and other Islamist groups deny the Holocaust happened. HostagesIsraeli prisoners held by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. On October 7th 2023 around 240 people were taken by Hamas from Israel to Gaza. Humanitarian pauseA “temporary cessation of hostilities purely for humanitarian purposes”, according to the UN. Such pauses are usually limited to a defined period of time and to a specific area. A ceasefire goes further—read our full explainer on the differences and why they matter. IntifadaFrom the Arabic verb “to shake”. It describes campaigns fought by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. The first intifada, which began in 1987, involved mainly strikes and stone-throwing. During the second intifada, from 2000 to 2005, Palestinians used guns and suicide bombs to blow up Israeli buses and nightclubs. Iron BeamAn Israeli defence system under construction which will use lasers to shoot incoming rockets or drones out of the sky. Read our full explainer on the laser-defence system. Iron DomeIsrael’s system of mobile batteries against short-range rockets and mortars, often fired from Gaza. (The country also has David’s Sling for medium-range rockets and Arrow for longer-range ballistic ones.) IsraelThe modern state of Israel was established in May 1948 by Jewish leaders after the withdrawal of Britain from Palestine. The name also refers to a kingdom in ancient Palestine comprising the lands occupied by the Hebrew people. See map. Israel Defence ForcesIsrael’s army. Largely made up of reservists with a small core of professional soldiers. Led in 2023 by Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi. Read our profile of General Halevi. Jerusalem A city in Israel, holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims. Under the UN partition plan of 1947, Jerusalem was intended to be an international city, part of neither the future Jewish nor Arab states. It was divided by Israel and Jordan in the armistice of 1949. The eastern half was captured by Israel in the Six Day war of 1967, and annexed as part of its “eternal and indivisible capital”. Most countries keep their embassies in Tel Aviv, but the United States relocated its mission to Jerusalem in 2018. Jerusalem dayAn Israeli holiday marking Israel’s capture of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in the Six Day War in June 1967. Khan YounisA city and a refugee camp in southern Gaza in which many of the current leadership of Hamas grew up. KibbutzAgricultural communities in Israel often run as collective economies. Kibbutzim close to Gaza were targeted by Hamas on October 7th 2023. League of NationsA forerunner to the United Nations. In 1922 the League gave Britain the mandate to run Palestine as an international territory. Lebanon war, firstFour month conflict between Israel and Lebanon in 1982. Known in Israel as Operation Peace for Galilee. Israel invaded in order to dismantle Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation which had taken control of the south of Lebanon. The war killed thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians, along with hundreds of Israeli and Syrian soldiers. The PLO subsequently moved its headquarters to Tunisia. In 1985 most Israeli troops were withdrawn from Lebanon, except for a border “security zone”. Lebanon war, second Conflict between Israel and Lebanon between July and August 2006. Launched by Israel in an attempt to destroy Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militant group and political party which had created a “state within a state” in the south of the country. Israel imposed a naval blockade, bombed Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, and invaded the south. Six years earlier Israeli troops had withdrawn from the security zone established in 1985. Mahmoud AbbasThe ageing head of Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank. Mr Abbas was elected to serve a four-year presidential term in 2005 but has remained in post ever since. He is also head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and of Fatah. Nakba“Catastrophe” in Arabic. The mass displacement of Palestinians that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. Around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were pushed out of their homes. Occupied territoriesThe collective name for the occupied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Oslo accordsIn 1993 Israel and the Palestinians, represented by the Palestine Liberation Organisation, signed the first Oslo accord, which set out a five-year period of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under a new entity, the Palestinian Authority. The Oslo II accords, under which Israel handed over security responsibility to the Palestinian Authority in parts of the occupied territories, were signed in 1995 with the intention of a permanent treaty five years later. That did not happen. Palestine Liberation OrganisationA Palestinian organisation recognised by the Arab League as the “sole legitimate representative” of the Palestinian people. Represents Palestinians internationally, including at the UN. Palestinian AuthorityAn autonomous government for parts of Gaza and the West Bank founded in 1994. Intended to be the basis of a future Palestinian state. Its first leader was Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Expelled from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. Widely seen by Palestinians as corrupt and incompetent. Palestinian Islamic JihadA militant group with links to Iran which operates in the West Bank and Gaza with the aim of establishing an Islamic state. Unlike Hamas the group limits itself to armed conflict. It has never participated in elections and has provided little support to people in Gaza. Read our full explainer about the group. PalestiniansA population of around 14m people who trace their origins to British-ruled Palestine. Around 7m Palestinians live in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Another 7m are strewn across the Arab world and beyond. Nearly 6m are registered as refugees. Rafah crossingA border crossing between Gaza and Egypt’s Sinai peninsula. Used during the war of 2023 to import aid. RamallahA city in the West Bank and the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority. San Remo ConferenceA conference of European powers and Japan held in Italy in 1920 during which the Ottoman empire was carved up. Britain was given a mandate to rule Palestine, the international territory envisioned under the Sykes-Picot agreement. SettlersAround 700,000 Israelis living in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Their presence is considered illegal under international law. Violence between settlers and Palestinians is common. Sinai peninsulaTerritory briefly seized by Israel from Egypt during the Suez crisis in 1956 and again in the Six Day War in 1967. It was returned to Egypt in 1982 as part of a peace deal. See map. Six Day War Brief armed conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbours in June 1967. Israel tripled its territory, capturing the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai peninsula. Israel has since moved to build Jewish settlements on some of the land occupied during the war. Suez crisisIn October 1956 Israel invaded Egypt, capturing the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip. The conflict was planned in collusion with Britain and France in order to allow them to regain control of the Suez Canal which they had run until Egypt’s president, Gamal Abdul Nasser, nationalised it in July 1956. America was outraged and pushed Britain to abort the mission. In December 1956 the Israelis withdrew from Sinai and in March 1957 they withdrew from Gaza. Sykes-Picot Agreement During the first world war Sir Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, and François Georges-Picot, a French one, were appointed to secretly divvy up the lands of the Ottoman empire. The Arab provinces were to be split up among European powers. Given its significance in Christianity, Islam and Judaism, Palestine was envisioned as an international territory. Tel Aviv Israel’s largest city and financial capital. Of the 96 embassies in Israel, 91 are located in Tel Aviv (the other five, including the American embassy, are in Jerusalem). TransjordanAn Arab kingdom under Hashemite rule, created by Britain in 1921 after the San Remo Conference. Now Jordan. Tunnels First built for smuggling, tunnels under Gaza are used by Hamas fighters to attack Israel and to hide from Israeli fire. After the October 7th attacks the Israel Defence Forces unleashed air strikes to damage the tunnels. Two-state solutionA proposed peace plan to end the Isreli-Palestinian conflict that is widely supported internationally. A Palestinian state would be formed in Gaza and the West Bank; Israel would swap chunks of its territory for portions with large settlements in the West Bank. Jerusalem would be shared, with some sort of joint control over the old city. UNRWA The UN’s Relief and Works Agency, which looks after the welfare of 5.9m registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East. War of IndependenceIsrael’s name for the war of 1947-48. On May 14th 1948 Jewish leaders established the state of Israel. On May 15th a coalition of Arab neighbours invaded. At the end of the war Israel increased its territory to include land the UN had intended for an Arab state, as well as West Jerusalem. Transjordan held the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Egypt held the Gaza Strip. The war was followed by the mass displacement of Palestinian Arabs, known in Arabic as the Nakba. West Bank Israeli-occupied territory run in part by the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians view it as the core of their would-be state. Right-wing and religious Israelis regard it as their ancestral territory, with many biblical sites, and are pushing for Israel to annex it in part or entirely. Home to increasing numbers of Israeli settlers. Yom Kippur war In October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria launched an attack in Sinai and the Golan Heights. The war lasted three weeks and ended with a ceasefire secured by the UN. Zionism A movement founded by Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jew, with the aim of creating a Jewish homeland. In the 1920s the movement was dominated by socialists, who went on to establish the state of Israel on socialist principles. In more recent years religious Zionism, an offshoot, which regards Zionism as a fundamental component of Orthodox Judaism, has become a powerful force. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/20/why-israel-needs-a-palestinian-state,"THE victory of Israel over the Arab armies that encircled it in 1967 was so swift and absolute that, many Jews thought, the divine hand must have tipped the scales. Before the six-day war Israel had feared another Holocaust; thereafter it became an empire of sorts. Awestruck, the Jews took the holy sites of Jerusalem and the places of their biblical stories. But the land came with many Palestinians whom Israel could neither expel nor absorb. Was Providence smiling on Israel, or testing it? For the past 50 years, Israel has tried to have it both ways: taking the land by planting Jewish settlements on it; and keeping the Palestinians unenfranchised under military occupation, denied either their own state or political equality within Israel (see our special report in this issue). Palestinians have damaged their cause through decades of indiscriminate violence. Yet their dispossession is a reproach to Israel, which is by far the stronger party and claims to be a model democracy. Israel’s “temporary” occupation has endured for half a century. The peace process that created “interim” Palestinian autonomy, due to last just five years before a final deal, has dragged on for more than 20. A Palestinian state is long overdue. Rather than resist it, Israel should be the foremost champion of the future Palestine that will be its neighbour. This is not because the intractable conflict is the worst in the Middle East or, as many once thought, the central cause of regional instability: the carnage of the civil wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere disproves such notions. The reason Israel must let the Palestinian people go is to preserve its own democracy. Unexpectedly, there may be a new opportunity to make peace: Donald Trump wants to secure “the ultimate deal” and is due to visit the Holy Land on May 22nd, during his first foreign trip. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, appears as nervous as the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, seems upbeat. Mr Trump has, rightly, urged Israel to curb settlement-building. Israel wants him to keep his promise to move the American embassy to Jerusalem. He should hold off until he is ready to go really big: recognise Palestine at the same time and open a second embassy in Jerusalem to talk to it. The outlines of peace are well known. Palestinians would accept the Jewish state born from the war of 1947-48 (made up of about three-quarters of the British mandate of Palestine). In return, Israel would allow the creation of a Palestinian state in the remaining lands it occupied in 1967 (about one-quarter). Parcels could be swapped to take in the main settlements, and Jerusalem would have to be shared. Palestinian refugees would return mostly to their new state, not Israel. The fact that such a deal is familiar does not make it likely. Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas will probably string out the process—and try to ensure the other gets blamed for failure. Distracted by scandals, Mr Trump may lose interest; Mr Netanyahu may lose power (he faces several police investigations); and Mr Abbas may die (he is 82 and a smoker). The limbo of semi-war and semi-peace is, sadly, a tolerable option for both. Nevertheless, the creation of a Palestinian state is the second half of the world’s promise, still unredeemed, to split British-era Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. Since the six-day war, Israel has been willing to swap land for peace, notably when it returned Sinai to Egypt in 1982. But the conquests of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were different. They lie at the heart of Israelis’ and Palestinians’ rival histories, and add the intransigence of religion to a nationalist conflict. Early Zionist leaders accepted partition grudgingly; Arab ones tragically rejected it outright. In 1988 the Palestine Liberation Organisation accepted a state on part of the land, but Israeli leaders resisted the idea until 2000. Mr Netanyahu himself spoke of a (limited) Palestinian state only in 2009. Another reason for the failure to get two states is violence. Extremists on both sides set out to destroy the Oslo accords of 1993, the first step to a deal. The Palestinian uprising in 2000-05 was searing. Wars after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 and Gaza in 2005 made everything worse. As blood flowed, the vital ingredient of peace—trust—died. Most Israelis are in no rush to try offering land for peace again. Their security has improved, the economy is booming and Arab states are courting Israel for intelligence on terrorists and an alliance against Iran. The Palestinians are weak and divided, and might not be able to make a deal. Mr Abbas, though moderate, is unpopular; and he lost Gaza to his Islamist rivals, Hamas. What if Hamas also takes over the West Bank? All this makes for a dangerous complacency: that, although the conflict cannot be solved, it can be managed indefinitely. Yet the never-ending subjugation of Palestinians will erode Israel’s standing abroad and damage its democracy at home. Its politics are turning towards ethno-religious chauvinism, seeking to marginalise Arabs and Jewish leftists, including human-rights groups. The government objected even to a novel about a Jewish-Arab love affair. As Israel grows wealthier, the immiseration of Palestinians becomes more disturbing. Its predicament grows more acute as the number of Palestinians between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean catches up with that of Jews. Israel cannot hold on to all of the “Land of Israel”, keep its predominantly Jewish identity and remain a proper democracy. To save democracy, and prevent a slide to racism or even apartheid, it has to give up the occupied lands. Thus, if Mr Abbas’s Palestinian Authority (PA) is weak, then Israel needs to build it up, not undermine it. Without progress to a state, the PA cannot maintain security co-operation with Israel for ever; nor can it regain its credibility. Israel should let Palestinians move more freely and remove all barriers to their goods (a freer market would make Israel richer, too). It should let the PA expand beyond its ink-spots. Israel should voluntarily halt all settlements, at least beyond its security barrier. Israel is too strong for a Palestinian state to threaten its existence. In fact, such a state is vital to its future. Only when Palestine is born will Israel complete the victory of 1967."
https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/3968522-hamas-gets-stronger-fatah-and-israel-get-scared-new-hamas-new-palestine,"AN EAGER crowd gathers in Beit Hanoun, at the north-east edge of the Gaza strip, to explain why it is so great to have Hamas running their town. Since winning 11 of the 13 council seats in an election in January, the Islamic Resistance Movement has cleaned up the streets, started free school buses and opened a women's centre. Projects for repaving, rebuilding and replanting areas destroyed by Israeli incursions are getting under way, and warnings that foreign donors would be wary of financing a Hamas council seem to have been baseless. Unlike before, council employees work full hours, official vehicles are used only for official business, and it is easy to get in to see the mayor.  Is there anything Islamic about it? “No,” smiles Walid Mohammed Ismain, a councillor. “We still have the picture of Yasser Arafat in the mayor's office.” Fatah, the late Palestinian leader's party and the ruling force in the Palestinian Authority (PA), is watching Hamas with growing alarm. The Islamists, who had never run in elections before this year, last week took a majority in 37 of 84 local councils. Fatah has claimed victory in up to 57, but in fact won only 30 outright. The rest are controlled mainly by “independent” councillors, some perhaps loyal to Fatah, but at least some of whom are disguised Hamas members, keeping a low profile to avoid being targeted by Israel. Hamas now has its eye not only on the third and biggest set of municipal elections, due in August, but more importantly, on the July vote for the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), which could give it a say in national policy.  Israel is also worried, for it sees Hamas as the chief architect of terror attacks (though pro-Fatah militias are equally active), and with an unclear position on whether Israel should exist (though it has shown signs of favouring a negotiated peace). Silvan Shalom, Israel's foreign minister, called for suspending the Gaza disengagement, set for mid-August, if Hamas wins control of the PLC. But other ministers slapped him down, one saying that such remarks strengthen the Islamists.  Many Gazans agree. “It's a free election campaign for them,” says Mohammed al-Masri, the Fatah ex-mayor of Beit Lahiya, where Hamas won a narrow majority last week. In fact, the local and national are quite different political spheres. Locally, Hamas campaigns as the party of social welfare and non-corruption, and its slogan that “Islam is the solution” or its support for armed resistance are secondary. Character or local standing often matter more than party colours.  The PLC election, however, will depend on how badly the PA, and by association Fatah, is doing. Reforms since Arafat's death have so far produced few visible effects besides the exit of a few of his cronies, and Israel is dragging its feet on concessions such as releasing prisoners, as it promised in February. Hamas has no chance of taking over the government. Most Palestinians, polls say, want a secular state. But they may give Hamas a big say in parliament if the PA has made no progress, or Israel does not dangle a few carrots.  Fatah itself has been scared into some sort of action. It adopted a fairer method of selecting candidates: internal nominations, followed by opinion polls to pick the most electable. But it is still making mistakes, says Mr al-Masri, such as failing to reach out to women as Hamas does. Some Fatah leaders argue that Hamas's appeal will wane because, by moderating its position and joining the political system, it will end up looking like its opponent. Yet Fatah policies in a fresher, cleaner package may be just what people want. "
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/27/why-are-so-many-of-the-victims-in-gaza-children,"To read more of The Economist’s data journalism visit our Graphic detail page. CHILDREN ARE a very high proportion of the victims of war in Gaza. According to the Palestinian health ministry, around 3,000 children were killed in the first 17 days of the war—roughly 40% of the total death toll. Although there are some concerns that number could be inflated—the health ministry is run by Hamas and President Joe Biden said that he has “no notion that Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed”—the ministry’s estimates have been broadly accurate in previous conflicts. In Ukraine, a conflict between two much bigger powers, children account for fewer than 550 of roughly 9,800 civilian fatalities over a much longer period. Gaza’s enormous child death toll reflects, among other things, its especially youthful demography. About half of the population of the Palestinian territories is younger than 20 years old, a much higher share than the average of other upper-middle income countries such as Iraq, Namibia and Thailand (see right-hand chart). The basis of a youthful society is a high fertility rate, the number of children a typical woman will have in her lifetime. The rate in the Palestinian territories, including both Gaza (total population 2m) and the West Bank (3m), was 3.4 in 2021, according to the UN Population Division. From 2017 to 2019 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) put it at 3.8. Detailed data that disaggregate Gaza and the West Bank are hard to come by. But, according to the PCBS, Gaza’s fertility was 3.9 during that period. These rates are far higher than those of neighbouring Israel, Jordan or Egypt and comparable to those of Ghana or Congo, both much poorer countries. A fertility rate this high is typically associated with short lifespans, poverty and low levels of female education. The Palestinian territories do not have those characteristics. Average income per person in the territories is $4,600 a year, higher than in Egypt and Jordan. (The figure for Gaza is thought to be considerably lower.) More girls than boys are enrolled in secondary education. The Palestinian territories are unusual in combining poor-country fertility with upper-middle-income social characteristics. Why? It seems likely that the long conflict with Israel and the influence of Hamas (which runs Gaza but not the West Bank) are partly responsible. Yasser Arafat, the former president of the Palestinian Authority, once said his people were conducting “a war of cradles”: population growth was a way to affirm Palestinian identity and perseverance. Hamas’s pro-natal rhetoric has been particularly vociferous. After taking control of Gaza in 2007 it sought to maintain the strip’s high fertility rate; which stood at 5.8 from 1999 to 2003, one of the highest anywhere. Fertility has fallen since, as it has almost everywhere. But Gazans born in the baby boom of 20 years are now having their own families. In 2015 Gaza had about two thirds the population of the West Bank, the historic centre of Palestine. At current rates, it will be near parity within 25 years, giving Gaza a bigger voice in the debate over any future Palestinian state. ■ Editor’s note (November 10th): This article has been updated since it was published."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/1998/10/15/a-state-called-palestine,"Reuters  MOUNTAINS heave in childbirth and a mouse is born, wrote Horace. A phenomenal amount of heaving has gone into the small Israeli-Palestinian deal on territory that may or may not be delivered from the three-way summit that was due to start on October 15th at the Wye plantation in Maryland. Before the meeting, the Israelis were sounding pessimistic. But Binyamin Netanyahu wants a second term as Israel's prime minister, Yasser Arafat wants to add to the disjointed pieces of land under his control and Bill Clinton wants the puff of a diplomatic triumph. The interim deal, which should have been a routine part of a timetable already agreed on, will be important not so much for its contents as for its existence: without it, no further progress is possible. If Mr Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon, his new foreign minister and the most predatory of hawks, decide to sign, it could, as our Israel correspondent suggests, lead to a realignment of Israeli politics (see article). After that, the way will be eased to the next, hugely difficult, search for a permanent solution to the whole Israeli-Palestinian mess. The peace-process timetable lays down that this solution should be in place by May 4th 1999. That is now unrealistic. But a frustrated Mr Arafat has said that, if things are still stuck by then, he will unilaterally declare a Palestinian state. If he does, replies Mr Netanyahu, the agreements underlying the peace process will be null and void, and Israel free to do as it pleases. The threat, and counter-threat, spell disaster. But it is a disaster that could be avoided if bargaining took over from sabre-rattling. The confrontational approach—yes I will, no you won't—is unrewarding. The principle of independence is generally accepted. A majority of countries already recognise the Palestinian state that Mr Arafat proclaimed from exile in 1988, when he formally renounced the Palestinians' claim to Israel itself. Most of the rest of the world is ready to do so. Making independence official would strip away a lot of humbug and double-talk, give the Palestinian Authority proper standing under international law, and force Palestinians to accept responsibility for their own self-government. The real question is not whether Palestine should be a state but what sort of state it should be. This is what Mr Arafat and Mr Netanyahu should be arguing about in the all-important “permanent” negotiations. Israel's Labour opposition is already open to the idea of Palestinian independence—and even Mr Sharon himself has said that it is inevitable. If Mr Netanyahu wants to prove himself the middle-of-the-road statesman that most Israeli voters could support, he needs to dump his far-right partners, seek Labour help, which has been offered to see the current not-yet-agreed deal implemented, and set about bargaining for the limitations on statehood that Israeli security demands. Other countries, from Austria to Andorra, enjoy sovereignty with strings. Israel would insist, and would be right to insist, on the tightness of the strings restricting a militaristic Palestine. In return for statehood, Israel will want annexed chunks of land, buffer zones, redrawn borders. All that can be bargained for but, in the end, Israeli security will depend less on territorial safeguards than on removing the cause for violence. And that means allowing the Palestinians not only a state but one that is reasonably decent. It does not mean fobbing them off with vulnerable bits and bobs of territory that can be sliced, one from the other, at an Israeli whim. Creating bantustans is a rotten prescription for a lasting peace. The argument over withdrawal that accompanies the Wye summit shows how hard it is for Israelis to step back from any of the land that many believe to be theirs by religious right. Since it remains the precondition for true peace, the argument has to be continued. But better still if, from now on, it is held in the framework of how much land and independence a state called Palestine should reasonably and safely have. "
https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2010/03/14/this-map-is-not-the-territories,"A FEW days ago Andrew Sullivan published a rather distorted map that misrepresents the history of land transfers from Palestinian to Jewish control in the territory of Israel and Palestine. It's not clear who initially produced the map, but Mr Sullivan got it from Juan Cole, the Middle East expert, who should have known better. Jeffrey Goldberg strongly objected to the map, but he did a poor job of explaining why the map is so confused and tendentious. Mr Sullivan then responded to Mr Goldberg's objections in a fashion that, because those objections were not well explained, also missed the point. It's a big mess. Here's the map in question: Mr Goldberg argued that the problem with this map is that it represents the territory in 1946 under the name ""Palestine"", implying that there had been a Palestinian state which was then taken over by Israel. But that's not quite the point. The point is that the map fails to distinguish between land that is owned by Jews or Palestinians, and land that is controlled  by Jewish or Palestinian political entities. Take the vast triangular tract of land at the south of the map. That's the Negev desert. Apart from a few small oases, kibbutzes and towns, it's empty wasteland; it isn't owned by anyone. It represents almost half of the territory of Israel/Palestine. In 1946, the map represents it as ""Palestinian land"". That's silly. In 1949, it has somehow become ""Jewish land"". That's almost as silly, though Jewish irrigation projects did gradually, over a period of decades, turn an increasing (if still-small) portion of the desert into arable agricultural land claimed by Jewish owners. But the impression the map gives is that in 1947-8, Jews seized that land from Palestinian owners, which is absurd. What happened was that a piece of empty desert which had been under the control of the British Mandate (who got it after the Ottoman Empire fell apart) was awarded to the Jewish state. This is a question of political control, not land ownership. Here's an even more obvious case. See that rightward bulge at the map's top right? In 1946, it too is green, and by 1949, it too has turned white. That bulge is the Sea of Galilee. It seems fairly straightforward that representing this body of water as ""Palestinian land"" in 1946 and ""Jewish land"" in 1949 is rather absurd. Even within settled areas, like the coastal plain, the Galilee and the West Bank, it's impossible to tell from this map whether ""Jewish land"" refers to land owned by Jews or land under Israeli/Jewish political control. What about land that continues to be owned by its Palestinian owners while politically becoming part of Israel? Such land is not represented on this map. And so forth. The map needs to distinguish four categories of land: land owned by Jews under Israeli political control; land owned by Jews but under Palestinian political control; land owned by Palestinians but under Israeli political control; and land owned by Palestinians under Palestinian political control. On the 1946 map, furthermore, there would need to be a different means of representation entirely, since there was, at the time, no Jewish or Palestinian political control. This map blurs the distinctions incomprehensibly, and it does so in a way that tendentiously maximises the impression that Jews have seized Palestinian-owned land. Jews, and the Israeli state, have, in fact, seized great quantities of Palestinian land in the territory of Israel/Palestine over the past 60 years. Israelis and Americans must acknowledge this fact to make any progress towards peace, and an accurate accounting of such seizures would be very valuable. But this particular map only confuses and distorts the issue, and seems clearly designed for propaganda purposes."
https://www.economist.com/newsbook/2011/01/24/the-palestine-papers,"FOR almost 24 hours, Al Jazeera, the Arab world's most popular news channel, has lead its bulletins with reports of outlandish concessions made by Palestinian officials during negotiations with Israel since 1999. So grave were the allegations contained in some 1,600 documents and 50 maps leaked to the channel, claimed commentators Al Jazeera drafted into its studios, they would end the last kicks from the dying horse of the peace process, and unseat the Palestinian leadership. If anything the first batch of leaked papers appears to do the opposite. It shows the Palestinians defending their corner rather well, and largely upholding previous positions. On Jerusalem, Ahmed Qurie and Saeb Erekat, the two main Palestinian negotiators during the Annapolis process begun in 2007, stuck to the parameters established by then-president Bill Clinton a decade ago of an ethnic partition of the city: the Jewish bits would remain Jewish, and the Palestinian bits Palestinian. Both men withstood Israeli pressure to extend the formula to two large Jewish settlements, Maale Adumim and Har Homa, to the east and south of the city. On Jerusalem's Old City, the epicentre of the conflict, Palestinians also restated positions established under Yasser Arafat, the former Palestinian president. They insist that the only part of the Haram al-Sharif, the compound containing Islam's third holiest mosque and the site on which some Jews want to build a third temple, that they would consider ceding to Israel would be the Wailing Wall on which the temple stood. In indirect talks after Binyamin Netanyahu became Israel's prime minister, Mr Erekat went a bit further—in ""a private"" capacity—by advertising his readiness to consider ""creative"" alternatives, and implied his readiness to consider the supervision of an international committee, a much-floated idea. As for the rest of the Old City, the Palestinian team insisted on keeping all but the Jewish and some of the Armenian quarters. How Al Jazeera's spin will play out amongst the Palestinian public is unclear. Allies of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, predictably denounced the messenger, sidestepping his message, by attacking Al Jazeera's offices. A senior Palestinian official, Yasser Abd Rabbo, blasted the Emir of Qatar, the small Gulf state that owns Al Jazeera, of conducting a campaign against Mr Abbas in order to project his regional influence. Ramallah's rumour-mill blamed Mohammed Dahlan, a former security chief, against whom Mr Abbas recently launched an investigation on suspicion of plotting to overthrow him. Only last week, Mr Dahlan's aides threatened to release embarrassing documents if what he termed the ""witch-hunt"" by Mr Abbas persisted. On current evidence, the leaks are just as awkward for Israel. They contradict the official Israeli narrative that the Palestinians rejected generous Israeli offers, and portray Palestinians as initiating ideas, only to be stymied by Israeli stonewalling. They give credence to Palestinian claims that Mr Netanyahu made no counter-proposals. Had a more responsive Israeli prime minister been in charge, or had the Obama administration picked up from where his predecessors left off, rather than frittering away two years on an elusive settlement freeze, a two-state agreement might yet have looked imminent. To date only the usual suspects, led by Hamas, Fatah's Islamist rivals who rule Gaza, have accused Mr Abbas and his aides of selling out. Inside the West Bank, there have been no reported demonstrations or calls for Mr Abbas to go. Whether the calm continues, though, could depend on Al Jazeera's next instalments. The channel is broadcasting trailers for further revelations on Palestinian security coordination with Israel, Mr Abbas's position on the Gaza blockade and the fighting in Gaza in the winter of 2008-2009. Tonight's promised exposé is on refugees. Should they show Mr Abbas and his aides compromising the Palestinian claim to the right of return for refugees uprooted in 1948 and 1967, his authority—particularly in the teeming refugee camps of Lebanon and Gaza—might be more seriously tested. Despite Al Jazeera's best efforts, though, predictions of a Tunisia-style toppling appear premature."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/10/13/how-palestine-might-become-a-state,"FEW areas of international law are as fraught as the issue of what makes a state. And few questions of statehood have been as fraught as Palestine's. On October 13th the British parliament voted that Palestine should be officially regarded as a state alongside Israel (though the government is not bound by this decision). The British debate followed the announcement on October 3rd by Sweden's new government that it was ready to recognise Palestine as a state (though it seems to have backtracked from this since then). How does a place become a state? The Montevideo Convention on the rights and duties of states, signed by 20 countries in North and South America in 1933, sets four criteria for becoming a state: a permanent population, a government, defined borders and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. But these are little more than guidelines. Many places recognised as states do not comply. Libya has more than one government. Many states emerged after national movements declared independence and then sought recognition by other states and admission into the United Nations. Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), declared Palestine a state in 1988 in Algiers, and has subsequently secured recognition from over 130 states, or over two-thirds of the UN. But Palestine’s admission into the UN has been tortuously slow. In 1974 the PLO won recognition as a ""non-member observer entity"" at the UN, a category shared by OPEC, the Arab League and the African Development Bank, among others. In 2012 the UN General Assembly upgraded its status to a non-member state, putting it on a par with the Holy See. This means it can apply for entry to UN bodies, and is now a member of UNESCO. However, Palestine needs the prior approval of the UN Security Council to be admitted as a full member state. Until now, it has failed to marshal the backing of at least nine of the 15 member states required to bring a resolution to the vote. Despite this, Palestine might try to table a motion to improve its prospects of statehood next month. The Palestinian delegation at the UN has circulated a draft resolution seeking an end to Israel’s 47-year-long occupation by November 2016 if negotiations with Israel have failed to secure a two-statement settlement by then. France could yet be the swing player. If it voted in favour, other countries might follow suit. Israel would then look to President Obama’s administration to veto the resolution.  For all the diplomatic machinations, Israel argues, with some Western backing, that the reality on the ground is what counts. The reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under prime minister Rami Hamdullah, an appointee of president Mahmoud Abbas, helps Palestine edge towards fulfilling the Montevideo attributes. But as one Israeli official points out, it still has two separate security forces, no defined borders or capital, and under the Oslo Accords is formally limited in conducting its foreign policy. In addition, Palestinians remain under Israeli military occupation with all but one of their entry and exit points controlled by Israeli forces. Only when negotiations which began in 1991 come to fruition, says Israel, can Palestine hope to gain independence and secure recognition from the states that matter. Palestine’s UN diplomacy might win it more of the international trappings of a state, but without a deal with Israel the reality for its people will remain the Israeli occupation.

https://www.economist.com/leaders/2002/04/11/from-here-to-palestine,"Getty  ARIEL SHARON invaded the West Bank in order, he said, to uproot terrorism and isolate Yasser Arafat. In the casbah of Nablus, the Jenin refugee camp and other towns and villages, Israeli soldiers appear to have killed several hundred armed Palestinians, and by most accounts many unarmed ones too. But it is Mr Sharon, not Mr Arafat, whom this onslaught has isolated. By defying the demands to withdraw issued by the United Nations, the United States and almost everyone else, Mr Sharon has enraged Israel's enemies, alienated its friends, and blackened its name in the court of world opinion. To judge by his rising popularity at home, Israelis consider their international reputation a price worth paying for better odds of not being blown up on the bus to work. But the personal safety Mr Sharon promises them is illusory. The daily suicide attacks that provoked Israel's invasion stopped for nine days after the army went in, only to resume on the tenth. If Mr Arafat's fief were a state, it might be deterred from future violence by Israel's overwhelming force. But it is now even less of a state than it was before, less able than before to restrain the suicide bombers even if Mr Arafat wanted to. And in the meantime it is not only Israel's good name that Mr Sharon is destroying. He is also destroying something more precious: the belief of Israelis and Palestinians alike in the possibility of a just compromise between the claims of the two peoples.  Trapped in their endless blame game, each side accuses the other of killing hope. Both are right, in that both have failed. Mr Arafat has failed to honour his promise under the Oslo accords to prevent the territories he controls from being used as a springboard for guerrilla and terrorist attacks on Israel. But Mr Sharon has failed to offer Palestinians any believable prospect that they might realise their aims by non-violent means. If this were just a case of refusing to bend under fire, Mr Sharon's failure might be forgivable; most Israelis believe that surviving depends on showing no weakness. The trouble with Mr Sharon is that he seems not to accept the principle upon which any imaginable peace must rest, namely Israel's evacuation of most of the land it conquered in 1967, so that a viable Palestinian state can arise in the West Bank and Gaza. Right now, he weeps crocodile tears over the collapse of the Oslo process he never supported. But under cover of fighting terrorism, he shows every sign of wanting to resurrect the vision of a “Greater Israel”, for ever in charge of the West Bank, which inspired Likud governments in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the Knesset this week, Mr Sharon promised to withdraw his army from the newly occupied territories, but only to “buffer zones”; to negotiate with a “responsible” Palestinian leadership, but not with Mr Arafat; and to seek a “long-term interim agreement”, not a final peace. He also expanded his government to take in the National Religious Party, led now by an ultra-nationalist who opposes any Palestinian sovereignty west of the River Jordan and predicts the eventual migration of the Palestinians out of the country.  If this is the fate that awaits the Palestinians after a ceasefire, Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, will have been wasting his time trying to arrange one. For such a ceasefire has absolutely no prospect of lasting. Having endured 35 years of long-term interim occupation, the Palestinians are in no mood to submit again to Israel's iron fist. As for Mr Arafat, it is no use Mr Sharon calling Mr Powell's decision to meet the Palestinian leader a “tragic mistake”. Like him or loathe him, whether he has condoned terrorism or not, he is the only leader whose legitimacy the Palestinians and therefore the rest of the world are prepared to recognise. If there is to be any sort of negotiated peace, it is going to need Mr Arafat's imprimatur. A negotiated peace looks more remote than ever. So the priority of George Bush, wary of tangling himself as Bill Clinton did in the arcane grievances of Arabs and Israelis, is to put out the fire before it spreads and complicates his plans for Iraq. But what a pity if this were the limit of his ambition. If the present mayhem shows anything, it is that the fire cannot be doused without also reviving hope. Israelis need to be able to hope that the terror will end without their soldiers having to stay in the West Bank to fight it. And Palestinians need to be able to hope that if the terror ends, the occupation will end too. If America is serious about restoring hope, it cannot rely on its existing three-step plan for ending the intifada: a ceasefire, followed by resumed security co-operation, followed by confidence-building measures such as a freeze on Jewish settlements. For a paradoxical consequence of Mr Sharon's war is that this progression of modest steps now looks even less realistic than an immediate “leap” to a final peace. The Palestinian policemen fighting today alongside Palestinian gunmen cannot be expected to turn their brethren over to Israel tomorrow. Israel cannot be expected to trust them to. And even if some miracle eventually got them to the negotiating table, the gap between Messrs Sharon and Arafat looks unbridgeable. This is why it is now time to risk that leap to a final settlement. This can no longer be based, as Oslo was, on the two sides making their own agreements and learning over time to trust one another; the gradualism of Oslo built hate, not confidence. So outsiders will have to do the work. For example, since Mr Arafat cannot or will not clamp down on terrorism, why not send an international force—armed, not just “monitors”—to take charge of security in the areas under his control? Since the parties cannot negotiate secure borders, as Resolution 242 of 1967 asked them to, why not have world powers—the “quartet”, say, of America, the UN, the European Union and Russia—map out such borders for them, and set a deadline for Palestinian independence? None of this would help a jot unless those powers, and especially the superpower, put sustained pressure on both sides to comply. But how disgraceful it would be if the answer to those “why nots?” was that the world at large, while calling piously for both sides to see reason, simply lacked the will to save them from each other. "
https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/08/03/a-distant-conflict-resonates-in-northern-ireland,"VISITORS to Northern Ireland need not venture far to discover that local people have strong views about another, even bloodier zone of conflict. In Catholic and Irish-nationalist parts of Belfast murals lament the sufferings of civilians in Gaza and proclaim support for hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners. In Protestant areas the Israeli flag is a common sight. One much-vandalised mural celebrates Colonel John Patterson, an Irish Protestant officer in the British army and ardent Zionist who commanded a Jewish legion in the first world war. Until a couple of years ago, a plaque in a tense part of north Belfast marked the boyhood home of Chaim Herzog, the late Israeli president whose accent recalled his native city. It was so regularly defaced that it was taken down. However much the two situations may differ, Northern Ireland’s rival communities identify with opposing sides in the Middle East with a passion which at times seems to exacerbate their local differences. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is helping to keep Britain’s Conservatives in power, takes a staunchly pro-Israel line, hewing to the hawkish end of the Israeli spectrum. This reflects the feelings of its Protestant voters, some of whom are influenced by Christian Zionist thinking. In a British parliamentary debate earlier this year, Ian Paisley junior, son of the DUP’s founder, argued that Israel should not be asked to dismantle settlements unilaterally. “Settlements are a symptom of the conflict in Israel; they are not the cause,” he insisted. According to Steven Jaffe, co-chair of a lobby group called the Northern Ireland Friends of Israel, Ulster Unionists admire Israeli military prowess and what they regard as stoicism in the face of terrorism. In 2014, when the British House of Commons voted on the principle of recognising a Palestinian state, five of the 12 “no” votes came from the DUP. Sinn Fein, the most popular party among Northern Irish Catholics, has a pro-Palestinian tradition which goes back to the 1970s when Palestinian fighters were giving active help to Irish Republican ones. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, recently took the Dublin government to task for failing to recognise the statehood of Palestine or support Palestinian hunger-strikers. Encouragingly, relations between the two conflict zones go beyond name-calling between politicians or street artists. Ever since the 1990s, when peace agreements brought some stability to both places, there has been a steady exchange of visits involving scholars, NGOs and peace activists in search of lessons that might be transferred from one region to the other. In June, for example, a delegation from IPCRI, a peace-minded think-tank based in Jerusalem, reported favourably on a visit to Belfast. Despite the breakdown of the power-sharing administration of Northern Ireland, the visitors were gratefully amazed that in municipal affairs, the DUP and Sinn Fein could rub along pragmatically. “We learned in Belfast that a reconciliation process is possible, albeit long and exhausting,” they reported. Still, when storms blow up in Jerusalem, currents of turbulence reach Belfast, as an incident this summer shows. Last year, a London-based NGO called Forward Thinking managed against the odds to arrange a meeting in Belfast between members of Israel’s ruling Likud party and Sinn Fein. It was controversial: some Palestinians, especially those involved in co-ordinating an international boycott campaign, accused their Irish friends of betrayal. Last month the NGO tried to set up a similar meeting between the two groups, but this time Sinn Fein declined. It said that, although it still believed in “critical engagement with all parties”, it would turn down the invitation as a gesture of protest against the disturbances around Jerusalem’s holy places."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/the-palestinians-need-new-leaders,"Few experiences are more humiliating for Palestinians than plodding through the Israeli checkpoint at Qalandiya, where the West Bank’s administrative headquarters at Ramallah are separated from the Palestinians’ would-be capital in east Jerusalem. Young Israeli conscripts bark orders at middle-aged labourers queuing to cross. Meanwhile the Palestinian workers can hear the roar of Israeli commuters who live in settlements on nearby Palestinian land zooming along a four-lane motorway barred to Palestinians, en route to jobs in Tel Aviv. “The humiliation is a tax I have to pay to feed my six children,” says a day labourer trudging to work in Israel. Seventy-five years after the UN voted to divide Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state, Palestinians are still waiting for one. While Israelis celebrate May 14th 1948 as their day of independence, Palestinians mourn their naqba, or catastrophe, when some 700,000 of them were forced from their homes or just fled. Israel now rules over 7m Palestinians, including those in Israel and in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are internationally regarded as the basis of an independent Palestinian state. Another 7m are strewn across the Arab world and beyond, about half registered as refugees (see map). Palestinians are a slight overall majority in the territories controlled by Israel and in Israel proper. But they are divided over how to build a future. At times statehood has beckoned. In 1993 Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), the Palestinians’ representative body, signed the Oslo accords that provided for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank under a Palestinian National Authority (PA) and an end to Israel’s occupation within five years. It never happened. Israel withdrew its forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but since 1993 it has more than quadrupled the tally of Jewish settlers in the West Bank to over half a million, excluding East Jerusalem. Meanwhile the PA has rotted. Hamas, an armed Palestinian Islamist movement, won a general election in 2005 and set up a separate administration in Gaza, leaving an enfeebled PA to run bits of the West Bank. Jewish settlers there, including Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, have become a menacing power behind Binyamin Netanyahu’s coalition government.  It has withheld tax revenues that fund the PA. Foreign donors, discouraged by corruption within the PA, have cut aid. America’s Congress, viewing the PA as an instrument of terrorism, have long been loth to fund it. The West Bank’s 3.2m Palestinians, by contrast, resent the PA for seeming to acquiesce in Israel’s occupation. The PA’s ailing 87-year-old president, Mahmoud Abbas, and his Fatah party have stifled democracy. Nineteen years into a five-year term, he has repeatedly postponed elections. In 2007 he closed down the parliament. In 2018 he dissolved it. A recent opinion poll said 77% of Palestinians wanted him to resign; four-fifths consider his regime corrupt. The West Bank’s economy has festered. Frustration is rising. A new intifada, or uprising, could erupt. Last year’s West Bank death toll from violence was the highest since the end of the previous deadly intifada in 2004. This year’s rate so far has been higher. Gaza is more hopeless still. “It’s practically a separate state,” says a former head of Israeli intelligence, Tamir Hayman. Israel controls its borders, sea and air space so its 2.2m people feel besieged, as if in an open-air prison. Income per person is less than a third that of the West Bank. Hamas rules with a heavy hand, by decree. It is officially wedded to armed struggle but, since Israel has smashed it whenever it fires too many rockets into the Jewish state, it has practised a measure of restraint. It repeatedly negotiates ceasefires with Israel, including one earlier this month after Islamic Jihad, another armed Islamist faction, fired scores of rockets and mortars to protest against the death of a Palestinian hunger-striker in an Israeli jail. In the past few days Israel’s air force has hit Islamic Jihad targets, killing at least 25 Palestinians. Hamas has been under local pressure to respond but knows that that would provoke an even fiercer, lethal Israeli response. So despair overwhelms Gaza and the West Bank. With no prospect of negotiations and foreign mediation, over 40% of Palestinians favour violence against Israel, according to a poll conducted by Zimam, a Palestinian ngo in Ramallah, and funded by the eu. Nearly 40% say they dislike the main Palestinian parties. Over 70% have lost hope in a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine co-existing side by side. Palestinian support for a two-state deal is highest among Israel’s 1.7m Arab citizens. Their income of $36,500 a head (measured in 2019) is eight times what Palestinian West Bankers earn and 30 times that of Gazans, at the last count. Alone among Palestinians under Israel’s control, they can vote and carry the same passports as Jewish Israelis. An Arab-Israeli party was part of Israel’s previous coalition government.  But the rise of Israel’s far right horrifies Arabs on both sides of Israel’s security barrier (in large stretches it is a six-metre-high concrete wall). Mr Smotrich says there is “no such thing as Palestinians” and has called for “finishing the job”, a euphemism for expelling Arab Israelis.  A growing number of Palestinians in the diaspora, including refugees, are paying less heed to the official PLO leadership under Mr Abbas. Instead they have begun to call for a one-state solution, where Jews and Arabs between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean would live together in a single democratic state—and where Arabs would have a slender overall majority.  Some Palestinians are looking again to regional leaders. Mr Abbas visited Saudi Arabia in April for the first time in years. A Hamas delegation has recently been there after an absence of eight years. The United Arab Emirates, which signed the Abraham accords that normalised relations with Israel in 2020, may be cooling towards it as Mr Netanyahu’s government lurches even further to the right. Meanwhile Mr Abbas’s refusal to appoint a deputy prompts fear of a power struggle within Fatah that could turn violent when he goes.  Opinion polls suggest that the vast majority of Palestinians want a true democracy. Some of the Western donors on whom the Palestinians rely have urged Mr Abbas to hold presidential and parliamentary elections that might bring Gaza and the West Bank back together under a single authority. It could rejuvenate its leadership and legitimise it, in the event of negotiations with Israel. Even Hamas, still ostracised as a terrorist organisation by most Western countries, has told diplomats it would accept a limit to the size of its representation in a new Palestinian parliament and would not bid for the presidency.  Indeed, elections might break the hold of both Hamas and Fatah over Palestinian politics. Opinion polls suggest that over 40% of voters—and a majority in the West Bank—want “none of the above”, preferring a pragmatic leadership to tackle the poverty and corruption currently winked at by what they see as brutal Israeli overlords. For the moment neither model—one state or two—looks remotely feasible. The essential first step before Palestinians can contemplate the distant future is to revive a democratic Palestinian Authority. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2002/09/12/crushing-palestine-is-no-answer,"AP  AN END to the Israeli-Palestinian tragedy stretches out of sight, but every so often there comes a chance which, if snatched, might alleviate today's pain. Each time, this chance is muffed. The hope of a ceasefire, or an opening to a less savage situation, is blown away, usually by some brutal deed. A lull in the violence, encouraging talk of some kind of interim agreement, is smashed, either by a terrorist bomb or by Israel assassinating a militant or raiding the heart of Palestinian territory. Terrorists calculate that they have an interest in maintaining a scary haze of violence. But what about Israel? Some of its leaders, it seems, also doubt that a peaceful respite would be in their best interests. The latest attempt to break out of the cycle of violence and oppression was the “Bethlehem, Gaza first” plan thought up by Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Israel's defence minister. In return for the Palestinians cutting down on violence, the Israeli army would relax its restrictions, first in the two named areas, and then elsewhere. The plan has worked in Bethlehem but has yet to be tried in Gaza, let alone anywhere else.  In reply to continued low-level Palestinian violence in Gaza, Israel has twice within two recent days driven its tanks deep into the territory. The unfortunate Mr Ben-Eliezer is trapped, and undermined, by a commanding combination from above and below. Both his prime minister, Ariel Sharon, and his new chief of staff, Lieut-General Moshe Yaalon, have made it plain that they have no time for his plan. Similarly, this week's call, by Yasser Arafat and his Fatah movement, for an end to killing civilians, received a swift brush-off.  General Yaalon has explained, lucidly and at length, the philosophy behind his determination to keep hammering the Palestinians until he gets their unconditional surrender. He is not a political right-winger, as his predecessor was, yet he believes the Palestinians pose a “cancerous” threat to Israel's very existence: they are not, in his view, fighting to end the occupation but to liquidate Israel itself. Israel, therefore, must go for total victory. The Palestinians must be beaten in an unambiguous way that sears into their obstinate minds that they must never try anything against Israel again.   The army has been given its head: its recent killing of 13 Palestinian civilians in three incidents got a quick military whitewash. Worse, the chief of staff opposes any pre-victory deal from which the Palestinians might scent Israeli weakness. Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, he argues, was a bad mistake that sent the wrong message to Israel's enemies.  Mr Sharon, who defends General Yaalon as “a level-headed person”, seems to share his views. He insists that Israel should concede nothing in the face of terrorism. That sounds reasonable, but all Palestinians, and some Israelis too, have come to believe that one of his main motives in giving the go-ahead to apparently poorly-timed pre-emptive action is to pre-empt a prolonged ceasefire. This, he fears, might evolve into a situation where he was under pressure to make territorial concessions in return for peace. “Oslo doesn't exist, Camp David doesn't exist, neither does Taba,” said Mr Sharon last week, dismissing the agreements, or attempts to get agreement, that were based on the principle of land for peace. Casting out the land-for-peace equation casts out Palestinian hope. General Yaalon's blanket charge that the Palestinians aim to eliminate Israel distorts the goal of a people living under occupation, most of whom are trying only to win back their land. And loss of hope breeds supporters for the terrorists. Last week, a nervous Israeli public saw a car carrying half a tonne of explosives stopped at a road block. This week, Palestinians were arrested for allegedly trying to poison food.  Such acts are despicable, and Israel has to guard itself against them. But the refusal to deal at all, implicit in General Yaalon's perception of the Palestinians as an enemy only to be flattened, leads directly to an open-ended war of attrition."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2005/04/07/life-in-the-armpits-of-palestine,"THESE days, the people of Kfar Qaddum have to come home by the back route, a bumpy dirt track that weaves between sickly-looking olive trees, where cars get stuck when it rains. Three years ago the army closed its link to the main road to Nablus because, for a few hundred metres, it runs through Kedumim, a nearby Israeli settlement. When the village ambulance needs to get to a Nablus hospital, its driver calls Kedumim's security people, who block the roads into Kedumim proper with vehicles before opening the gates at either end of the access road. Three people have died waiting.   When Israel's “security fence” in the West Bank is finished, it will run between Kedumim and Kfar Qaddum, and complete the seal (see map). Though the barrier route, revised in February, now hugs more closely the “green line” (which marked the boundary between Israel and Jordan before the war of 1967) and bites off less Palestinian land, it also extends numerous arms deep into the occupied lands, around the main Jewish settlement blocks. Caught in the armpits are dozens of Palestinian villages, places such as Jinsafut, wrapped in the embrace of the Ariel block. B'Tselem, an Israeli human-rights group, says that 53 communities will be surrounded on at least three sides by the barrier—nearly twice as many as under the previous route. And many other villages, such as Kfar Qaddum, have lost or will lose farmland and access to nearby towns. This is the final tightening of the economic noose imposed by Israeli security measures, which have barely relaxed since the Israeli and Palestinian leaders declared a ceasefire two months ago. Farming remains the only source of income for many Palestinians. The authorities take advantage of the often murky land registry to expropriate land Palestinians say is theirs. Kfar Qaddum says it has lost 5,000 dunams (500 hectares) of its 18,000, and will lose another 5,000 to the barrier. (“Not one centimetre of Kedumim is built on land known for sure to be private,” says Shlomi Khazon, the settlement's security officer.) Closing roads, meanwhile, has effects that range from the obvious, such as deaths in waiting ambulances, to the subtle but insidious. For instance, getting to Nablus by public transport now costs 25 shekels ($5.70) instead of five, says Nasser Akel, Kfar Qaddum's deputy mayor. So the 200 Kfar Qaddum students at university in Nablus now prefer to rent rooms there. But since tradition frowns upon unmarried women living away from home, women will become less likely to study.  The old barrier route called for a loop almost totally encircling the village of Nahallin, south-west of Jerusalem. That loop is gone; but it makes little difference. Nahallin sits right inside the Etzion block of settlements, with only one road out, towards Bethlehem. And on March 20th, the villagers found repossession orders hanging in their fields for nearly 2,000 dunams which the state claims as its own. It is the latest bite of a long series. One chunk, expropriated on security grounds, ended up as settlement real estate. In another case, after a long, thin strip was expropriated for building the (now cancelled) barrier, a much larger chunk behind it, though not officially confiscated, became inaccessible. By coincidence, perhaps, it was also on March 20th that the government confirmed plans to build 3,500 new housing units between Maale Adumim and east Jerusalem, filling a gap in a settlement corridor that cuts across the West Bank.  Israel's plan seems to be two-pronged. First, withdraw the settlers from Gaza. (Last month, Ariel Sharon, the prime minister, won the last battle against the withdrawal in Israel's parliament by defeating a referendum vote and a rebellion against the budget.) Second, surround the main West Bank settlements with the barrier and build so many Jewish homes there that giving them back to any future Palestinian state would be impractical.  America, which last year recognised the need to respect such “facts on the ground”, was caught off guard by the Maale Adumim announcement. Its officials issued conflicting statements. Only this week did George Bush, who is due to meet Mr Sharon next week, urge Israel once again to stop the settlement-building.  The cruel twist is that places like Kfar Qaddum and Nahallin are a low priority not only for Israel but also for the Palestinian Authority (PA). It has been busy with other things: a truce with Palestinian militants, preparations for local and municipal elections and negotiating with Israel over prisoner releases and the handover of security functions in the main West Bank Palestinian towns. “The PA isn't interested in us,” says Mr Akel. “We want it to put our case on the agenda for the negotiations with the Israelis.” But the barrier's most perverse effects are reserved for a handful of villages that have ended up in a legal twilight zone. Though they have been within the municipal boundary of Jerusalem since the eastern part was annexed in 1980, their Arab residents, for historic reasons, hold West Bank identity cards. Nu'aman, a hamlet on Jerusalem's south-eastern edge, is one such place. For years its children went to school in a nearby Jerusalem village, Um Tuba. But during the 1990s the problems began: first no building permits, then no access to the school, then arrests and harassment for villagers caught in Jerusalem without a permit, even though their homes are, officially, in the city. The road north to Um Tuba and Jerusalem was closed. And then, following plans to build the barrier between Nu'aman and the neighbouring Al-Khas, so was the road south to Bethlehem. The villagers petitioned a court to re-route the barrier to leave them on its West Bank side; then, when it became clear that they would lose access to a lot of farmland (their lawyer, Shlomo Lecker, says their claim to the land is shaky), they petitioned instead to get the blue identity cards of Jerusalem residents. Last month Nu'aman won a small victory. A court ruled that the army must give its residents a paved road to Al-Khas and free passage across the barrier until their residency status is sorted out. Meanwhile, they can apply for blue cards. But only those who can prove they have lived there since 1972 will get them, says Mr Lecker. That is, not many. And in any case they will be hemmed in, with the barrier on one side and a planned new district of the nearby Har Homa settlement soon to start sprouting on the hills next door. “Soon, you see,” jokes Jamal Darawi, Nu'aman's informal village head, with only a trace of bitterness, “we will have our independent state: Nu'amanistan!”"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/30/a-vision-for-the-palestinians-after-the-war,"He iS OFTEN mentioned as a possible future leader of the Palestinians. But in a lengthy discussion with The Economist from his home in Abu Dhabi on October 27th Muhammad Dahlan, a former security chief for the Palestinian Authority (PA) from Gaza, denied he wanted the role. In the interview, his first with the Western press since Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, attacked Israel on October 7th, Mr Dahlan did, however, lay out his vision for what should come after the war for Gaza. It was one of surprising hope, amid the horrors of the fighting. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas. Born in an impoverished refugee camp in the south of the Gaza Strip, Mr Dahlan rose through the ranks of Yasser Arafat’s Fatah movement, and spent much of the 1980s in Israeli prisons where he learned to speak fluent Hebrew. He was the Palestinian national security adviser when the PA lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007. He has connections on all sides of the conflict. He has enemies in Fatah—notably among the inner circle of Mahmoud Abbas, the PA’s embattled and ageing president. He was convicted of corruption in absentia by a Palestinian court in 2016. But he has plenty of friends too. And he grew up in the Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza alongside much of the current leadership of Hamas so can talk to the Islamist group. He also speaks warmly of his relations with some senior Israeli figures. Mr Dahlan rubbishes the suggestion that once the war ends any one individual could be shipped in to run Gaza. Instead he suggests a two-year transitional period with an administration run by technocrats in Gaza and the West Bank. That could, he imagines, reunify the Palestinian territories after more than a decade of infighting. After that he envisages parliamentary elections, based on a Palestinian state with, at that point, undefined borders. All Palestinian political factions should be allowed to participate, including Hamas (fears of a Hamas victory have been one of Israel’s main reasons for blocking Palestinian elections in recent years). Even after this war it would be impossible to govern Gaza without its consent, he argues: “Hamas will not disappear.” He believes that Arab states such as Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) could support such a body. This Palestinian state should then be internationally recognised, including by Israel. More immediately Mr Dahlan, who has recently returned from Egypt and has close ties with Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, pours scorn on the idea of allowing refugees into the Sinai peninsula as a way to relieve the crisis in Gaza. “Who is going to take this historical responsibility to be blamed by the Arab population for helping the Israelis to displace the Palestinians?” he says, noting that the mass displacement of Palestinians into Egypt would create serious national-security issues for the government in Cairo. A parliamentary system as envisaged by Mr Dahlan would yield a prime minister to lead the Palestinians. That would mean doing away with the presidency currently filled by Mr Abbas. Mr Dahlan is in favour of such a shift. It is an “illusion” that any one man can solve the Palestinian issue, he insists: “The time of the heroes passed away with Arafat.” Responding to rumours that he may be Israel’s choice to run Gaza after the war, he rejects the suggestion that he would come in to clean up the mess once the fighting ends. And yet he firmly sets out his credentials for leadership; he knows Gaza well and has spent 40 years fighting for the Palestinian cause, but he also claims to know the Israelis. He has become a close adviser to Muhammad bin Zayed, the powerful ruler of Abu Dhabi, in recent years. He claims to have channelled around $50m a year from the UAE into Gaza. He has also built a network of support in the West Bank’s refugee camps. To many, the Palestinian national movement has never looked in worse shape than in the days since Hamas’s attack, and Israel’s retaliation. The long-standing divisions between the leaderships in the West Bank and in Gaza have only worsened, and international backers of the PA have announced reviews of its funding. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and the PA seems weaker than ever. It would be easy to argue that the Palestinians are further away than ever from a state of their own. Yet Mr Dahlan is surprisingly hopeful. He sees an opportunity for the Palestinian cause even in the middle of war. The last month has changed things hugely for the Palestinians, he says. “Three months ago there was zero hope. Who was mentioning the Palestinian cause three months ago? Nobody… Now everybody is talking about our suffering.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/united-states/2008/12/04/subject-israel-palestine," “THE big question is: do you want to end this conflict or just tamp it down? The arguments for the first are self-evident. Palestine fouls up our diplomacy: Israel is thrown at us whenever we ask Muslim allies for help. Unsolved, this conflict generates wars. The last administration was tripped up by the Israel-Hizbullah war in 2006. Another round in Lebanon—or a small war in Gaza, or a big one between Israel and Iran or Syria—is possible at any time.  But the argument for just tamping down is also strong. Presidents who go for the whole package waste their time and fail. Jimmy Carter got peace with Egypt but nothing for the Palestinians. Hillary will tell you Bill spent more time on this than anything else in foreign policy, but he failed too. His excuse is that Arafat suckered him (“Don't you ever trust that son of a bitch,” was his parting advice to Colin Powell), but now that Arafat's dead the Palestinians have two addresses instead of one. The Europeans tell us that Hamas can live with a two-state deal, despite its spiel about destroying Israel. But if we talk to Hamas we knock the legs from under Mahmoud Abbas. For now he's still our Joe and the Palestinians' president. As for Israel, Ehud Olmert was a cooing dove compared to Binyamin Netanyahu, who looks like winning the election in February. He plays annoyingly well on the Hill and pushes the line that Abbas can't deliver and that Hamas is a terror front for Iran (which, by the way, he wants us to bomb).  Even if you decide against going the whole hog, you'll lose nothing by saying forcefully before Israel votes that we want a two-state solution with a shared Jerusalem and little modification of the pre-1967 line. Spell out the percentages. Netanyahu might as well know he won't get another free pass to jerk us around on settlements. Then, honour satisfied, you could decide to put the full package to one side and try something more modest, like peeling Syria from Iran by dangling the Golan Heights. Israel's own security people want a Syria deal.  If you want to get a settlement with the Palestinians too, we must start early and allow time. If Hillary is too grand to shuttle, appoint an envoy reporting to you to (1) make our Arab friends wangle Hamas back into a Palestinian unity government; and (2) get international buy-in to an “Obama plan”. This will in fact consist of the “parameters” Bill Clinton drew up in 2000 and are the nearest you'll get to a sellable compromise. Hillary must help you sell this in New York as well as Riyadh. Only then should you step in to close the deal—after figuring out what mix of heat and reassurance to apply to the Israelis. They're the ones who have to give up something real.”"
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/11/15/despite-its-sympathies-egypt-is-unlikely-to-help-palestinian-refugees,"To read more of The Economist’s data journalism visit our Graphic detail page. THERE IS ONLY one viable way out of Gaza: through Egypt’s border crossing in the south of the enclave. Since the war Egypt’s government has kept it shut to refugees, though it has historically had sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the country’s president, says that opening the border raises the possibility that Palestinians could lose Gaza, and become unable to return. But Egypt has more self-serving motivations, too. A rush of refugees from Gaza could revive the Muslim Brotherhood, the political Islamists who have long been the biggest internal threat to Mr Sisi. The country has also been severely affected by a mass movement of people caused by another conflict in the region (see map). That is putting pressure on Egypt’s fragile economy and making it all the more hostile to the idea of re-homing Palestinians. Amid war in Gaza, the spotlight on a brutal civil war in Sudan has faded. Fighting broke out in April when Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of a rebellious paramilitary group, tried to seize control of the country from General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads the Sudanese Armed Forces. Since then thousands of people have been killed in fighting between the two groups, and more than 6m people have been displaced from their homes—around 1.2m of whom have fled across its borders. In the first three months of fighting, Egypt received the highest number of people fleeing the war. More than 250,000 people sought shelter there, though the real number is probably higher. In greater Cairo the influx reportedly sent rental prices soaring. Resources are scarce elsewhere, too. Due to the government’s poor handling of the economy, annual inflation hovers at 36%. Many Egyptians are struggling to buy food. Public schools—underfunded and overcrowded—rely on support from the United Nations. Egypt’s government cracked down in June on border crossings from Sudan, which has reduced the number of arrivals from 4,000 per day at the beginning of the crisis, to just 400 per week in September. By mid-July Chad had taken in more Sudanese refugees than Egypt (see chart). South Sudan now has too. Were the Rafah crossing opened to Palestinians, the number of new arrivals would probably dwarf those from Sudan. The enclave, home to 2.2m people, is becoming uninhabitable: 12% of the buildings have been damaged, and one in 200 people have been killed. Thousands of Palestinians have already made their way towards the Rafah border in search of food, electricity, water and safety. In the 1950s Egypt treated many Palestinian refugees as equals (though naturalisation remained out of reach for many). Egypt has made clear that those days are long gone.■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/01/18/might-they-want-to-join-palestine,"HARISH might have been Israel’s first city purpose-built for both Arabs and Jews. On the hilltops dividing the Mediterranean coast from the West Bank, bulldozers have been clearing the way to accommodate 60,000 inhabitants. Its first wave of Arab ones has already co-operated with ultra-Orthodox Jews to elect a mayor. And unlike neighbouring Jewish town councils, which went to court to stop Arabs living or burying their dead within their security gates, Harish’s officials portray a future where minarets and synagogues will coexist side by side. Yet if Israel’s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has his way, the city will be wrenched from its predominantly Arab surroundings. When Yigal Shachar, who heads the city’s special planning committee, draws a putative border between the states of Palestine and Israel, he draws a loop around Harish, including its happily integrated Arabs, keeping it firmly in Israel—but draws a new line around a concentration of nearby Arab-Israeli towns such as Ara, putting them into the adjacent West Bank, where the Palestinians hope to build their state. Ten years ago, when Mr Lieberman first proposed moving Arab-populated Israeli towns near the present border into Palestine in exchange for Jewish settlement blocs in the Palestinians’ West Bank being incorporated into Israel, he was branded a racist firebrand. Liberals accused him of promoting the forcible “transfer” plan, akin to ethnic cleansing, proclaimed by a rabbi, Meir Kahane, who vilified Arabs while calling for a pure Jewish state. Today, however, even some doveish Israeli left-wingers find such ideas reasonable. And when Mr Lieberman recently again proposed swapping Jewish-populated lands for Arab ones, not only did Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, stay silent, but American mediators declared that the foreign minister had joined the peace camp of those seeking a two-state solution. “No one will be expelled from his home, or have his property confiscated,” says Mr Lieberman. “We’re just talking about moving the border.” On his Facebook page, he recently mocked Arab parliamentarians who protested against the idea, teasing them as “lovers of Zion” for wanting to stay in Israel. But a recent poll in a liberal Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, found a growing number of Arabs backed it, too. Whereas 80% had decried it five years ago as another stage in the nakba, or catastrophe, as Arabs call their dispossession by Israel in 1948, over a third were now reported to be in favour. Many reasons have been aired. Israel’s policy of letting its Arab, but not its Jewish, citizens holiday and work in the West Bank’s Palestinian cities has strengthened ties between Arabs on both sides of the current border. And some of Israel’s secular Arabs are keen to shed their Islamists, whose wellspring lies in Wadi Ara, part of the area Mr Lieberman wants to swap. But the main reason Israel’s 1.7m Arabs increasingly identify with Palestine is the mounting rejection they face in Israel. Mr Lieberman’s dreams of casting them off and Mr Netanyahu’s drive for global recognition of Israel as a specifically Jewish state are alienating many of the more than 20% of Israelis who are Arabs. This growing sense of ostracism has been reinforced by actions. Israel’s national bus carrier skirts Arab towns while serving Jewish outposts. The government builds industrial zones for Jewish towns but rarely for Arab ones. Though signposts are in Arabic as well as Hebrew, they are often spelt wrong. “We thought we were citizens in a democracy,” says Makbula Nassar, a fiery broadcaster on Radio Shams, an Arabic radio station in Israel. “Despite decades of dispossession, communal violence was minimal. But we discovered that we were always considered the enemy.” An Arab dentist in an Israeli hospital sees his hopes of coexistence wither, as the conflict that was largely about territory turns religious. An Arab lawyer fears her lifetime of trying to integrate into Israel will be worthless. “I’m an expert in Israeli law. How will I practise in Palestine?”"
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/12/a-short-history-of-gaza,"ON OCTOBER 7TH Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip, attacked Israel, killing 1,300 people and taking dozens of hostages. Israel has responded with force: strikes on Gaza had killed around 1,400 Palestinians by October 12th. Residents of the strip, a 360-square-kilometre block of land wedged between Egypt, Israel and the Mediterranean, are no strangers to tragedy. Since 2007 they have suffered a stifling blockade and a series of wars. How has the history of Gaza shaped its people? Palestine, which had been part of the Ottoman Empire for the better part of four centuries, was seized by the British in 1917, during the first world war. That year Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, pledging vague support for a Jewish “homeland” in Palestine. After the war Palestine was administered by Britain, and Zionist immigration, which had begun in the late 19th century, increased. Tensions between Jewish and Arab residents rose and in 1936 the Arabs revolted. By 1939 their uprising had been suppressed—but Britain palmed off the problem to the United Nations, which voted to partition the land. Britain soon withdrew. In 1948 the state of Israel was created. Five Arab countries immediately invaded and Israel triumphed in the nine-month war that followed. About 750,000 Palestinian Arabs were uprooted. Many ended up in the two pockets of land retained by the Arabs: Gaza, controlled by Egypt, and the West Bank, administered by Jordan. Conditions in Gaza were dire: many people slept in barracks, schools and mosques. Refugees in the strip were not allowed to enter Egypt, nor to return to Israel. They were trapped and stateless. In 1967, during a six-day war with Egypt, Jordan and Syria, Israel seized Gaza and the West Bank. Life in Gaza improved little under Israeli occupation. By the mid-1980s about 250,000 Palestinians, 10% of the population of the occupied territories, had been detained or interrogated, says Ian Black in “Enemies and Neighbours: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017”. Israel established Jewish settlements in Gaza, angering Arab residents. In 1987 Palestinians rose up, in what became known as the first intifada, or “shaking off”, a sustained movement of violent protests that lasted years. In 1993 Israel and the Palestinians signed the Oslo peace accords, a five-year interim agreement that was meant to give the Palestinian people the right to self-determination. The Palestinian Authority (PA), a new entity, assumed limited control of Gaza and the West Bank, although the Israeli occupation continued. Negotiators could not agree on the thorniest of issues, such as settlement expansion and who would control Jerusalem, and Hamas, which had emerged during the intifada, embarked on a campaign of suicide-bombings to oppose the accords. The peace process ran aground. In 2000 Palestinians rose up again in the second intifada. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, in part because it was so costly to hold. A year later Hamas won a majority in a Palestinian election and formed a unity government with Fatah, its political rival. In June 2007, after a brief civil war, the militants assumed sole control of Gaza, leaving Fatah to run the PA in the West Bank. In response Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the coastal strip, strangling its economy. Although the Israeli government has issued thousands of work permits in recent years, allowing Palestinians in Gaza to cross the border to earn money, conditions in the strip have improved little. In 2022 the unemployment rate was 47%, and 70% for the young; eight-hour blackouts are a daily occurrence. As well as the blockade, people in Gaza have suffered the consequences of four wars, waged by Hamas and Israel. Between 2008 and 2023, these conflicts and various other outbursts of violence killed 5,360 Palestinians in Gaza and injured 63,000. The latest conflict promises yet more misery. Israel has imposed a “full siege” on the strip, limiting access to fuel, electricity and food. A ground invasion appears imminent. Civilians in Gaza have already suffered much, but the worst may be yet to come. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2015/01/08/see-you-in-court,"THE “nuclear option” was how American and Palestinian officials described the application by Mahmoud Abbas, Palestine’s president, to join the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. His move follows a vote against a Palestinian attempt to have the UN Security Council set a deadline for Israel to end its occupation of territories it captured in 1967. It might open Israel—or Palestine—to charges of committing war crimes. Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the UN, said Palestine would join the court on April 1st. Before Mahmoud Abbas applied on January 1st to join the ICC, Israeli officials promised it would result in an appropriate “Zionist response”: the expansion of settlements that would in effect bisect the West Bank near Jerusalem. Moreover, said officials, an application would also effectively spell the end of talks to establish an independent Palestinian state: never again, they said, would Israel negotiate with Palestinians over the future of Jerusalem, an issue that would have to be the cornerstone of any agreement since both sides claim it as their capital. Given such hyperbole, the response of Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, looks fairly mild. For now he has acted as in past rows, by withholding customs revenues that Israel collects on behalf of the PA on Palestinian imports, a sum of $127 million that comprises two-thirds of Mr Abbas’s monthly budget. Even that act earned Mr Netanyahu copious reprimands. A spokesman for the Obama administration ticked him off. So did Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, the veteran if maverick hardliner from Mr Netanyahu’s own party, Likud, who has turned into Israel’s leading advocate of Israeli-Palestinian coexistence. Threatening Mr Abbas with bankruptcy and the Palestinian Authority (PA) with collapse, Mr Rivlin said, was bad not just for Palestinians, but for Israel too. He has a point. Israel’s retention of tax revenues has left Mr Abbas unable to cover this month’s salaries for 160,000 state employees. The president’s men insist that Mr Abbas’ critics, who always thought the old man was bluffing about joining the ICC, will now cheer rather than stir up the street. But unions representing PA employees are smarting from previous pay cuts. Banks might have the reserves to cover their salaries for only a couple of months. A Palestinian businessman asks: once the money dries up, for how long will PA security forces remain quiet before they start selling their guns to make ends meet? On a previous occasion when that happened in 2006, Hamas’s military wing was a willing buyer of weapons. Shortly thereafter it took over Gaza. Israel’s freeze on tax receipts, therefore, seems likely to be thawed just as previous ones were. Israel is appealing to a sympathetic Congress to withhold the $400m it gives the PA each year when Palestine brings its first petition to the ICC. But Palestinians hope that will not happen. “Will the Americans really topple one of the last secular rulers,” asks a Palestinian official, “while IS is itching to take over next door?” In any case, Saudi Arabia, which has chipped in cash before, sounds more sympathetic than normal. Now that Mr Abbas has followed through, the question is whether the ICC will do much. Israeli officials fret that soldiers travelling abroad may be subject to arrest. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are already said to be paying lawyers in western capitals to prepare the writs. Palestinians and their supporters abroad, meanwhile, hope to seek the prosecution for war crimes of any Israeli accused of occupying Palestinian territories. Among those that could be targeted is Uri Ariel, the settler housing minister who is driving the expansion of settlements on the West Bank. Yet both sides seem to invest the ICC with powers that it has never hitherto shown itself to have. And it could take many years for an investigation to reach conclusion. “Look at Africa,” says a sober Israeli official, in reference to investigations that have stalled in Kenya and Sudan. Just a few days after the Palestinian application, Israel’s Supreme Court (which prides itself on keeping on the right side of international law) prevented the government from building its separation barrier through Battir, a delightful West Bank village set on a gorge through which the old Ottoman railway line to Jerusalem passes. The monks of Cremisan, whose monastery is also threatened by the barrier, wonder whether Israel’s judges will similarly spare their property. If not, they could turn out to be among the first applicants to head for the international court."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/16/to-save-palestinian-lives-in-gaza-open-the-crossing-into-egypt,"The ground war has yet to begin, and already casualties are mounting. Gaza’s 2m people are kettled inside a space that is more densely populated than London. As we write, the count from inside the enclave is over 2,500 killed and almost 10,000 wounded. Because the median age in Gaza is just 18, many of the dead are children. Israel is determined to destroy Hamas. Urban warfare is bloody and intense. Something terrible is about to unfold. That is why, starting with the UN secretary-general, the search is on for ways to save lives—both inside Gaza and by preventing the fighting from spreading to Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, is travelling tirelessly across the region. His boss, Joe Biden, may soon visit Jerusalem. Amid this frenzied diplomacy, governments, aid agencies and Palestinian sympathisers are issuing desperate pleas for Israeli restraint. That aim is noble and just. Unfortunately, calls on Israel to stay its hand are being undermined by well-meant naivety and by double standards. As Mr Blinken is demonstrating, the only realistic path to protecting the innocent lies in hard-headed negotiations, and nowhere more so than over plans to open up the crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Mr Blinken’s first job is to set expectations of well-meaning people. They often assume that killing civilians must always be against international law. However, Hamas terrorists have just demonstrated the gravity of the threat they pose by murdering 1,400 Israelis. In response, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) can lawfully make its country safe by destroying Hamas weapons, fortifications and fighters. Because the land beneath Gaza City is honeycombed by Hamas tunnels, a ground offensive is needed. The awful fact that many civilians will die, even if Israel tries to protect them, is not collective punishment of the Palestinians, but the ugly face of urban warfare. Outsiders are entitled to ask Israel to allow medical supplies, food and water into Gaza. There is room for argument about what counts as proportionate force and whether Israeli warnings to civilians are adequate. In the past, Israeli action has sometimes been excessive because the IDF has wanted to demonstrate that violence does not pay; and in recent days the defence minister has stooped to calling Hamas terrorists “human animals”. All too often, however, when people place demands on Israel’s conduct they betray double standards—because they do not take account of Hamas’s tactic of putting Palestinians in harm’s way. In the 16 years that it has run Gaza, the group has not sought to help people prosper, but to strengthen its grip on power and to recruit and arm its militants. It does not protect Gazans in war, but uses their bodies as living armour. In the past it has exploited mosques, schools and hospitals to stash arms and conceal command posts. On October 13th Israel warned northern Gazans to flee ahead of its invasion. Hamas did not help them evacuate or attempt to win them safe passage to the south by releasing the 199 Israeli hostages it is holding. Instead it tried to manipulate them so that they would stay put in the line of fire. It knows that the toll of dead Palestinian women and children will create an international outcry. How, then, to save innocent lives? Part of the answer is to appeal to Israel’s self-interest. Destroying Hamas would be within the laws of war, but if the cost of obliterating it is the death of many innocent civilians, the harm to Israel’s reputation will rapidly climb. In addition, the bloodier the fighting in Gaza, the more likely Hizbullah will attack in earnest from its bases in Lebanon. Israel does not want a second front. Another part of the answer is to appeal to Israel’s values. Mr Blinken put it well when he echoed the sentiments of his president in Israel at the end of last week. “How Israel does this matters,” he said, standing beside Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. “We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard.” The immediate task is to save lives by persuading Israel to allow Egypt to open the Rafah crossing between Gaza with the Sinai peninsula. The hundreds of thousands of people moving south of the Wadi Gaza, a boundary set by Israel, will need food, shelter and medical aid on a huge scale. Supplies are being stockpiled on the Egyptian side, waiting to be allowed across into Gaza. Talks are focused on letting dual passport holders and aid workers out of Gaza as the aid goes in. A deal here is urgently needed. That is unlikely to be enough. To save as many lives as possible, Egypt should also open the Rafah crossing to Palestinians wanting to flee temporarily from Gaza. It is easy to find reasons to object to such a plan. Palestinians understandably fear that they may never be allowed home. The precedent for that is on display in decades-old “temporary” refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. For its part, Egypt would not like to be seen to connive in emptying Gaza. It also fears that permanent camps could breed Islamist terrorism that aggravate instability in the Sinai, or blow back into the rest of the country. If, years from now, camps become bases for attacking Israel, they might even poison relations between Egypt and Israel, a cornerstone of Middle East security. To guard against all of those things, Israel, America, Egypt and well-meaning Arab states, including those who have signed up to the Abraham accords—and Saudi Arabia, which may one day do so—should make a formal guarantee, underwritten by the United States, that the flight into the Sinai would be temporary. Egypt, which is in economic difficulties, may be more amenable if Arab states were to offer it relief on its debts. America could grease the wheels. We do not underestimate how hard such an initiative would be to pull off. In the old Middle East the very idea would have been unthinkable. But when Hamas started to massacre Israelis, that world was lost. A new Middle East is up for grabs and Iran, Hizbullah, Hamas and the forces of disorder intend to claim it. What better way to deny them than by a joint plan to save Palestinian lives? ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/27/two-states-or-one,"HAVE MORE time and effort ever been devoted to peace to so little effect? America began overseeing talks between the Israelis and Palestinians three decades ago. But the Holy Land remains contested by two peoples who cannot bring themselves to live together. The fighting in May that left 242 Palestinians and ten Israelis dead accomplished nothing except to clear the field for the next round of fighting. The peace process set up in the Oslo accords in 1993 aims to create two states that agree to disagree—using land swaps, security guarantees, a deal to share Jerusalem and a limited “right of return” for Palestinians. Israel’s prize was to be a thriving democracy and a sanctuary for Jews; for Palestinians it was the promise of self-rule. At times, peace has been tantalisingly close, only to recede again amid mutual recrimination. Today, however, instead of being a pathway to peace, the two-state “process” is barring the route. Everyone pretends that peace is still on the agenda when, in reality, it is not. That is a formula for strife. Almost everything that matters can be deferred with the promise that, one day, it will be resolved in a deal that is perpetually over the horizon. It is also a formula that, by default, leads to a single state. The idea that the two-state framework is harmful will not come as news to the Palestinians. Under it, the vision of a viable, contiguous, sovereign Palestine has receded. Palestinian territory in the West Bank is an archipelago in an expanding sea of Israeli settlements that are illegal under international law. Gaza is a solitary island, cut off by an Israeli and Egyptian blockade. The Palestinian Authority was supposed to be a government in waiting. Young Palestinians look on it as the agent of Israel’s occupation, even as they laud Hamas, the violent Islamist group that rules Gaza, for standing up to Israel. In place of the stagnant two-state effort, the new Palestinian vision is to demand individual rights in one state. Those in Gaza and the West Bank resent needing Israel’s permission (often withheld) to travel to see their families. The recent fighting was fuelled by a dispute over property in East Jerusalem, where most Palestinians are mere “residents”. Even Israeli Arabs complain of inequality and rose up during the fighting in Gaza. That leaves Israel in a quandary. It has thrived under Oslo. GDP per head has grown by over half in the past 30 years. Its Iron Dome missile-defence system largely shields it from Hamas’s attacks. A divided, weak Palestinian leadership suits Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who shows little interest in the Palestinians. And it’s not just him: the conflict did not feature much in any of the four elections Israel has held since 2019. This cannot last. The Oslo figleaf lets Israel claim that the occupation will be undone in a final deal. As the interim power in charge, it has no duty to extend full rights to the West Bank. But 54 years after the six-day war, the idea of a temporary occupation rings increasingly hollow. Without hope of an agreement, Israel’s critics have begun to talk of a “one-state reality”. This challenges Israel: as the Holy Land has as many Jews as Palestinians, it cannot remain both Jewish and democratic while permanently controlling all of that territory. Many critics of Israeli policy, including some liberal Jews, now compare the Palestinians’ treatment to apartheid. The Palestinian demand for rights is resonating abroad, not least in the halls of America’s Congress. By allying Israel to the Republican Party, Mr Netanyahu has helped make the Palestinians part of America’s culture wars. Progressives in the Democratic Party have started to declare that Palestinian lives matter. America is Israel’s most important ally. True, American aid matters less than it did and Israel now produces most of its own advanced weapons. It has relations with more countries, including its Arab neighbours through the Abraham accords. Yet if it drifts away from Europe and America and towards countries like Russia, China and populist India, it will be a blow to Israel as a Western, liberal and democratic ideal. More important, Mr Netanyahu’s “anti-solutionism” leaves his country less able than ever to navigate a future with the Palestinians. His embrace of the Jewish far right makes eruptions more likely even as it fires up militant Palestinians—witness the recent communal violence in Israeli cities. The wall that seals off Israel from the West Bank has led to deeper distrust between Arabs and Jews. The settlements, once thought negotiable, have become permanent obstacles to peace. The status quo has served Israel well but is not sustainable. Sooner or later there will be a reckoning that requires a new formula for living next to the Palestinians. Adhering to Oslo while undermining it in practice feeds the reality of one state—because it makes two states harder to realise. Instead of imposing peace in one top-down stroke of diplomatic brilliance, a more realistic aim would be to build it patiently from the bottom up. The guiding principle should be to focus on the human and civil rights of Palestinians. Israel will not grant Palestinians full rights tomorrow. But it can make its Arab citizens more equal by devoting resources to their communities. It could make the administration of Jerusalem more inclusive, so that tiffs over fencing do not escalate into war. It must take more responsibility for the suffering in the West Bank and Gaza—and work harder to alleviate it. A focus on rights also makes Palestinian leaders more accountable. They cannot easily demand rights from Israel that they deny their own people. Mahmoud Abbas is in the 17th year of a four-year term as president. His Fatah party is sclerotic. Hamas tramples the rights of its people, including women and minorities. Better Palestinian leaders are a prerequisite for peace. Abandoning Oslo carries risks, obviously. Unbound, Israeli settlers might push farther into Palestinian territory. Hamas, which wants a single state in which Palestinians would outweigh Jews, might redouble its resistance. But today’s path is even riskier. Peace always starts by acknowledging reality. It takes root by improving lives and renewing politics. That can flourish into something new. Then, one day, the parties can start talking again about a deal, whether of one state or two. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2006/05/04/shut-your-eyes-and-think-of-palestine," ARE Palestine's rival militias heading for civil war? Look, for instance, at the incident in Gaza last week when Fatah militiamen shot their way into the health ministry and would have captured its minister had Hamas's militiamen not rushed to his aid. Under Western and Israeli pressure, and amid mounting lawlessness, what is left of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Gaza seems bent on tearing itself to bits. Or so it appears.  AFP  Hamas ministers under Fatah's eyes But take note of a contrary development: preparations for a national dialogue, leading to a coalition government. The offer of talks was made last week in a letter that Abdel Aziz Dweik, Hamas's American-educated parliamentary speaker, wrote to Mahmoud Abbas. The president, a Fatah man, accepted “in principle”.  Most Palestinian politicians admit that their chances of surviving a tightening international and Israeli siege would be greater if they managed to close ranks. A coalition, many have come to believe, offers mutual benefit. It would give Fatah the chance to regain the hold over the authority that it lost in the elections, and stem Hamas's drive to displace it. A coalition might also reverse the domestic scorn that Fatah earned by smooching with the unholy alliance of outsiders bent on bringing the government down.  For its part, Hamas stands to win some of Fatah's international legitimacy and—of more immediate concern—the money without which it cannot govern. “National unity will enable the Arabs to stand firmly with the Palestinians, and weaken the American iron fist,” said Atif Adwan, a Hamas minister. Moreover, a coalition government would give cabinet ministers the cover and distance they need from the stalwarts who continue to resist the demand by America, Europe, Russia and the United Nations that Hamas recognises Israel's right to exist, honours previous PA agreements and forswears violence.  Ministers struggling to balance both books and dogma have already gone some way to conceding that change is inevitable. “A long-term ceasefire as understood by Hamas and a two-state settlement are the same,” says Omar Abdel Razaq, the finance minister. “It's just a question of vocabulary.” With criticism growing of his handling of the salary crisis, he claims that he would be only too happy to give up his job to Fatah, and return to teaching.  The attempts to bring Fatah on board have so far foundered on the agenda. Fatah has made four conditions: a joint political programme based on recognition of its “peace project”, a resolution of the conflict between Mr Abbas and Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, for control of the PA's institutions, the acceptance of factions other than Fatah in the coalition, and Hamas's inclusion within, and submission to, the authority of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Hamas says it wants to discuss all four, but rejects them as preconditions. A tentative date for talks, pencilled in for the start of May, was delayed until the middle of the month and seems now to have been pushed further ahead. Much can go, and is going, wrong. Muhammad Dahlan, an important Fatah figure in Gaza, declined Mr Abbas's request to join the preparatory team. Mr Abbas himself has not ruled out the prospect of dismissing the government. And some Hamas ministers have yet to abandon the hope that they might run the show alone.  But time is not on Hamas's side. Recent hopes that the Arab League might pay Gulf aid direct to civil servants' bank accounts have been dashed—after the Americans blocked it, says the presidency. And even were it to trickle in, this aid is insufficient to pay March's salaries, let alone April's.  With the economy all but frozen, Palestinians are beginning to tire openly of Hamas's readiness to put pride before prudence. In stark contrast to Hamas's success in the parliamentary elections, Fatah swept the board in last week's student elections at the Open University, the largest Palestinian academic institution. It also did well at elections in the Palestinians' biggest refugee camp, at Baqa in Jordan, hitherto controlled by an Islamist faction.  Some argue that Hamas's waning electoral fortunes are proof that sanctions are working. By their own estimates, Hamas ministers reckon that without sanctions-busting they have but a few months to survive. But their downfall is not a solution. Robbed of power, Hamas has given warning that it will abandon its political experiment—and deny Fatah the mandate to pick up the pieces. The entire PA system—president, Fatah and all—could come tumbling down, and with it all progress towards a peaceful two-state solution. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/02/a-new-type-of-palestinian-militia-is-emerging,"Even by the violent standards of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the night of February 26th was unprecedented. Hundreds of Israeli settlers rampaged through Hawara, a Palestinian town of 7,000 south of Nablus in the West Bank. They were enraged by the shooting dead of two brothers in Hawara earlier that day. For hours they set fire to houses and cars. One Palestinian was killed by gunfire (whose is unclear). For the most part the Israeli army stood by and watched. “They did fire tear-gas at Palestinians who were trying to come and help,” said one Palestinian, surveying the blackened front of his home. The gunman, so far unidentified, who killed the settlers is thought to have links to Lions’ Den, a new armed Palestinian group based in Nablus. It emerged in the aftermath of Israeli raids around the city last year, notably one in which Israeli forces killed Ibrahim Nabulsi, an 18-year-old who had led a then-unnamed group in a series of drive-by shootings at Israeli targets. Lions’ Den has since claimed dozens of attacks in the West Bank, including the killing of an Israeli soldier in October. Support for it is growing. Posters of members killed by Israel plaster the market in Nablus. West Bank shops sell pendants adorned with Nabulsi’s face. The group stands for a new kind of Palestinian militancy. Unlike other militias, the group claims no link to any Palestinian party. It has emerged amid dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority (pa), which calls for non-violent resistance in the face of increasingly deadly Israeli raids, and infighting between Palestinian factions. The group resists the elaborate agendas of Hamas and Fatah, says Mazen Dunbuq, an ex-leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade, a nationalist radical group attached to Fatah. “Their only aim is to resist the occupation.” The Israelis and Palestinians are finding the group hard to handle because of its disparate and dynamic nature. There is no leadership to negotiate with; deals cut with some members may not work for others. “It’s unlikely the Palestinian Authority will conduct any operations against them,” argues Mr Dunbuq. “They are the voice of the Palestinian street and the voice of the people. You can’t go against this stream.” Lions’ Den is feeding off the leadership vacuum in the pa, says Tahani Mustafa, an analyst in the West Bank for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think-tank. “Fatah has become so inclusive it stands for everything and nothing.” Established groups with little local support have lost control, she says. But when Lions’ Den calls for action, people respond. Outsiders are increasingly worried by the rising violence. During the attacks in Hawara, Israeli and Palestinian security delegations were meeting in Jordan, together with American and Egyptian officials, to try to lower tension before Ramadan, which begins later this month. Under pressure from Israel and America, the pa is trying to tame Lions’ Den. It has offered it salaries in exchange for surrendering its weapons. Members wanted by Israel would be offered protective custody in Palestinian jails. A few have agreed. But others have continued to fight.  More Israeli raids on the group look inevitable. But this will stoke radical sentiment, argues Ms Mustafa, not dampen it. And the new government of Binyamin Netanyahu, which relies on far-right and ultrareligious voters, is adding fuel to the fire. Mr Netanyahu did not condemn the settlers’ violence; he simply told them not to take the law into their own hands. Besides, Mr Netanyahu’s coalition includes those who openly side with the arsonists. A parliamentary member of Jewish Power, the party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national-security minister, was on the scene at Hawara. Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, said the town should be “wiped out”. The next day the party boycotted a session in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, instead going to an illegal settler outpost that the army was trying to evacuate, and called for tougher measures against the Palestinians. Mr Netanyahu must get serious, said one party member, “if he doesn’t want to see more events like Hawara.” If and how the prime minister will manage such threats is unclear. ■ "
https://www.economist.com/lexingtons-notebook/2010/08/21/barack-obama-makes-his-push-for-palestine,"I RETURN from holiday just in time to catch a briefing from a senior administration official on Barack Obama's success in at last persuading Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, to start direct talks with Israel's prime minister, ""Bibi"" Netanyahu. There is to be a grand opening in Washington on September 1st, attended by Messrs Abbas and Netanyahu, with Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah acting as chaperones. Talks between Israel and the Palestinians will then ensue, which the administration expects to reach completion, ie, agreement on a final peace settlement, within a year. It is easy to be cynical about the scope of this supposed breakthrough. By getting the two sides back into direct talks Mr Obama has merely returned to where George Bush was after his Annapolis summit of November 2007. Big deal: the direct talks initiated then got nowhere, even though Israel's prime minister at the time, Ehud Olmert, was far readier for territorial compromise than is Mr Netanyahu. Even if, by some miracle, the two men came close to agreement, Hamas is still absent from the table. This means that half of the Palestinian movement would not be party to any deal and will try hard to sabotage one. So indeed will those Israelis in Bibi's governing coalition who for reasons of ideology, security or both vehemently oppose the creation of a Palestinian state. It is better for the parties to be talking than not talking, but a betting man would not favour the chances of a breakthrough to peace. That said, it would be a mistake to put the chances of success entirely at nil. When Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas hit the inevitable impasse, the Americans, who intend to be actively involved in the process through the person of George Mitchell, will doubtless table a bridging proposal. And this is the point at which the script could begin to depart from the precedent Mr Bush set at Annapolis. Mr Bush left his push in Palestine to the end of his presidency, and with the Iraq war to fight never saw the peace process as much more than a distraction or palliative. Mr Obama, on the other hand, started early, and seems determined to persevere despite the pushback he ran into from Israel's friends in Congress after his brutal confrontation with Mr Netanyahu over settlements in the territories. America's president, in short, shows every sign of being a true believer in the necessity of solving this conflict, not least in order to redeem the promises he gave the Muslim world in his famous Cairo speech. A year from now, when the negotiation ""deadline"" expires, he may be approaching the final year of his presidency—but for all the parties in the region know he might still have another four-year term ahead of him. That will make it more expensive for the Israelis or Palestinians to resist whatever bridging ideas America brings to the table. Another point: America's relations with Israel are more than ever focused on the pressing question of Iran and its purported nuclear-weapons programme. The administration has been saying lately that even if the Iranians went hell-for-leather for a bomb right now, it would take them at least a year to build a single device. This suggests that if Mr Netanyahu takes the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran half as seriously as he claims he does, he cannot risk being indifferent, especially over the coming year, to the quality of his relations with the superpower. The administration would surely never express the linkage this crudely, but there is here the making of a grand bargain: greater Israeli flexibility towards the Palestinians in return for ever-closer co-operation against the threat from Iran. As I said, a betting man would not favour the chances of a rapid breakthrough after the Washington summit. The Hamas conundrum is a huge obstacle. But this meeting may turn out to be much more than a reprise of the Annapolis failure. (Photo credit: AFP)"
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2002/04/04/carnage-in-israel-conquest-in-palestine,"AMID carnage and devastation, and before an apprehensive worldwide audience, two old adversaries, both in their 70s, duel bloodily in a showdown that could eventually turn out calamitous for the entire region. Never before has the Israeli-Palestinian conflict looked so dangerous, or so insoluble without dramatic outside intervention.  Long gone are the days when Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat unconvincingly acted out their parts as statesmen, negotiating agreements. Both are now performing in their own true characters. There they are: the extreme Jewish nationalist who believes in Israel's God-given right to fight for wider borders versus a wily old-time resistance leader, prepared to throw lives to the wind to fight for independence against the occupying power.  Israel's prime minister claims that his new assault on Palestinian cities and instruments of government, including Mr Arafat himself, is necessary to defend his country against atrocious acts of Palestinian terrorism. But, beyond this, Mr Sharon has gone to war to obliterate the advances made over the past decade by the Palestinian nationalists he is not prepared to accept. The Palestinian leader, for his part, either cannot or will not stop the suicide-bombers who turn Israel's calm streets into scenes from hell. But, with his back to the wall, Mr Arafat is once again the potent symbol of that Palestinian nationalism that Mr Sharon rejects. There can be no meeting of minds between the two. Mr Sharon has publicly regretted not “eliminating” Mr Arafat when, as Israel's minister of defence, he launched the invasion of Lebanon 20 years ago. But the conflict beween the two grisly old warriors is not personal in the sense, say, of the conflict between Saddam Hussein and George Bush father and son. It is a gargantuan tussle between the two national wills, Israeli and Palestinian, that Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat inadequately embody.  The region has been set on fire by the intifada, the second Palestinian uprising in less than a decade. After these revolts—and the seven years of negotiations that straddled them—Mr Arafat, speaking for all Palestinians, is not going to accept a political process that does not eventually end Israel's military occupation. And Mr Sharon, as one of the main architects of this occupation, is not going to accept any Palestinian leader who refuses to agree to the continuing existence of Jewish settlements, and the other facts born of the 1967 conquest. The result is that for one will to prevail, the other must be vanquished. And since neither has yet been vanquished, the violence soars. Mr Sharon profoundly opposes the Oslo peace process, which is based on Israel living securely beside a Palestinian state that contains most of the West Bank and Gaza. Instead, he sees a solution in a much more limited form of Palestinian autonomy (though he is happy to give this entity the trappings of a “state”) led by docile figures of his imagination.  He could not, when he was elected prime minister a little over a year ago, turn the clock back immediately. Instead he joined the diverse and powerful army of spoilers, led on the Palestinian side by militant Islamists, who have managed between them to sabotage the hopes of a permanent settlement along Oslo lines. The Palestinians are convinced that there can be no hope of a halfway decent political solution so long as Mr Sharon and his ilk are in control. But their leaders have done nothing to help the cause. On the contrary. Mr Arafat's brilliance as a resistance leader, keeping the gleam of Palestinian nationalism alive against all adversities, has been matched by lamentable bungling as chief executive of the Palestinian Authority (PA). He dithered over the intifada, sometimes encouraging it, sometimes trying to check it, more often letting it take its own course. Control slipped from him to the heads of the militia. Now, having helped to bring disaster on his people, he is again the brave resistance leader as Mr Sharon sets out to destroy him. What is now happening looks, feels and smells like war. It involves the largest call-up of Israeli reserve soldiers since the Lebanon war; the invasion and re-conquest of (so far) six of the eight main cities in the West Bank; Mr Arafat held captive in his Ramallah headquarters; skirmishes on Israel's northern borders; Israeli and Palestinian civilians killed in their dozens, by suicide-attacks or by military attacks of great ferocity. Since the second intifada erupted in September 2000, over 1,140 Palestinians and over 400 Israelis have been killed. Of these, 250 Palestinians and 124 Israelis perished last month alone, as Mr Sharon's military solutions moved seamlessly from shelling Palestinian areas to re-invading them, and Palestinian resistance went from guerrilla warfare to suicide-bombings in Israeli cities. AP  Tanks don't knock at the door   The latest and cruellest round in the conflict was triggered on March 27th. A Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up in a hotel in Netanya on the eve of the Jewish Passover holiday, killing 25 Israelis and wounding over 100. It was the worst atrocity carried out inside Israel in the 18 months of the intifada.  Mr Sharon declared his country at war and Mr Arafat an “enemy”, who, “at this stage, will be isolated”. The army was dispatched to invade Ramallah, Mr Arafat's “temporary” West Bank capital, and to enter his compound, besieging him on one floor of his three-storey office block. By candlelight, with his machinegun at his arm, the Palestinian radiated martyrdom.  Israel says the aim of its takeover of cities is to “uproot the terrorists” that have taken sanctuary within them. Palestinians say it is Israel's final assault on what is left of the PA as a prelude to the removal of the leaders themselves. Both are right, because Mr Sharon defines the PA as “a coalition of terror established by Arafat” . The Israeli army is now going after Mr Arafat's inner circle. It is pursuing senior security officials who had previously been considered immune, partly because they have worked closely with the CIA, and partly because some of them had been seen by Israel as pragmatic alternatives to Mr Arafat. The army is also going after Marwan Barghouti, Mr Arafat's top political lieutenant in the West Bank, who is thought by many Palestinians to be a possible future leader. Among the 25 or so Palestinians slain in Ramallah this week were five PA police officers, shot in the head in what Palestinians insist was a summary execution by the Israeli army. And one of the most telling events was Israel's aerial bombardment of the PA's Preventive Security Force (PSF) headquarters to compel the surrender of 200 Palestinians inside it. Until recently, the Palestinian police and the West Bank PSF were probably the only Palestinian security forces not engaged in fighting. The Israelis say that they are searching for, and weeding out, fugitives and terrorists. But, for Palestinians, the killing of their officers and destruction of their institutions is not primarily for this purpose. It is, said Jibril Rajoub, the PSF chief in the West Bank, about ridding from Palestinian consciousness “the symbols of an independent Palestinian state”.  Similarly, the Palestinians claim that the Israeli army's operations inside their cities are about seeking “submission”, not fugitives. For five continuous days Ramallah's 100,000 residents endured a total curfew, often without electricity, food or water; this was briefly lifted at mid-week, only to be reimposed. Offices were shelled, homes ransacked, ambulances shot at, hospitals raided, the dead left unburied, and roads, walls and cars crushed by the marauding, unassailable tanks. Palestinians in Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Jenin and Salfit suffered similar punishment. On April 3rd, an invasion army of some 400 tanks entered Nablus, to be fiercely resisted. Bethlehem is particularly tense, with guerrillas and soldiers fighting house to house and Israeli tanks laying siege to 150 Palestinians who have saught sanctuary in the Church of the Nativity.  The Israelis, on their side, suffer fear. In a response both visceral and calculated, the first five days of the Ramallah curfew saw Palestinian suicide-bombers hit West Jerusalem (twice), Tel Aviv and Haifa, leaving 18 civilians dead and scores injured. Israel is hoping to arrest or kill suicide-terrorists before they can act. But there is little that it can do to catch a Palestinian who wants to die wreaking havoc: not when, like Ayat Akhras from Bethlehem, she is 18, looks European and speaks Hebrew. She detonated herself in a West Jerusalem supermarket on March 29th, taking two Israelis with her. The streets of West Jerusalem are today as deserted and forlorn as those of East Jerusalem, its occupied sister. Few people leave their homes. And all are afraid. Is there any way of descending down this ladder of carnage and conquest? The Palestinian leaders' insistent demand is for international intervention. The gut reflex of most Israelis is for total separation, based on defensible borders. There is just one thought making the rounds that might satisfy both demands. Advocated by some Israeli politicians, and by some Palestinian intellectuals, it calls for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from all of Gaza and most of the West Bank, and for an international force “led by the Americans” to act as a buffer between the two peoples. The withdrawal would be deep enough to convince most Palestinians that one day they will be free. The buffer would be wide enough to give most Israelis the personal security they crave. Neither leadership would accept it. The Israeli government would say that any withdrawal would be “a victory for terrorism”. The Palestinian leaders say that an interim deal would be a defeat for a struggle that is to end “with independence and with that only”. But a majority of both peoples—weary, bloodied and scared—might welcome such an initiative."
https://www.economist.com/newsbook/2011/05/20/the-view-from-palestine,"FOR would-be Palestinian negotiators, there was much in Barack Obama's speech on the Middle East to applaud. For the first time an American president has articulated his country's commitment to two states based on the 1967 borders. He also called for a ""full and phased withdrawal of military forces""—ruling out a permanent military presence, though leaving open the possibility of a long-term interim one. He said a Palestinian state would border Jordan, thereby quashing any lingering Israeli demands that Israel retain a buffer in the Jordan Valley. To Israel's chagrin he also proposed that the parties first resolve their security arrangements and define their borders, before tackling what he called ""wrenching and emotional issues remain: the future of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian refugees"". Israeli officials have long preferred that nothing should be resolved until everything was resolved. ""We're pleased,"" says a Palestinian negotiator, who had days earlier been told that Mr Obama's speech would make only scant reference to Israel. There were, of course, some discomforting passages for Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. Mr Obama scoffed at his plan to secure recognition for a Palestinian state at the United Nations, warning him that it would be simply ""symbolic"". He made it clear that he would not again seek an Israeli settlement freeze as a precondition for kick-starting negotiations. He recognised Israel as a Jewish state, rather than one of all its citizens, Arab and Jewish alike. But the Palestinians have heard all this before. There was as much delight in what Mr Obama did not say. His failure to mention his meeting in Washington next week with Binyamin Netanyahu was seen by Palestinians as a snub to the Israeli prime minister. He abandoned his predecessor's commitment to allowing Israel to keep its West Bank settlement ""blocks""; instead he said land swaps should be mutually agreed. And he pointedly dropped any reference to the three conditions (the abrogation of violence, recognition of Israel, and respect of previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements) that America and its fellow Quartet members had set out five years ago for Hamas, the Islamist group that governs Gaza, as a price for engagement. Instead he said merely that Hamas's non-recognition of Israel raised questions. In short, says an intrigued international official in Jerusalem, this is the most pro-Palestinian speech ever by an American president. But is it too late for more negotiations mediated by America? Since the expiry of Israel's moratorium on settlement building last September, and the resulting collapse of a brief round of negotiations, the Palestinian leadership has distanced itself from reliance on American brokerage. The Arab spring has further increased pressure on Mr Abbas to bow to popular appeals for intra-Palestinian reconciliation and the unilateral pursuit of Palestinian core demands. In September, Mr Abbas plans to seek endorsement of a Palestinian state at the UN. To Mr Netanyahu's dismay, he has also agreed to heal the rift between the nationalist Fatah faction, which he heads in the West Bank, and its Islamist rivals, Hamas. On May 15th Palestinians refugees launched with his blessing a campaign of civil resistance aimed at encouraging the return of Palestinian refugees by breaching Israel's armistice lines. Palestinian officials still hope they can satisfy both their people and their external bankrollers. While agreeing in principle to restart negotiations, they plan to throw the ball back into Israel's court by demanding Mr Netanyahu accept previous agreements to suspend settlement building and agree terms of reference. Should Mr Netanyahu balk, as he is expected to do, Mr Abbas could then head back to the UN. But bucking the momentum for negotiations could prove easier said than done. Palestinian negotiators seeking to pocket Mr Obama's new parameters could come under pressure to suspend their unilateral measures. Mr Abbas would probably be accused of bad faith were he to accept the offer of borders along the 1967 lines but start a campaign to isolate Israel at the UN while efforts to resume negotiations were afoot. In an effort to woo Israel, he might also come under pressure to backpedal on his rapprochement with Hamas. (Mr Abbas had already delayed implementing his reconciliation deal with Hamas until after the Obama speech.) Similarly, he might also be pressed to rein in Palestinian civil resistance.  Fearing as much, some Hamas officials have already denounced Mr Obama's proposals as futile. They accuse the president of double standards—blessing popular uprisings, even armed ones, as struggles for freedom elsewhere in the Arab world, while condemning Palestinians for unilateralism. They rebuked their own, including Khaled Meshaal, the movement's Syria-based leader, for endorsing negotiations with Israel, have been pilloried by rivals within. After two decades of inconclusive negotiations overseen by America, Mr Obama will have an uphill struggle convincing Palestinians that their quest for statehood still goes via Washington, rather than acts of self-determination on the ground or the UN plaza in New York."
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/10/11/the-palestinian-cause-has-been-damaged-by-factionalism-argues-a-former-prime-minister,"THE HAMAS-LED attack on Israel was a case of the expected happening unexpectedly, and on an unprecedented scale. The preplanning was obvious, and the execution not only caught Israel off guard but disoriented it in ways it had arguably never experienced in the long history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. With Hamas eager to own the operation, much of the analysis has so far focused on its possible motives. To be sure, Hamas is a political movement, and speculation about its political motives and aspirations is understandable. But underlying its decision to escalate are a host of grievances, and not taking these seriously threatens to lead to much more disastrous consequences than have been seen so far. Those and other grievances are not felt by Hamas alone; they are legitimate, widely held Palestinian grievances. For who, among Palestinians, can be expected to be indifferent to the hardship and indignity of living under a highly capricious and oppressive occupation that has only been getting more deeply entrenched under the heavy weight of Israel’s expansionist colonial enterprise? In addition to the rapid intensification in the de facto annexation of the West Bank since the beginning of this year, there has been a substantial rise in violence by Israeli settlers and acts of outright terrorism against Palestinian civilians, as well as unprecedented hate speech by Israeli officials. Worse, much of that went largely unpunished. Nor did it lead to any meaningful adverse consequences for Israel internationally. As for Gaza—the tiny enclave that is home to 2.2m Palestinians—the talk about improving living conditions there after each of the previous five rounds of military escalation since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 merely ended up being largely that. More generally, Palestinians, not only in the West Bank and Gaza but throughout the world, have all but given up on the promise of statehood they thought might come with the so-called peace process three decades ago. This disillusionment has been reinforced by the normalisation agreements Israel concluded with four Arab countries in 2020, as well as by the growing realisation that the impending normalisation agreement with Saudi Arabia was virtually certain not to include a Palestinian component of any political significance. Add to that recent Israeli efforts to undermine status-quo understandings on the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem. This has fuelled Palestinian concern that the compound could be split up or, worse, damaged or destroyed. Given the sensitivity of this issue, not only to Palestinians but to Arabs and Muslims throughout the world, it is hardly surprising that Hamas dubbed its October 7th operation “the Al-Aqsa Hurricane”. All of which suggests that the objective Israel has now declared, of destroying Hamas, is unlikely to eliminate the possibility of future instability and conflict. As a political movement, with the ideology and the ideas it stands on, Hamas cannot be destroyed. Thus, Israel’s intention to turn Gaza into a “deserted island”, with all that would entail by way of doubling down on bombardment, not to mention a land operation, is likely to lead only to thousands more casualties, and to destruction, misery and displacement of untold proportions. This is not to mention the distinct possibility that such retaliation leads to further escalation and the eruption of a region-wide conflict. If the consensus is that Israel suffered a major intelligence and security failure last Saturday, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has been, arguably for decades now, suffering from a major doctrinal failure. The policymaking body, which is supposed to be the umbrella for all Palestinian groups and is considered the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, has made virtually no adjustments, either to its political platform or to its membership. Notably, the PLO’s gamble in 1993, based on the promise of the Oslo accords to deliver Palestinian statehood, has clearly failed. Yet the PLO still adheres to and stands on the same political platform as it did back then. Even more anomalous is the continued absence from the PLO of Palestinian factions, like Hamas, that from the very beginning opposed the “peace process”. Equally significant, the PLO’s platform has been steadily falling out of favour with the Palestinian public, who increasingly see it as irrelevant. It is time for Palestinians to adopt a new political platform, and to take concrete steps to bring non-PLO factions into the process. Membership of the PLO’s executive committee should also be expanded to include full and effective representation for political forces that don’t support or engage with its current approach. What principles should underpin the new platform? In short, it should commit itself to either of two (mutually exclusive) options. The first is a single state, with full equality for all citizens enshrined in the constitution, outlawing any discrimination on any basis whatsoever. The second is a negotiated two-state solution, but only with a fully sovereign Palestinian state on all of the territory occupied by Israel in 1967, including East Jerusalem. For this to work, the peace process would have to be preceded by recognition by Israel and the international community of the Palestinians’ right to such a state and, under international law, the right of return and to self-determination. At various junctures over the past decade, Hamas may have been open to considering such a scenario. Is it still a viable path forward? The only way to find out is not through yet another futile convening of a meeting of the heads of Palestinian factions that deals only in generalities and achieves little—as was the case when they last met a few months ago in Egypt—but rather by seeking to forge agreement among the factions, Hamas included, on such principles as those outlined above as a basis for achieving national unity. It has never been more important to find a way to end the division and fragmentation that has plagued the Palestinian polity since Hamas seized power in Gaza 16 years ago.■ Salam Fayyad is a former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority.

https://www.economist.com/leaders/2011/09/24/yes-to-palestinian-statehood,"THE Palestinians are edging closer to getting a recognised state, at least on paper. Their application to the UN's Security Council, pencilled in for September 23rd, will be rebuffed by an American veto. But if they then go to the UN General Assembly, which seems likely sooner or later, the Palestinians will win an overwhelming majority. The “observer” status that would be given to them would be similar to that of the Vatican—a position short of full membership, which can be conferred only by the Security Council. It would not make an immediate difference on the ground but would help the Palestinians on their way to the real thing by giving them a diplomatic fillip. It should be encouraged, for reasons of both principle and practice. The principle is simple: the Palestinians deserve a state, just as the Israelis do. The United States, the European Union and the Israeli government have all endorsed a two-state solution. There is broad agreement that the boundary should be based on the pre-1967 one, with land swaps allowing Israel to keep its biggest settlements close to the line, in return for the Palestinians gaining land elsewhere; Jerusalem should be shared; and the Palestinians should give up their claimed right of return to Israel proper. That still leaves much room for negotiation. But provided that the Palestinian request at the UN, still unfiled as The Economist went to press, does not undermine the basic terms of this deal, it is hard to see why any peacemaker, including America's Barack Obama, should oppose a proposal that nudges Palestine closer to real statehood (see article). The practical and procedural politics of the UN is trickier, but unless the last-minute negotiations deliver something dramatic, the arguments in favour of at least securing the Vatican option surely outweigh stasis. Israel's government, led by Binyamin Netanyahu, and his backers abroad, especially in the United States Congress, insist that Palestinian statehood is premature: instead of going to the UN, the Palestinians should return to the negotiating table without tiresome preconditions, such as demanding a freeze on the building of Jewish settlements. Mr Obama, keen to reassert his pro-Israel credentials before next year's election, seems likely to oppose even the Vatican option. Some congressmen are now preparing bills that would punish the Palestinians for their temerity. This is barmy. The argument that the Palestinians must resume negotiations before getting statehood is specious. Why on earth should a change in status at the UN stop people talking? Besides, the negotiations have been going nowhere—and Mr Netanyahu has been the biggest stumbling-block. Since his grudging acceptance two years ago of the two-state principle, Israel's prime minister has shown no eagerness or flexibility in his purported pursuit of a deal. Settlement-building on the West Bank, which he has refused to stop (barring a partial nine-month freeze), is no mere side issue; the Palestinians accurately liken it to the spectacle of two people negotiating over how to share a pizza while one of them continues to eat it. (Unlike the UN status, this does change things on the ground.) In his speech to Congress in May Mr Netanyahu refused to accept that Jerusalem, whose eastern Arab-populated part the Palestinians see as their capital, should be shared. He even inveighed against the notion that negotiations over the boundary should be on the basis of the pre-1967 line with swaps. The Palestinians have hardly been faultless. Mahmoud Abbas, their leader, has often dithered. He muffed a half-chance for a deal with Mr Netanyahu's predecessor, Ehud Olmert, three years ago. But he is the most peace-minded Palestinian leader the Israelis are likely to get. Were he now to back away from his UN bid, his clout among his own people would shrivel. The more extreme Palestinians, in particular the Islamists of Hamas, oppose the UN bid precisely because it would, if successful, strengthen the hand of their more flexible compatriots. If a UN resolution reaffirmed support for two states broadly along the 1967 border, those who reject Israel's existence, calling for a single state on all the land encompassing Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, would be wrong-footed. This is not to give Mr Abbas carte blanche. He should see whether the Europeans can produce anything (see Charlemagne). Assuming that his bid for full UN membership is blocked, he should rapidly revert to the Vatican option, along with a bevy of provisos to reassure the Israelis. He should agree to refrain from trying to arraign Israel in the International Criminal Court for its past actions. And at some point, Mr Abbas must admit to his people that most of the refugees will never return to Israel proper: that is the price of partition. A more secure Israel amid the Arab spring In truth, Israel will be safer when a proper Palestinian state has been consolidated. That is a point that too few Israelis and their American supporters appreciate. This newspaper has argued steadfastly for the right of Israel to exist. We abhor the creeping delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel. But we also believe that the Palestinians deserve a state of their own. These two beliefs are entirely compatible. By his intransigence Mr Netanyahu has played into the hands of those who would destroy Israel. In blocking any Palestinian aspirations at the UN, America is helping extremists on both sides."
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/10/10/the-crisis-shows-the-failure-of-israeli-policy-towards-palestinians-says-shlomo-brom,"Israel is facing an unprecedented crisis. The state that was founded to protect Jews from persecution failed miserably in protecting its citizens living near the Gaza Strip. It was completely surprised by a militarily inferior adversary. The small Israel Defence Forces (IDF) contingent deployed along Israel’s border with Gaza crumbled and could not prevent the butchering of almost a thousand people, most of them civilians, and the taking as hostages of scores of other citizens by Palestinian terrorists from Hamas. Nobody knows how the situation will develop. The fighting has only just started. The IDF is reorganising its forces along the border and mopping up Hamas forces that crossed from Gaza into Israeli territory. At the same time it is bombing targets in Gaza linked to Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group. The aim is to destroy their military capabilities and to make them pay a high cost for the recent atrocities without recourse to ground operations. Israel’s civilian population, meanwhile, fears further rocket attacks from the Palestinian organisations after a barrage at the weekend and more strikes on Monday. Read more on this story:After its brutal attack, Hamas is calculating its next moveHamas’s carnage upends Joe Biden’s plans for the Middle EastThe lessons from Hamas’s assault on IsraelIsraeli hostages now face a terrifying ordeal This is the usual pattern of Israeli reaction to attacks from the Gaza Strip, but this time it will not be enough. Public frustration and anger are at unprecedented levels. Many accuse the government and the armed forces of negligence and betrayal of their duties, and are demanding drastic military action that will “once and for all” end the threat from the Palestinians in Gaza. The government is unlikely to be able to absorb this pressure without launching major operations in the Gaza Strip that include an extensive ground offensive. These might even lead to reoccupation of the territory, with all the costs in human life that implies. That, in turn, could drag Israel into a wider conflict with the so-called “axis of resistance” that includes not only the Gaza-based groups but also Hizbullah, a Lebanon-based militia, Iran and Syria. The political implications are broad, too. Israel’s government is in a fragile situation. There are demands for resignations of senior officials. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and his government might be “saved” by elements in the opposition that wish to form a unity government with him for the purpose of dealing with this crisis. Regardless of the level of opposition support in the short term, however, the crisis may deal a fatal blow to Mr Netanyahu’s political career as public calls for accountability grow. Israel was led to this grim situation by the failure of its policies towards the Palestinians. When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, two years after the IDF had pulled its forces out, the Israeli government faced a choice between two viable political and military strategies. The first involved adapting to a reality in which Hamas was one of the two major political factions in the Palestinian territories—the other being Fatah, based in the West Bank. Any Israeli government that genuinely wished to end the conflict with the Palestinians would then have striven to include Hamas in the bilateral political process alongside its Fatah rivals. That would have required Israel to enter into direct talks with Hamas while supporting reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. The other option was to adopt a strategy of consistently weakening Hamas and strengthening the Palestinian Authority run by Fatah. That would have had to include a credible political process aimed at a permanent status agreement, possibly achieved through a series of smaller agreements and unilateral steps. These two options had their weaknesses and potential costs, but since the end of the government led by Ehud Olmert, in 2009, successive Israeli administrations have chosen neither of them. Mr Olmert had tried the second strategy for some time but was forced to resign before achieving any of his goals. Mr Netanyahu subsequently adopted a third strategy that was bound to fail. In 2009 Mr Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he declared his acceptance of a Palestinian state with several conditions. Despite this, he abandoned the political process with the Palestinians, eventually making it clear that he opposed the establishment of a Palestinian state. He replaced the political process with a strategy of “divide-and-conquer”, which was aimed at weakening the Palestinian government in Ramallah on the West Bank and strengthening Hamas’s hold on power in the Gaza Strip. Mr Netanyahu believed this to be the best way to ensure that no viable political process would be possible. The prime minister took this policy to a new level in building his current government: a coalition with extreme religious, ultra-nationalistic parties, which stated quite openly that Israel would never enable the establishment of a Palestinian state, give equal rights to the Palestinians under a one-state solution or stop the plundering of their lands through settlement-building. This policy led to most of the Israeli army being deployed to protect Jewish settlers in the West Bank, at the expense of protecting the border around the Gaza Strip. The current crisis demonstrates the utter failure of this strategy. It is absurd to hope that Israel can indefinitely contain with its military might and security services millions of Palestinians who claim the right to self-determination and a free, normal life. Eventually the oppressed will rise against their oppressor. Suffering under oppression and a strong desire for freedom breed resourcefulness. The Hamas fighters who planned last weekend’s attack were indeed very resourceful in exploiting Israel’s unpreparedness. Eventually, Israel will have to make a choice between the two-state solution and a single state with equal rights for all of its inhabitants—and strive to make whichever it chooses work. Hopefully the Israeli public, having endured the collapse of the current approach, will support it. ■ Shlomo Brom is a retired brigadier-general who served in various intelligence posts in the Israel Defence Forces and as a deputy to Israel’s national security adviser.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/01/is-a-two-state-solution-possible-after-the-gaza-war,"In trying to plan for the future, world leaders are looking to the past. “When this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next, and in our view it has to be a two-state solution,” said Joe Biden, America’s president, in one of his many public statements about the nearly month-long war in Gaza. Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, has made similar comments; so has Emmanuel Macron, the French president. An emergency meeting of the Arab League last month ended with a call for “serious negotiations” towards a two-state solution. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas When Israel left Gaza in 2005, uprooting some 8,000 Jewish settlers from a territory it had controlled since 1967, no one knew quite what to make of the decision. Some hoped that Israel’s willingness to cede occupied territory would be a trend, a step towards a final settlement with the Palestinians. Others saw a canny ploy: relinquishing control of Gaza might help Israel entrench its control of the West Bank. The latter view turned out to be correct. Similar confusion has emerged since October 7th, when Israel began planning a ground invasion of Gaza after Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls the territory, massacred 1,400 Israelis. Palestinians fear the war will lead to a second naqba (“catastrophe”), referring to the mass displacement that accompanied Israel’s birth in 1948. Far-right Israeli ministers hope it will offer a chance to reassert control over Gaza and rebuild the dismantled Jewish settlements. A few hopeful sorts, among them Mr Biden, hope it will provide a chance to revive the comatose Israeli-Palestinian peace process. For now, that is a far-off dream: Israeli generals expect months of fighting. But both they and many foreign powers hope eventually to transfer control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority (pa), which governs parts of the West Bank, probably with a peacekeeping force brought in to help the transition. And they doubt that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, would return to Gaza without a guarantee of meaningful talks about Palestinian statehood. Any plan for the “day after” in Gaza, in other words, needs to consider the possibility of a two-state solution. The broad outline has not changed much for decades. A Palestinian state would be formed in Gaza and the West Bank; Israel would swap chunks of its territory for portions of the West Bank where it has built large settlements. Jerusalem would be divided, with some sort of joint control over the old city. A small number of Palestinian refugees could return to Israel, while the rest would settle in either Palestine or their present homes elsewhere. Israel would expect a Palestinian state to be demilitarised. After two decades of serious talks—from the hopeful era of the Oslo accords in the early 1990s, through a desultory attempt under Barack Obama—the peace process ground to a halt in 2014. There have been no serious negotiations since. Negotiators cannot quite pick up where they left off. At the end of 2021 there were 465,400 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank, up from 116,300 when the Oslo accords were signed in 1993. They are a growing obstacle to peace. Most are concentrated in areas that would probably be ceded to Israel in an agreement, but their political clout (they would oppose surrendering even land that they do not live on) has increased along with their population. The regional picture is also more complicated. In 2002 the Arab League endorsed a Saudi proposal that promised Israel normal relations with Arab countries after a two-state solution: by ending its conflict with the Palestinians, Israel could end all its regional conflicts. The Arab Peace Initiative was meant to be a powerful inducement. Israel might be more willing to take its boot off the Palestinians if it felt that other threats would then dissipate. But the region has changed since 2002. Some militias, from Hizbullah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen, are now more powerful than the states they call home. It would not suffice for Arab governments to end their conflicts with Israel: non-state actors would have to agree to do so as well. Other things could be easier. A two-state solution would be costly. Even before the war, the Palestinians would have expected help to rehabilitate Gaza; the bill will be much higher now. At the failed Camp David summit in 2000 negotiators discussed a $30bn fund to compensate Palestinian refugees for lost property. Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (uae), which have boosted ties with Israel in recent years, might be more willing to stump up the cash to show they have not abandoned the Palestinians. The biggest problem, however, remains not the details of a solution but the political will to negotiate and implement one. There will be no serious peace process with Binyamin Netanyahu’s coalition of far-right and religious politicians. That coalition is unlikely to survive long after the Gaza war, and Mr Netanyahu’s opponents hope that the next government will be more amenable to talks with the Palestinians. “We learned a lesson that we need to separate from them in a good way,” says one centrist Israeli lawmaker. “It’s time to start that discussion.” But Israeli politicians from the centre and left have avoided the issue in public for more than a decade. On the Palestinian side, Hamas has always been eager to play spoiler. Its first suicide-bombings in the 1990s helped to scuttle the Oslo process, and the carnage it wrought during the second intifada (“uprising”) from 2000 to 2005 turned a generation of Israelis against the idea of compromise. Perhaps Hamas will fade away after the war in Gaza—but another group could take its place. Ordinary people on both sides have lost faith in the two-state solution. A poll in September 2022 by the Israel Democracy Institute, a non-partisan think-tank, found that only 32% of Israeli Jews would support one, down from 47% five years earlier. Israeli Arabs, who make up one-fifth of the population, still endorsed the idea, although their support has also dropped, from 87% in 2017 to 71% in 2022. A plurality of Israeli Jews preferred the status quo. Support has plummeted even further among Palestinians. A survey in June 2023 by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research found that just 28% still support a two-state solution. Some 53% of them backed the idea ten years ago, though just 39% thought it feasible. Optimists hope that these results are squishy: people are unlikely to support something they think impossible. A meaningful peace process could push the poll numbers back up. “I don’t think our people would reject a chance to end the occupation,” says one former Palestinian minister. But the events of recent weeks could just as well harden both sides against the idea of compromise. As ever in Israel, some of the strongest supporters of ending the occupation are the men tasked with running it. In the wake of the Hamas attack, few Israelis are talking publicly about the two-state solution—or any other solution for the conflict. But defence officials are discussing it in closed rooms. That is partly because the desired end state of the war will shape the war itself and because the Netanyahu government is incapable of holding a serious debate on Israel’s long-term strategy. Then there is the question of who will play mediator. Though Russia and China both aspire to a role in Middle East peacemaking, neither has much leverage or credibility to assume it. The European Union could position itself as an honest broker but it is not taken seriously. That leaves America. Mr Biden spent the first three years of his presidency trying to ignore the conflict. He will have other things on his mind in 2024—and neither Israelis nor Palestinians are likely to embark on a peace process with a president who could soon be turfed out. If Mr Biden wins in 2024, he could try to lead efforts. Donald Trump would be another story. In January 2020, after years of trailing a supposedly serious peace plan devised by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, he finally unveiled it. The plan, almost laughably biased in favour of Israel, was dead on arrival. It would have given the Palestinians just 75% of the occupied West Bank, in three cantons linked by highways. Israel would have kept the Jordan valley, the breadbasket of the territory, and compensated the Palestinians for their loss by ceding a few patches of barren desert in the Negev. Palestine’s capital would have been limited to a few destitute suburbs of east Jerusalem. The Palestinians, unsurprisingly, refused even to discuss the proposal. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/05/27/how-the-israeli-palestinian-peace-process-is-failing,"BY THE STANDARDS of the peace process, if not international law, Oranit is not a terribly contentious Jewish settlement. The Palestinians previously accepted that this hilly town of low-slung homes in the occupied West Bank would remain part of Israel in a future two-state solution. In one negotiating session their disagreements amounted to an area of about 400 square metres. It has grown into a commuter town, half an hour by motorway from Tel Aviv, and rates nine out of ten on Israel’s “socioeconomic index”, a measure of education, wealth and employment. Look east across the sun-baked hills and one sees Azzun Atmeh, an impoverished Palestinian village. No easy commutes for its residents: it is almost fully encircled by settlements and the imposing separation barrier. This is theoretically part of a future Palestine, but right now it is Israel, with most of its land designated as “Area C”, where Israel holds civil and military jurisdiction. The question of how to divide this land has been more or less answered, yet the parcelling out to two states has not come. Instead it remains under Israel’s control—a single state in which Jewish Israelis and West Bank Palestinians living a stone’s throw from each other hold very different rights and face very different prospects. Almost three decades have passed since Yasser Arafat, the late Palestinian leader, and Yitzhak Rabin, Israel’s prime minister at the time, shook hands on the White House lawn in 1993 after signing the Oslo accords. That hopeful moment cemented a formal peace process that would create a Palestinian state and end half a century of conflict. It was meant to happen within five years. Hope, alas, gave way to despair. It has now been more than five years since the parties even sat down to talk. Each time there is a bout of bloodletting between Israelis and Palestinians, it is de rigueur to urge them back to the negotiating table. But such rhetoric obscures why the peace process has failed. Decades of meetings produced a mountain of maps and policy papers. The outline of a two-state solution is well known to all. The problem with the peace process is not a lack of process, it is that process became a substitute for peace. To continue that process in hope of a breakthrough is to indulge a fantasy. It pretends that conditions on the ground—the steady growth of Israeli settlements, Israel’s ever-more entrenched control of Jerusalem, the schism between the West Bank and Gaza—are merely obstacles to negotiate around rather than insurmountable roadblocks. And it ignores shifts in politics and public opinion. Most Palestinians and a plurality of Israeli Jews oppose the two-state solution, as do two of the three governments between the river and the sea. It is time to admit the land-for-peace paradigm has failed. Moreover, it has often been unhelpful and counterproductive. The theoretical existence of a peace process gave Israel cover to entrench an occupation that looks permanent, and contributed to the rot in Palestinian politics. What exists today, and will exist for the foreseeable future, is really just one state. The Palestinian Authority (PA), the self-governing edifice set up after the Oslo accords, was meant to exist “for a transitional period not exceeding five years”. That deadline came and went, but the parties came close to a deal in 2000 at the Camp David summit, two weeks of sequestered talks between Ehud Barak, then the prime minister of Israel, and Mr Arafat. Conventional wisdom at the time blamed the latter for walking away; subsequent assessments offered a more muddled picture. Regardless, the failure at Camp David gave way to the brutal second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which soured many Israelis on making peace. Still, more negotiations followed: the “road map for peace”, the summits at Taba and Annapolis and Sharm el-Sheikh. For the past decade these efforts have been listless. Barack Obama’s two attempts at peacemaking lacked even memorable names. The second segued into a brutal 51-day war between Israel and Hamas, the violent Islamist group that rules Gaza. There have been no direct talks since 2014. Donald Trump’s “deal of the century” was a curious effort to solve the conflict without input from Palestinians. His successor, Joe Biden, seems disinclined even to try. He played at best a secondary role in broking a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel when they fought earlier this month. Then he dispatched Antony Blinken, his secretary of state, for a round of talks. The focus was to be aid for Gaza. The peace process was not on the agenda. In 1968 one of Mr Blinken’s predecessors, Dean Rusk, sent a sharp memo to the Israeli embassy in Washington. He noted reports that Israel was establishing civilian settlements in the newly occupied West Bank. This not only violated the Geneva Conventions, Mr Rusk wrote, but also “creates the strong appearance that Israel… does not intend to reach a settlement involving withdrawal from those areas”. Today more than 440,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements, a figure that has grown roughly fourfold since the Oslo accords were signed. The world has done nothing to halt their growth. Diplomats have accepted the fiction that the settlements are temporary, a claim belied by billions of shekels invested in homes and infrastructure over decades. Some settlers have now lived in the West Bank for two generations. Negotiators insist that big settlement “blocs”, which house about three-quarters of the settlers in the West Bank, are no obstacle to a peace deal. Yet one of the largest, Ariel, sits almost halfway across the width of the West Bank. The blocs carve ribbons and punch holes in the outline of a Palestinian state (see map). More than 100,000 Israelis live outside them, in isolated communities that would need to be evacuated—more than 12 times the number removed from Gaza during Israel’s disengagement from that territory in 2005. Settlers wield a level of political power today they did not hold back then. Five parties in the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) are ideologically committed to expanding settlements deep in the West Bank. Together they hold 56 seats, five shy of a majority. Even members of the Labour party have urged Israel to annex large chunks of the West Bank and end the fiction of “temporary” settlement. A poll conducted last year by the Israel Democracy Institute found that just 30% of Israelis opposed doing so. Mr Trump’s peace plan was widely mocked. But the map it offered, an archipelago of Palestinian territory connected by roads and tunnels and pockmarked with Israeli enclaves, was probably a realistic vision of how a peace agreement would look. (It still did not satisfy the settler movement, for which the very existence of a Palestinian state is anathema.) His plan did not offer even the pretence of a capital for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem, which they have long sought (the area is largely Palestinian). Instead they would house their future government in dismal suburbs on the far side of Israel’s concrete separation barrier. That too reflects current trends in Israeli politics. No big party accepts the city’s division. Jerusalem is now ringed with settlements, home to more than 200,000 Israelis, making it impossible to give the Palestinians a contiguous capital and difficult even to connect the northern and southern halves of the West Bank. Right-wing Israeli groups are using courts to try to expel Palestinians from their homes in Arab-majority neighbourhoods. The settler movement is not shy about its objectives. Each hill it claims in the West Bank, each home it seizes in East Jerusalem, makes it harder for Israel to cede the occupied territories in a final agreement with the Palestinians. The settlers’ spoiling is working, but they need not worry, anyway: there is no Palestinian leader to strike such a deal. Mahmoud Abbas has been president since 2005, serving an endless four-year term. Two-thirds of Palestinians are unhappy with his performance; 68% want him gone. Mr Abbas rules by decree, but he has no legitimacy to speak on behalf of Palestinians, half of whom are outside his remit anyway. The community in East Jerusalem feels adrift and leaderless, caught between the PA, which has no authority there, and the Israeli government, which most Palestinians are ineligible to vote for. The 2m in Gaza live under the rule of Hamas, which offers, at best, a lengthy truce with Israel. In Israel, meanwhile, the peace process is no longer a salient political issue. That is largely thanks to the long-serving prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. He tepidly endorsed a two-state solution in 2009, but has spent much of his career working to prevent it. Foreign diplomats often say the occupation is unsustainable. In the short term, Mr Netanyahu has proved them wrong. The security situation is fairly calm, the economy hummed before the pandemic and Israel’s diplomatic position is better than ever. Last year it established overt ties with four Arab states. With no pressure to resolve the conflict, most Israeli parties either oppose the two-state solution or ignore it. The Labour party, once the beating heart of Israel’s peace camp—it held a 44-seat plurality at the time of the Oslo accords—won just seven seats at the last election. A poll of Palestinians in March found that just 40% still support the two-state solution, down from 51% in 2016 and 56% in 2011. Support among Israeli Jews dropped from 53% in 2016 to 42% last year. Five years ago 82% of Israeli Arabs backed the idea; today 59% do. Yet Israelis and Palestinians are not sure what they do support (see chart). Some desire a single, binational state, others an apartheid state. There are Palestinians who hope to throw all the Jews into the sea and Jews who hope to throw all the Palestinians into Jordan. The most popular choice after a two-state solution is to believe there is presently no solution. It need not be a binary choice between one state and two. Some Israelis and Palestinians talk of a confederation that would split the difference. Both communities could fulfil their national aspirations, but with shared institutions and a porous border. Both Mr Abbas and Reuven Rivlin, the outgoing Israeli president, have expressed openness to such an arrangement. It would face obstacles, not least that it requires creating a system of governance that does not exist in the world today. A binational state would have to overcome a century of hostility. Such challenges are often cited as a reason to support the status quo: a two-state solution is desirable because the alternatives would be hard. After three decades of failed negotiations, though, this argument sounds hollow. In his final weeks as secretary of state, in 2016, John Kerry warned that Israel was heading for a permanent occupation, a reality he described as “separate but unequal”. His choice of words, a reference to Jim Crow in America, was meant to jolt listeners. Yet it was less a prediction of the future than a description of reality. The four groups of Palestinians in the Holy Land all face formal and practical discrimination compared with Israeli Jews. Start with Arab Israelis, as Israel calls them, or Palestinian citizens of Israel, as many (though not all) call themselves. They hold full citizenship, if not quite full rights. A “nation-state law” passed in 2018 reserved the right of “national self-determination” for Jews alone. The poverty rate for Arabs, 36%, is double that of Jews; their average monthly income in 2018 was 34% lower. The Supreme Court has upheld the right of small towns to screen residents for “social suitability”, a practice that has been used to bar Arabs from moving in. Palestinians in East Jerusalem exist in a sort of limbo. Most refuse to seek Israeli citizenship, waiting for a solution that never comes. They risk losing their Israeli residency cards if they leave the city; more than 14,000 have been revoked since 1967. A Palestinian born a few kilometres to the north, in Ramallah, cannot visit Jerusalem without a permit. Life in the West Bank is largely confined to the one-third of its territory under a measure of Palestinian control. Hundreds of checkpoints restrict freedom of movement. Then there is Gaza. To be born there, since 2007, is to be born in a place one cannot easily leave. Israel permits only select categories of Palestinians to cross its border, while Egypt allows only a few thousand travellers a month (and some months none at all). Almost half of Gazans are unemployed and 80% need help from aid groups to survive. These divisions occasionally collapse during times of trouble, as they did this May, when unrest in Jerusalem led to rocket fire from Gaza, riots inside Israel and protests in the West Bank. In quieter times, though, Palestinian leaders are happy to help perpetuate divisions among their people in order to preserve their fiefs. Several years ago your correspondent met Mahmoud Zahar, one of the founders of Hamas, in Gaza. In the West Bank, he said, Palestinians faced the routine threat of having their homes demolished by the Israeli army, often for failing to obtain building permits that are nigh impossible to get. Not so in Gaza: “Since Hamas took power,” he said, “there has not been a single house demolition.” That would come as a surprise to Palestinians who recently endured 11 days of conflict. The fighting displaced more than 70,000 people; some have no homes to return to. A longer war in 2014 left an estimated 17,000 families, more than 100,000 people, homeless. In fact, Mr Zahar was one of them: his home was destroyed by an Israeli air strike. Such is the emptiness of Hamas’s rhetoric. To the extent that it remains popular, that is largely in contrast to the superannuated Mr Abbas. At 85, he is old enough to remember a time before Israel existed; most of his constituents are not old enough to remember a time before he was president. The PA he oversees was meant to form the nucleus of a future state. With no state on offer, today it serves mostly to distribute public-sector salaries and conduct security co-ordination with Israel. America alone has provided more than $5bn in aid to the Palestinians since 1994. Many in the West Bank wonder where it went, as they drive on rutted roads and visit overcrowded hospitals. Close to a billion dollars is thought to have vanished during Mr Arafat’s rule. Today Mr Abbas is more interested in prosecuting anti-corruption activists than pursuing corruption. As long as his security forces keep the West Bank quiet, though, the world gives him a pass. The endurance of Hamas and Fatah, Mr Abbas’s party, is indicative of how the Oslo era warped Palestinian politics. Majorities in the West Bank and Gaza think their leaders corrupt and authoritarian. But Fatah enjoys a measure of international legitimacy because it accepts a territorial compromise that is now a mirage; Hamas claims popular legitimacy by rejecting compromise and promising liberation, which is just as illusory. To discard the land-for-peace framework would mean a sea change in Palestinian politics, reflecting a stark disjuncture between generations. Older people have spent a lifetime dreaming of an independent state. Asked why they do not abandon that dream and push for equality, they reply that Israel would never accept it. Many younger Palestinians disagree. The call for statehood, they argue, lets Israel frame the conflict as a struggle between two nations on a more or less equal footing. A battle for equal rights would put the onus more squarely on Israel. The two-state paradigm turned the conflict into a land dispute. If negotiators could simply find the right path for a border, the weary parties could retreat to their respective sides. But this is also a conflict over how two peoples should live together on an uncomfortably small patch of land. Some on both sides cling to fantasies. Right-wing Israelis persist in believing that the Palestinians can be persuaded to leave or be consigned to live as second-class non-citizens, a cheap labour pool content to cross teeming checkpoints each day to till fields and swing hammers. Groups such as Hamas still insist they can outlast Israel, that one day the Jews will pack up and “go back to Europe”, never mind that most of them are native-born (and often descended from Middle Eastern Jews rather than European Jews, to boot). Here and there in Israel one sees a phrase in graffiti on walls in Hebrew and Arabic: ain lanu eretz aheret; la watan lanna badeel. “We have no other country.” The Arabs and Jews must decide how to share it; the world cannot dictate a solution. That will require a new peace process, a genuine one, with legitimacy and popular support on both sides. It is hard to envision such a process sprouting soon from such poisoned soil. But to acknowledge reality would be a start. What came before has failed, and what comes next will need to talk less of partition and more of parity. ■"
https://www.economist.com/special/2000/05/25/for-palestine-bring-in-solomon,"THEY should by now be on the last lap of the six-year stop-go trundle to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. As it is, they are not even circling. After the latest violence in the West Bank, the Israelis called off all talks. Faith in the Oslo peace process (the agreement worked out in Oslo and signed in September 1993), let alone in its declared deadline of September 2000, is minimal. A year ago, the peace business seemed to have been galvanised by the election of Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister. America and the European Union still firmly believe in Mr Barak's reasonableness; consequently, the EU no longer supports the Palestinians as warmly as it did. Athough the prime minister is no peacenik—he has built more settlement units than his predecessor, and every peace move has had to be dragged out of him—he is thought to be a pragmatist and a man of decision. Would he could be. The elements of an eventual compromise have long been clear. What is needed now is for Mr Barak and Yasser Arafat, the two men at the top, to decide between themselves what the compromise should be, and then sell it to their people. Unfortunately, though both men are autocratically inclined, neither is in a strong position.  Mr Barak's coalition still has a 68-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, but it is fragile. Moreover, before he can make peace with either the Syrians or the Palestinians, he is committed to seeking the approval of the Israeli public through referendums. Public opinion polls show a small majority in favour of a Palestinian state. But they also show that the prime minister's own standing is remarkably low.  On the Palestinian side, Mr Arafat, an old revolutionary leader turned one-man-band politician, is also unpopular with his own people. Though he does not have to worry about democratic party politics, his administration is damned for corruption, mismanagement and much else besides. The Palestinian diaspora has always been deeply sceptical of the Oslo peace process, believing that it betrays their profoundest hopes. But by now West Bankers and Gazans are almost equally disenchanted. Their standard of living has deteriorated since 1993: income per person is down by about one-fifth, unemployment has risen sharply, and freedom of movement is a myth. It takes longer to get to Gaza than to New York, says a disgruntled West Banker.  Above all, Palestinians are afraid that Mr Arafat might be tempted to relinquish what they see as their basic rights in return for a deeply flawed, and possibly temporary, peace. There is a great turning back to first principles, with little appetite for compromise. The fact that Lebanon has got all its Israeli-occupied land back—and got it by force—encourages the Palestinians to question why they should be asked to settle for less. As Mr Arafat's increasingly inflexible people point out, a return to the 1967 line would still mean a Palestinian state on only 22% of the Palestine covered by the British mandate. They want Mr Arafat to insist on 100% of the 22%, not accept the 70-80% he is likely to be offered. And they are demanding, just as unrealistically, that the new state should be founded on the principle that East Jerusalem is its sovereign capital and that the refugees who were forced out of Israel in 1948 have the right to return. With grandstanding on both sides, a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian settlement, covering everything, is virtually unobtainable. If any practical result is to be had, aims, and voices, have to be lowered. But achieving lower aims will be difficult, too. Mr Barak's strategy is to try for two agreements. The first would be the “framework agreement”, which missed its second deadline on May 13th. The second would be the permanent deal that is set for September, but is almost certain to slip. This two-stage process—guidelines first, details later—copies the model of the Camp David agreement with Egypt in 1978, which was followed the next year by the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. But the devil this time is in the guidelines, not the details.  Israel's latest idea, or so it now seems, is that the framework agreement would not try to set out agreed principles, except vaguely, but would concentrate on the outlines of a Palestinian state. It would consider what the borders of such a state should be, and deal with the closely related subjects of Jewish settlements and establishing Israel's own security. The other “final-status” issues—Jerusalem, refugees and water—would be left to the next stage. The toughest questions of all—Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the refugees' right of return—would be postponed indefinitely. It is not that the border and settlement questions are simple; but they are a priority. Until these problems are sorted out, there can be no movement towards a separate Palestinian entity. Moreover, if they are not resolved, the Palestinians will insist, as is their right under the interim agreements, on another Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in advance of a permanent agreement. Even worse for Israel, Mr Arafat might be tempted to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally. The current map of the West Bank is madness. Under the five-year interim agreement, the Israelis have grudgingly been handing back slices of territory: either to full Palestinian control, or to Palestinian administrative authority while Israel keeps security control. The Palestinians currently control, fully or partially, some 40% of the West Bank. The amount of land handed over, and where it was, was entirely up to Israel to decide.   The result is a crazy hotchpotch of Palestinian-controlled towns and villages (see map), each patch divided from the next by Israeli-held territory. Arab villages are overlooked by settlements; some are split in half by roads. In Hebron and East Jerusalem, Israelis have settled themselves at the centre of Arab living areas. Although the bulk of the settlers in the West Bank are there for convenience, subsidised housing, space and air, quite a few went, or were sent, expressly to make it difficult to return the land.   Mr Barak seems ready, as his predecessor was not, to offer the Palestinians more contiguous blocks of land. Current Israeli thinking suggests two blocks in the West Bank: one in the north and one in the south, split by an Israeli corridor. Shimon Peres, a former prime minister not much liked by the current one, is said to have been set the job of devising a way of linking the two.  But the envisaged area would still be tiny. As well as allowing for natural increase—Palestinian numbers are now growing much faster than Israel's—the 3m or so Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are expected to be joined by a fair number of the 2.3m refugees now in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The new state would be squeezed between a wavy strip of Israeli-annexed land to the west (containing most of the Israeli settlements, with a finger stretching as far as Ariel, Israel's second-largest settlement) and a possible buffer zone of undecided width to the east, which would quarantine the Palestinian state from Jordan. Despite its good relations with its eastern neighbour, Israel remains fearful of a regional war and is determined to keep at least part of the Jordan valley in its own hands.  It has been calculated that if Israel annexes something less than 10% of the West Bank it can still accommodate more than 80% of the 170,000 or so Israeli settlers (this excludes the roughly similar number of settlers in occupied East Jerusalem). The remaining settlers would either be rehoused or continue where they are under Palestinian rule. Mr Barak's government wants to annex or keep more land than that. A proposal by Haim Ramon, a cabinet member, suggests that 10% of the West Bank (containing most of the settlements) should be annexed by Israel; 70% should go directly to the Palestinians; and another 20%, which would include a wide strip of the Jordan valley, should be leased to Israel for an undetermined period. Although these percentages are unacceptable to the other side, the formula of leasing controversial patches of land could contain the elements of an eventual compromise. Jerusalem, holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, arouses passionate emotion. Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967; in 1980 a basic law declared the city its “eternal, undivided capital”. Israelis are united in insisting on this. But the annexation is unrecognised by the rest of the world and, as a result, all countries, save for Costa Rica and El Salvador, keep their embassies in Tel Aviv. Israel craves the legitimacy of recognition. Nobody wants to divide Jerusalem again, or to resurrect the ugly dividing line that scarred the city between 1948 and 1967. But the city—its stones, its history and its symbolism no less than its holy places—means as much to the Palestinians as it does to the Israelis. It is part of their collective memory, and they are determined to see it as their capital, drawing the separate blocks of their putative state together into a more homogeneous whole. Few Israelis will contemplate diluting the principle of exclusive Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem. But even fewer ever venture into the cluster of Arab districts and villages that, together with the post-1967 Israeli settlements, make up East Jerusalem. Despite the settlements that ring the Arab city, forming a cordon sanitaire between it and the West Bank, the place still feels like two cities. Recognising this, many people have suggested compromises that would give the Israelis and Palestinians administrative control of their own areas, while an umbrella body dealt with joint concerns. The end-game in most of these proposals is that the undivided city should be capital to both states. If the Palestinians are to be persuaded to defer a decision on their sovereignty, they would have to be satisfied about the degree of municipal authority they are given, including the intensely sensitive issues of zoning and residency rights in East Jerusalem. They would also look for an Israeli commitment to stop, or go slow on, settlement expansion. But there are no signs, at present, that Israel is ready to grant this.  More than 800,000-900,000 Palestinians fled from Israel during its war of independence. Resolutions at the UN General Assembly called for their right of return and for compensation. But the refugees, who now number around 3m, were offered neither. Israel acknowledged no responsibility, and it suited the Arab world to preserve them as a visible sign of the injustice of Israel's creation. Jordan alone gave them citizenship. A UN agency was set up to keep them alive, but many still live in their original camps or shanty towns. Mr Arafat, if he is not to be charged with betraying these dispossessed people, has to try to get Israel to acknowledge their right to return—even if only on paper. But Israel, though not all Israeli historians, still refuses to accept responsibility for the Palestinians' flight. This, explains one senior politician, would be tantamount to admitting that the Israeli state had been born in sin. There is no room for compromise between these irreconcilable principles—which makes it almost certain that, despite Palestinian protestations, the principle of “right of return” will be deferred. But this does not mean that nothing practical can be done in the meantime. International money would be an excellent beginning, allowing the UN, with the richer world behind it, to start looking into compensation for those who can, or want to, stay in their host countries. And the new Palestinian state could be helped to absorb those who want to make the West Bank their permanent home. Israel, too, might well be willing to absorb a limited number, so long as it was plain that it did so voluntarily, for humanitarian reasons. In particular, Israel could come to the rescue of the worst-off refugees of all, the Palestinians in Lebanon, who, because they upset the country's religious balance, are allowed only minimal rights. Since many of them came originally from Galilee, the return of some of them to Arab villages in the region would not rock the Israeli state.  In all this, one fundamental question has barely been touched on in the negotiations for a permanent settlement. That is water, and its vital importance in a parched region. “I can wait to pray at al-Aqsa mosque [in Jerusalem] but I can't wait for a clean glass of water,” says a Palestinian official. The current distribution of available water is grossly unjust. The Palestinians' use per person, in towns and for farming, is only 30% of the Israelis'. The settlers, profligate with irrigation, consume five or six times as much per person as their Palestinian neighbours. The Israelis use waste water for a lot of their farming; the Palestinians are only now being allowed to set up water-treatment plants, and still under conditions they find unacceptable. When it comes to drinking, 37% of West Bankers are without piped water, and the Gazans drink water that is hardly fit for fields. The answer, argue Israelis, lies in increasing resources, not in redistribution. They look, with hope, to desalination. This is a good answer for a country that has money, technical prowess and a long coastline. But it is not the answer for Gaza, which is broke, has no energy sources and where the pipe leakage is something like 60%, let alone for the inland West Bank. A fair solution would be to bring the quantity and quality of Palestinian drinking water up to Israeli standards, and then negotiate on irrigation water. Both Israel and the Palestinian territories would benefit from a change in farming habits towards less thirsty crops. But nothing like that is close to being discussed. Israel's agricultural lobby is greedy and powerful; Gazans would be aghast at giving up citrus or flowers.  Israel controls the use of all the surface water from the Jordan and virtually all the ground water from the aquifers that criss-cross the West Bank (see map). Its version of the future border between itself and a Palestinian state is partly dictated by its determination to keep as much control as it can. The Palestinians have not, as yet, seriously challenged this. They will, when the issue of water creeps up the agenda.  How can it be, after so much negotiation, over so many years, that the two sides are still so far apart on basic issues? From the beginning it was known where the talks would eventually head. Yet they still sound much as they did at the start.  The back-channel talks in Stockholm that were called off last weekend will presumably get going again, perhaps plotting a way past those irreconcilable principles. Look how the Oslo back-channel took everybody by surprise and delight in 1993, breaking a log-jam, delivering peace and Nobel prize-winners, and setting the current negotiations in train. But look again. It was Oslo's ambiguity, and lack of substance, that helped to cause the present disenchantment. What is needed now are decisions, not clever, ambiguous formulae. Mr Barak and Mr Arafat alone have the power to deliver such decisions, and the authority to persuade their people to accept them. The question is whether they are ready to do so."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/11/the-palestinian-authority-is-being-eclipsed-by-radical-militants,"The Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover, which coincide this year, ought to be a time when two of the three Abrahamic religions reflect on their common beliefs and shared destiny in the Holy Land. Instead, the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is at risk of a dangerous escalation. In just five days from April 5th Israel was hit by rockets launched from Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. The ostensible trigger was clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police forces who had entered the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites. Videos showed police beating people inside the mosque, while young Palestinians shot fireworks at them. In all this, one actor is noticeably absent: the Palestinian Authority (PA), which was set up under the Oslo accords almost 30 years ago as an interim administration to lead the Palestinians into statehood. Now the body headed by Mahmoud Abbas, 87, is becoming irrelevant as the last vestige of a moribund peace process. Undemocratic, ineffectual and mired in corruption, it is losing touch with Palestinians. This was laid bare last year when Palestinian security forces arrested Musaab Shtayyeh, a low-level Hamas financier, in the West Bank city of Nablus. The arrest sparked a day of violence in Nablus, as local armed groups rioted, demanding his release from Palestinian custody. They clashed, not with Israeli soldiers, but with Palestinian security forces. From the outset the PA’s legitimacy rested on it being a partner in a peace process that was meant to create a Palestinian state alongside a Jewish one. But with talks frozen for decades, the PA faces an existential crisis. A study last month by a leading Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shikaki, found for the first time that a majority of Palestinians (52%) said the PA’s collapse or dissolution was in their interest. There are several reasons why Palestinians are losing faith in the PA, but a key one is that it looks hapless in response to the continued construction of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory. Moreover, the PA has also been unable to protect Palestinians from violence inflicted on them by Israeli settlers, who rampage from time to time through Palestinian towns and fields, beating people and destroying their orchards and vines. This violence has only increased since Binyamin Netanyahu returned to office as Israel’s prime minister in December with the backing of right-wing parties, including those led by Jewish supremacists. The PA’s authority is further undermined when Israel carries out bloody raids in Area A, which largely comprises Palestinian cities under the control of the Palestinian security forces. Since the collapse of the peace process, many Palestinians have begun to reconcile themselves to the PA morphing from the harbinger of an independent state into something of a glorified municipality that merely provides basic services. Now it is failing even in that role. Public services are paralysed by strikes over unpaid wages. Schools in the West Bank have barely been running since 20,000 teachers went on strike in early February. Hospitals are short of key medicines. “The PA cannot honour its obligations,” says Raja Al Khalidi of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute in Ramallah, the Palestinians’ administrative capital. “That’s a form of collapse [even if] it’s not a physical collapse.” Prickly Palestinian officials argue that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank makes it almost impossible for them to govern. They are also short of cash, not least because Israel has withheld some 4bn shekels ($1.1bn) in customs revenues that it collects on the PA’s behalf. Israel says this is because the PA is not keeping its side of the deal by maintaining security. It is also furious that the PA makes payments to the families of those killed carrying out attacks on Israelis, many of them civilians. Yet the issue goes beyond money. “It’s not just about salaries,” says Youssef Joha, a leader of the teachers’ strike. “There’s an issue of trust with the PA.” The PA’s budget troubles and crumbling administrative capacity are affecting its security services too. A senior officer says at any time some 2,500 of the force’s 83,000 members fail to turn up because they are supplementing their salaries with jobs in construction or hospitality in Israel. This is because a major-general in the Palestinian security forces has a salary of just 12,160 shekels a month, while a private would get just 1,900 shekels. By contrast, a Palestinian doing manual labour in Israel can earn at least 6,000 shekels a month. In recent months the PA has largely lost control of security in the West Bank’s main cities such as Jenin and Nablus, where armed groups have emerged, such as the Lions’ Den. These are thought to be responsible for attacks against Israeli targets in the West Bank, including against civilians. Though the PA has come under international pressure to regain control of Nablus and Jenin, it is in a bind. If it sends in the troops, as it did last year in the case of Mr Shtayyeh, it will be further delegitimised in the eyes of Palestinians. Yet if it holds back, Israeli forces are more likely to intervene, often with deadly results. Its crisis of legitimacy is not helped by its undemocratic ways. The last time Palestinians got to vote for members of the legislative council was in 2006. Mr Abbas, who was elected president in 2005, is in the 19th year of a four-year term. He shows no desire to leave his presidential palace, which polls suggest would happen if he were to put his name on the ballot. In 2021 Mr Abbas cancelled legislative elections after polls indicated his Fatah party faced defeat. Many Palestinians glumly accept that there will be no elections until he dies. International donors are frustrated by the PA’s lack of democracy, transparency and legitimacy. “There has been a tightening of the screws,” says a European diplomat, noting that foreign aid increasingly goes to NGOs or directly to hospitals. “We barely deal with the PA any more.” Most older Palestinians oppose the resumption of an armed struggle because they do not want a repeat of the second intifada, or uprising, which claimed more than 3,000 Palestinian and 1,000 Israeli lives between 2000 and 2005. Yet attitudes are changing. A poll issued last month by Mr Shikaki found that 54% of Palestinians thought violence was the best way to end Israel’s occupation; 68% favoured forming armed groups such as the Lions’ Den, which the PA does not control. Mr Abbas and the PA must shoulder much of the blame for the authority’s predicament. But Israel, which relies a great deal on its co-operation in security, has done much to weaken the PA. Were it to disintegrate further, it would leave a vacuum that would probably be filled by violent factions that have given up entirely on the peace process. As deeply flawed as the PA is, many may come to rue its passing. ■"
https://www.economist.com/news/2006/02/21/the-new-face-of-palestine," FOR those who could bear to sit through it, the swearing-in of the new Palestinian legislature on Saturday February 18th told the story of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its current woes in microcosm. Israel would not let Hamas lawmakers from Gaza travel to the West Bank for the session, so they had to join in via a video link that emitted alarming echoes and periodically crashed. A speech by one of the defeated Fatah party's elder statesmen, Salim Zanoun, turned into a rambling rant that had some Fatah members shouting at him while others clutched their heads in shame at this valedictory demonstration of their party's ineptness.  Then, Mahmoud Abbas, the PA's president (also a Fatah man), who pointedly got up to take a break during Mr Zanoun's speech, gave his own address in which he exhorted Hamas to abandon violence and follow the path of negotiations with Israel. Hamas legislators listened respectfully but coldly. There was only one candidate for speaker—Hamas's Aziz Dweik—but his election was conducted with laborious attention to procedural detail while Fatah members (who had fielded nobody to avoid the indignity of losing yet again) defiantly turned in blank ballot papers. And the foreign diplomatic corps, which had turned out in force for Mr Abbas's speech, exited en masse afterwards, to avoid being present for Hamas's first official act. Isolated and hemmed in on all sides, Hamas now has to form a government. On Tuesday its nominee for prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, met Mr Abbas and received his letter of accreditation, giving him five weeks to put together a government. The new Palestinian prime minister is a legislator from Gaza who led his party's national list and who is described variously as a pragmatist and a relative moderate, in Hamas terms. This week Hamas began talks with other Palestinian factions, including armed militant groups, to see if they will join it in a national-unity government. On Monday Islamic Jihad, which has continued to stage attacks in Israel despite a tentative ceasefire by other militant groups, said it would not join. The same day, the group's military commander in the West Bank was shot dead by Israeli troops in Nablus.  Hamas would like to bring Fatah people into its government too. Mr Abbas said on Monday that his party might join under certain conditions. But Fatah is divided and the inclination among most of its members is to let Hamas run things and make its own mistakes. If it cannot get others to join it, Hamas says, it will appoint non-political technocrats to the key ministries. But there are few hints as to who those might be. Whoever is chosen for the new cabinet, it is unlikely to appease Hamas's main enemies. With Israeli elections due on March 28th, there is great pressure on Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister and heir apparent to Ariel Sharon, to take a tough line. Israel followed the inauguration of the legislature by announcing that it would, as planned, start treating the PA as a terrorist entity. It will cut off the revenues that it collects on the PA's behalf and is supposed to transfer to it under an economic agreement signed in the 1990s, and will continue to restrict Hamas legislators' movements, even within the West Bank (some had to slip around checkpoints to get to the opening session). The United States, where a proposed bill would effectively impose a blanket ban on contacts and funding to the PA, is putting the squeeze on Hamas too. While Hamas leaders have been travelling around the Middle East drumming up funds, the American secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has embarked on her own tour of the region to persuade Arab governments to withhold all but humanitarian aid. America is also asking the PA to give back $50m of unspent money that had been slated for infrastructure projects. European donors remain divided, but it is likely that they will have to scale back at least some funding. With all this, a fiscal crisis is going to bite soon. The PA paid its salaries some ten days late this month, after Israel decided to make one last revenue transfer. There is no knowing when the pay packets due on March 1st will arrive. Since the PA's 137,000 staff are estimated to support around a third of the Palestinian population with their wages, the West's sanctions will be keenly felt. Palestinians are worried about their prospects—but after Fatah's dismal failure in everything from running basic services to negotiating peace, they are not about to run back to it. If anything, the outside pressure on Hamas could strengthen solidarity with it. And the funding squeeze may not be particularly effective either. Even if the West cuts off its own aid and persuades the more compliant Middle Eastern governments to do the same—which would further inflame an already angry Arab street across the region—there are many informal networks, through Islamic charities in various countries, business people, or smugglers, that could let cash trickle through.  Furthermore, if Hamas succeeds in cutting the corruption and inefficiency in the PA, which has thousands of fictitious employees on the books, it may find that it can get by with considerably less than before. If so, that could make for a PA that is both leaner and meaner, and perhaps even less inclined to meet the West's demands—to recognise Israel and renounce violence—than Hamas is now."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2016/06/02/a-museum-without-exhibits,"THE Palestinians’ new national museum is a striking monument to the state they don’t yet have. Designed by a firm in Dublin, the museum itself is angular and modern, with glass curtain walls topped by smooth white limestone. From afar it looks almost like a low-slung bunker perched on a hill north of Ramallah; inside, though, it is light and airy. A terraced garden stretches out below, filled with dozens of local species: almond and fig trees, mint and za’atar. Only one thing is missing—the exhibits. When the first visitors arrive in June, they will tour an empty building. The curators had spent years planning an inaugural exhibition, “Never Part”, about the personal effects that Palestinian refugees took when they fled their homes. But the museum’s director, Jack Persekian, resigned in December, citing “disagreements” with management, and the show was postponed. The saga of the $24m museum feels like a microcosm of Palestine’s broader problems. The idea of building it was first conceived in 1997, but the plans were soon suspended amid the violence of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising. The organisers did not break ground until 2013, and the project, which they aimed to complete within a year, was plagued by a series of cost overruns and delays. The museum blames many of those on Israel, which controls the border between Jordan and the occupied West Bank. The Austrian-made emergency-exit signs were inexplicably delayed by Israeli customs authorities; so were light fixtures from Germany. The Jordanian landscaper, meanwhile, has not been able to get a visa, so he supervises the grounds via video chat. These are common complaints among developers in the area. Bashar al-Masri, a wealthy businessman who is building Palestine’s first planned city, keeps six months of inventory on hand to cope with the inevitable delays at the border. The need for vast warehouses, filled with everything from cement to marble, adds to the cost and the logistical challenges. The museum is run by a private organisation, which at least spares it from the West Bank’s incessant political feuding. Mahmoud Abbas, the unpopular president, is in the 11th year of a four-year term, and is increasingly paranoid about his grip on power. Last year he sacked Yasser Abed Rabbo, a vocal critic who was, in effect, the number-two man in the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In an added fit of pique, Mr Abbas also booted him from his job as director of the Mahmoud Darwish Foundation, which runs a museum dedicated to Palestine’s national poet. Over the past decade the Palestinians have built many of the trappings of a state: a police force, a central bank. At the inauguration ceremony on May 18th, Mr Abbas called the museum another important step. “The only thing left is declaring independence, which you will all declare soon,” he said. Yet the peace process is comatose, Israel’s government is unyielding and the Palestinians are hopelessly divided between Mr Abbas and the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza. Few believe him—including, it seems, the museum’s directors. Without an independent state, the 1.8m people in Gaza cannot visit, nor can the 3m refugees who live in neighbouring countries. So the curators are planning a series of satellite shows. The first exhibition in Palestine’s national museum, about the history of local embroidery, will be in Beirut."
https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/28/the-culture-war-over-the-gaza-war,"The imagery is enticing, the rhythm and rhyme are propulsive. “From the river to the sea,” runs the popular slogan, “Palestine will be free!” In recent days that couplet has resounded in squares from Toronto to Berlin. Wearing chequered keffiyeh scarves, Californian pupils declaimed it as they swept down school corridors. Activists projected the words onto a wall of a university in Washington, DC. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas What do they mean? Superficially an idealistic vow of liberation, the decades-old expression also contains a threat: the river is the River Jordan, the sea is the Mediterranean and freedom, in this case, implies the destruction of the state of Israel. That is certainly the sense in which Hamas uses the phrase. The children chanting it at the base of Nelson’s column in London on October 21st, during a big pro-Palestinian march, may not have grasped the menace. But several marchers who were yelling the words, or bearing them on placards, seemed aware of it, clamming up defensively when asked to explain them. “Anyone who’s paying attention knows exactly what that means,” says Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League, an American anti-hate group which, like watchdogs in Britain and elsewhere, has documented a steep rise in antisemitic incidents since Hamas’s bloody raid on Israel on October 7th. (Islamophobic incidents have multiplied in several countries, too.) The ubiquity of this deceptively hardline mantra points up an important shift in Western attitudes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Three related forces are driving it: technology, demography and ideology. The Western left once sympathised with Zionism. That changed markedly after the six-day war of 1967 and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Especially since the end of apartheid in South Africa, the Palestinian cause has been a talismanic issue for left-leaning Westerners. Why it acquired this status is a matter of debate. In some analyses, Israel serves as an avatar for American power, or for bygone colonial struggles. Jewish groups and others have wondered why the casualties in, say, Syria or Afghanistan—where the perpetrators as well as the victims are Muslim—stir less bien-pensant concern. After a period in which the issue receded in prominence in Western diplomacy and headlines, Gaza’s plight is now inspiring protests and disputes as never before. A glut of open letters by artists and other luminaries have decried Israel’s bombardment and Western leaders’ acquiescence to it. (Counter-petitions mourn the atrocities of October 7th and affirm Israel’s right to self-defence.) Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held in many cities, including some where they were notionally banned. The recriminations flow both ways. In Britain the BBC’s reluctance to refer to Hamas as “terrorists” led to an outcry and a partial climbdown. Dave Chappelle, an American comedian, reportedly had a spat with punters at a gig in Boston after he lamented the crisis in Gaza. Some American students have been hounded for their stridently anti-Israel views; talks by Palestinian authors have been cancelled. Palestine Legal, which supports pro-Palestinian activists in America, says they are “facing a wave of McCarthyite backlash targeting their livelihoods and careers”. “Silence is violence”, runs another popular protest slogan, a position taken by some on all sides. A range of institutions, from universities to unions, have been berated for the wording of their public statements, or for failing to issue one. Calls for peace have been likened to appeasement. And supporters of both Israel and the Palestinians make analogies with Ukraine to show the supposed hypocrisy of the opposing camp. Backers of the Palestinians see Gaza as the victim (like Ukraine) of invasion by a bullying neighbour. Pro-Israelis point to Hamas’s incursion and liken its barbarity to Russian war crimes. The polarised passions and viral slogans are in part a sharp manifestation of the echo-chamber effect of social media. Millions of people have watched footage of Hamas’s depredations in horror. Many others are transfixed instead by images of Gaza’s agony. In Germany, for instance, where a synagogue has been firebombed and Stars of David daubed on Jewish homes, some Islamists exist in “parallel societies”, relying on digital and overseas news, says Felix Klein, the federal commissioner for antisemitism. So, he adds, do many on the far right, which commits most of the country’s antisemitic crimes. (There, as in America, the two groups have made common cause online.) Worse, the heart-rending clips and pictures sometimes come from the wrong country or the wrong war, or even from video games. Like the echo-chamber effect, online disinformation is a familiar problem that has seemed as acute as ever in the ongoing crisis.  The blast at the Ahli Arab hospital on October 17th was a supreme example of the reach and clout of falsehoods. Swiftly picked up by major news outfits, misleading reports contributed, in short order, to the cancelling of a summit between Arab leaders and President Joe Biden. Demand for disinformation, reckons Peter Pomerantsev of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is an even bigger problem than supply. In wartime, “people are looking for reasons to confirm their biases,” he says glumly. “It isn’t about the facts.” Screen habits encourage another striking feature of reactions to the war: the “gamification” of news, whereby irony and taboo-busting are prized, even amid the gravest calamities. The paragliders on which some Hamas murderers flew to Israel were, for a few onlookers, irresistibly meme-worthy. Black Lives Matter Chicago briefly posted an image of a paraglider with the words, “I stand with Palestine.” “From Chicago to Gaza,” runs another of its messages, “from the river to the sea.” As for demography: immigration is one factor skewing the culture war in the West over the tragic one in the Middle East. Muslim populations in Western countries are both growing and changing in composition. In the past, notes Yunus Ulusoy of the Centre for Turkish Studies and Integration Research in Essen, the Muslim population in Germany was of predominantly Turkish origin. Now, he says, around 2.1m Muslims in the country have roots in Syria, Iraq and other places that are hostile to Israel. They brought their views of the conflict with them—shaped, says Mr Ulusoy, by a sense of solidarity with the ummah, or global Muslim community. Awareness of Nazism and the Holocaust, which for decades coloured German attitudes to Israel and antisemitism, is waning. Some Muslims, says Professor Julia Bernstein of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, think this awful past “is not our history”, and that they are now the real victims of prejudice in Germany. France, notes Dominique Moïsi, an eminent French commentator, is home to both the largest Muslim population in western Europe and the biggest Jewish one. It has a traumatic recent history of Islamist terrorism, and a more distant one of collaboration with the Nazis, both of which tend to bolster support for Israel. But it also harbours contrary strains of anti-Americanism and guilt over French colonialism in the Arab world. The result, says Mr Moïsi, is a “conflict of memories” that plays out in politics and on the streets. In America, the most influential depiction of Israel in popular culture is probably “Exodus”. A novel by Leon Uris published in 1958, it dramatises the birth of the state and became a film starring Paul Newman. (“As a piece of propaganda,” said David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, “Exodus” was “the greatest thing ever written” about the country.) Overall, Americans remain much more supportive of Israel than are Europeans. Polls conducted since October 7th show a hardening of support for it among Democrats in particular. But there is an important demographic wrinkle. As Tim Malloy, a polling analyst at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, says, younger Americans are much less inclined to back Israel than are their elders. They also think more favourably of the Palestinian people. According to surveys by Pew, this gap in sympathy between American generations is widening (see chart). Many young voters do not have direct memories of the attacks of September 11th 2001, a calamity which shaped older Americans’ views of Islamist terrorists such as Hamas. Their diverging outlook also reflects the third force swaying Western attitudes: a binary ideology that emerged from American universities to win converts far and wide. Seeing the world in Manichean terms can be comforting. It turns confounding issues into simple clashes of good and evil, conferring a halo of virtue on those who pick the right side. As Yascha Mounk, author of “The Identity Trap”, argues, the emerging ideology offers just this form of comfort, sorting the world into opposing categories—coloniser and colonised, oppressors and oppressed—often along racial lines. In essence it transposes the terms of American debates over race onto other places and problems. “The American brand of anti-colonialism”, quips Mr Mounk, “is astonishingly colonialist.” In a polarised age, lots of people infer their opinions from their political allegiance rather than the other way round. This, thinks Mr Mounk, is part of the new ideology’s appeal: it furnishes an all-purpose vocabulary to apply to any conflict. In this schema, the powerless can do no wrong, least of all to the powerful—and nobody can be both. Liberation movements of all kinds are linked, as communist insurgencies purported to be during the cold war. As flares in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off at Piccadilly Circus, a protester in London holding a “Queers for Palestine” sign explained that “All the struggles are connected.” This philosophy is tailor-made for the posturing and character-limits of social-media posts, perhaps one reason it is gaining adherents. But it prohibits the balance and nuanced judgments that intractable real-world hostilities demand. In particular, because the Palestinians are cast as powerless, and Israel is classed as powerful, it follows that Israelis cannot qualify as victims. Never mind the exile of Mizrahi Jews from Arab countries to Israel. The Holocaust is ancient history. The schema shows up glaringly in references to Hamas’s crimes as a form of “resistance” or “decolonisation”, and in the statement by some Harvard students that held Israel “entirely responsible” for the slaughter of its own citizens. Many Jews, in Israel and the diaspora, perceive a wider disregard for Israel’s suffering—not just less sympathy than it received during, say, the Entebbe hostage crisis of 1976, but a void. If the issue is morally simple, meanwhile, for many Western activists the remedy is blunt and drastic: not the two-state solution of yore, but a Palestine that stretches “from the river to the sea”. In the left-leaning political elite, the picture is starkly different. Both Mr Biden and Sir Keir Starmer, leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, have offered Israel staunch support. All the same, the escalation in some rank-and-file attitudes to the war may have a lasting fallout—both in the Middle East and in the West. Mr Biden, Sir Keir and other leaders have been lambasted by some in their parties for declining to call for a ceasefire. This disapproval—often motivated by natural compassion for Palestinian civilians rather than ideology—may cost them votes, Muslim and otherwise, in what may be tight elections next year. (Mr Biden may have weighed that risk against the potentially higher cost of supporting a ceasefire.) That may not be the only form of political blowback. Plenty of liberal voters are dismayed by the responses of people with whom, in the past, they felt broadly aligned. Their coalition with more radical voters was already under pressure; for some liberals, the bedrock of common values that they thought underpinned it seems to have crumbled. If the debate over Gaza has been a symptom of polarisation in the West, it may yet prove to be a cause of realignment, too. The consequences for Israel and the Middle East are unpredictable. At least in the short term, revulsion for Hamas seems to outweigh any qualms Americans might have had before the war over Israel’s rightward lurch under Binyamin Netanyahu. Most Americans, including most Democrats, tell pollsters that supporting Israel is in American interests. How far and how long that remains the case depends on a series of unknowns—starting with the conduct and outcome of the ground invasion of Gaza, and the new dispensation that may follow. Developments in domestic politics will matter, including the fervour of the Republican embrace of isolationism. From an Israeli point of view, though, the long-term trajectory of opinion in America is worrying. And in Europe, as the second world war recedes from living memory and the clout of Muslim voters grows, support for Israel may continue to soften, especially on the left. Even as the disaster in Israel and Gaza unfolds, one of its morals is already clear. Amid the unchecked flow of images and ideas, Western public opinion and geopolitical conflicts are entangled in new and explosive ways. Culture wars and real wars are no longer separate struggles. ■"
https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2011/05/17/here-comes-your-non-violent-resistance,"FOR many years now, we've heard American commentators bemoan the violence of the Palestinian national movement. If only Palestinians had learned the lessons of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, we hear, they'd have had their state long ago. Surely no Israeli government would have violently suppressed a non-violent Palestinian movement of national liberation seeking only the universally recognised right of self-determination. Palestinian commentators and organisers, including Fadi Elsalameen and Moustafa Barghouthi, have spent the last couple of years pointing out that these complaints resolutely ignore the actual and growing Palestinian non-violent resistance movement. For that matter, they elide the fact that the first intifada, which broke out in 1987, was initially as close to non-violent as could be reasonably expected. For the most part, it consisted of general strikes and protest marches. In addition, there was a fair amount of kids throwing rocks, as well as the continuing threat of low-level terrorism, mainly from organisations based abroad; the Israelis conflated the autochthonous protest movement with the terrorism and responded brutally, and the intifada quickly lost its non-violent character. That's not that different from what has happened over the past couple of months in Libya; it shows that it's very hard to keep a non-violent movement non-violent when the government you're demonstrating against subjects you to gunfire for a sustained period of time. In any case, if you're among those who have made the argument that Israelis would give Palestinians a state if only the Palestinians would learn to employ Ghandhian tactics of non-violent protest, it appears your moment of truth has arrived. As my colleague writes, what happened on Nakba Day was Israel's ""nightmare scenario: masses of Palestinians marching, unarmed, towards the borders of the Jewish state, demanding the redress of their decades-old national grievance."" Peter Beinart writes that this represents ""Israel's Palestinian Arab Spring"": the tactics of mass non-violent protest that brought down the governments of Tunisia and Egypt, and are threatening to bring down those of Libya, Yemen and Syria, are now being used in the Palestinian cause. So now we have an opportunity to see how Americans will react. We've asked the Palestinians to lay down their arms. We've told them their lack of a state is their own fault; if only they would embrace non-violence, a reasonable and unprejudiced world would see the merit of their claims. Over the weekend, tens of thousands of them did just that, and it seems likely to continue. If crowds of tens of thousands of non-violent Palestinian protestors continue to march, and if Israel continues to shoot at them, what will we do? Will we make good on our rhetoric, and press Israel to give them their state? Or will it turn out that our paeans to non-violence were just cynical tactics in an amoral international power contest staged by militaristic Israeli and American right-wing groups whose elective affinities lead them to shape a common narrative of the alien Arab/Muslim threat? Will we even bother to acknowledge that the Palestinians are protesting non-violently? Or will we soldier on with the same empty decades-old rhetoric, now drained of any truth or meaning, because it protects established relationships of power? What will it take to make Americans recognise that the real Martin Luther King-style non-violent Palestinian protestors have arrived, and that Israeli soldiers are shooting them with real bullets?

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/01/30/mahmoud-abbas-calls-for-elections-in-palestine,"MOST PALESTINIANS are probably too young to remember when their president, Mahmoud Abbas, took power in 2005. He was elected to a four-year term, the first of two permitted by law. He never got round to holding another vote, yet he remains in charge, having served four times his mandate. Amazingly, he could soon win another term. On January 15th Mr Abbas announced the first elections in the occupied territories in more than 15 years. Many Palestinians were understandably sceptical. Calling for new elections is something of an annual tradition for Mr Abbas, who turned 85 in November. They never happen. Increasingly autocratic, Mr Abbas is loth to risk his grip on power. Perhaps he is more serious this time. Against the grain of years past, he has fixed dates for the elections, with a parliamentary ballot in May and a presidential one in July. But even if they happen they are unlikely to bring sweeping change: Mr Abbas could be the only viable candidate for president. His announcement does not reflect a desire for fresh faces or a new direction. Instead, it is a gesture to the new president in Washington. The Palestinians had a hard time with Donald Trump, to say the least; relations with America have not been this bad since the 1980s. Mr Abbas is eager to start anew with Joe Biden. Yet he is likely to be disappointed with the new administration, which has neither the time nor the inclination to wander down the cul-de-sac of Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy. In his effort to court the Americans, Mr Abbas may simply illustrate how bereft of ideas he is. Three out of four Palestinians support his call for elections. But they are not terribly enthusiastic about their choices. A survey conducted in December by Palestine’s leading pollster found that 66% of the public want Mr Abbas to resign. He would probably lose a race against Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls Gaza. It may not field a candidate, though. The group’s experiment with governance has been a disaster. Under blockade by Israel and Egypt, Gaza is an open-air prison where 2m people live in miserable conditions. Better to have Mr Abbas as a foil than to be responsible for the West Bank as well. There are few other credible challengers for the throne. Despite his advanced age, Mr Abbas has not designated a successor, and occasionally cuts down rivals within his nationalist Fatah party. The only name that excites voters is Marwan Barghouti, a prominent member of Fatah who would probably romp home to victory. But he would have to run from inside a jail cell. Mr Barghouti was convicted of murder by an Israeli court for organising attacks during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, and is serving multiple life sentences. As for parliament, it has been defunct for more than a decade, owing to a dispute between Hamas and Fatah. Asked who they would choose in a legislative election, 34% of Palestinians said Hamas and 38% Fatah (in the election of 2006 they won 44% and 41% of the vote, respectively). The rest opted for third parties or were undecided. A good showing could give Hamas a foothold in the West Bank, where both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) have long worked to suppress it. Many of the president’s own lieutenants are therefore opposed to holding elections now. The decision is an uncharacteristic risk for the stuffy Mr Abbas, one he hopes will leave him with a renewed mandate and a smidgen of goodwill in Washington. It is hard to remember now, but his relationship with Mr Trump began amicably. After their first meeting at the White House, in May 2017, Mr Abbas declared “with you, we have hope.” But there was an irreparable break in December of that year, when Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved America’s embassy there, breaking with decades of bipartisan consensus that it should remain in Tel Aviv. For the Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem should be resolved in a final peace agreement. They saw Mr Trump’s move as an effort to prejudge the outcome. Things went from bad to worse. In 2018 Mr Trump set out to halt all American aid to the Palestinians, including funds for the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees and for the Palestinian security forces that America helped train and equip. He also closed the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington. In 2020 he released a “peace plan” seen as hopelessly biased: it allowed Israel to keep about a quarter of the occupied West Bank. Last year Mr Abbas compounded his problems. Buoyed by Mr Trump’s plan, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, contemplated annexing parts of the West Bank. In protest, Mr Abbas stopped accepting transfers of tax revenue that Israel collects on the PA’s behalf. That cash covers 60% of the authority’s budget. Without it, many workers went unpaid or received only half their salaries. Some accepted this as a sacrifice for the greater good. In August, however, it became a needless sacrifice. Israel suspended talk of annexation in return for diplomatic ties with the United Arab Emirates, a decision that could bring economic dividends as well (see article). Mr Abbas, like many Palestinians, saw the Emirati move as a betrayal. He was unwilling to reverse his decision on the tax revenue without some diplomatic victory of his own. By the time he relented, in November, the Palestinian economy had suffered. Almost one in six Palestinians in the West Bank works for the government, in jobs that tend to pay better than the private sector. The unemployment rate in the West Bank rose from 13% in the third quarter of 2019 to 19% a year later. No surprise, then, that the Biden administration seems a breath of fresh air. The new president has already promised to renew aid to the Palestinians and restore diplomatic ties. Yet some of the hope in him is misplaced. For a start, Mr Biden will not reverse all his predecessor’s policies, as Tony Blinken, his secretary of state, made clear at his confirmation hearing. Asked if the administration recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and planned to keep America’s embassy there, he gave a succinct answer: “yes and yes”. Nor is the new president a miracle worker. He cannot end the schism between Palestinians nor reverse the hawkish tilt in Israeli politics. America has spent three decades trying to broker a deal between Israel and the Palestinians; well-intentioned presidents working in better circumstances have failed. Mr Biden’s inbox is filled to overflowing and his political capital is limited. The moribund peace process is unlikely to be a priority. Even many Palestinians would think it a wasted effort. Just 2% believe there is a good chance of securing their own state in the next five years. Most expect to be stuck with the status quo. They have differing ideas about how to break the impasse with Israel (see chart). A solid majority, 63%, backs a campaign of non-violent resistance. Pluralities agree with armed struggle (48%) and dissolving the PA (44%), while 29% support abandoning the two-state solution and pushing for a binational state that Arabs and Jews would share between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river. One can debate the merits of each path. Calls for a one-state solution would meet broad opposition in Israel. Even in the most amoral assessment, the violence of the second intifada was a strategic mistake, one that hardened public opinion against Palestinians both in Israel and overseas. These debates are common in the territories, in cafés, at conferences on social media—everywhere, it seems, but in the halls of power. Mr Abbas may win another four years in office. But he has nothing to offer except the same ideas that led nowhere over the previous sixteen. ■"
https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/02/23/the-ohio-train-derailment-is-turning-into-a-political-circus,"When your correspondent arrived in East Palestine, at around ten in the morning on February 22nd, the only person on Market Street, the town’s main drag, was Eric Walleck, holding a sign reading “Walleck 2024”. Sheltering from the rain under a shop’s awning, Mr Walleck explained that he had come from his home in Illinois to this part of eastern Ohio as part of his independent campaign to become president. “I came to talk to the citizens about the train wreck,” he said. “I’ve got food, I’ve got water in my truck, and I am going to hand it out.” He then admits that so far it hasn’t gone very well. “You’re the first person I have talked to,” he says. Later that day a rather better-known presidential candidate would appear in the town, also with plans to distribute food and water, and limited plans to speak to locals. By 1pm at least 100 people were gathered on Market Street awaiting the arrival of Donald Trump. Two stands had been set up to sell T-shirts, hoodies and flags. Dozens of journalists, YouTubers and TikTok influencers wandered up and down conducting interviews and performing pieces to camera. When Mr Trump finally arrived, just visible through the darkened tint of his SUV, the crowd cheered and broke into a chant of “Let’s Go Brandon”, a meme that means, roughly, “Fuck Joe Biden”. The proximate cause of this circus was a calamity that happened almost three weeks earlier. On February 3rd a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed in East Palestine, a town of a little less than 5,000 people on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Its cargo included dangerous chemicals such as vinyl chloride and butyl acrylate, both of which are used to create plastics. Apparently fearing an explosion, on February 5th Ohio state officials evacuated the town and then burned the spilled chemicals, creating an enormous black cloud over the place. A few days later residents were allowed to return. State and federal officials have declared that the local tap water is safe to drink and the air is safe to breathe. Yet few trust them. There are plenty of legitimate questions about the long-term impact of the chemicals that leaked into the local environment, and about the safety of freight trains in America. But it is a lack of trust in government that has turned a disaster into a political farce. Within days of the disaster right-wing political pundits were busy arguing that the town was not being paid enough attention because its residents are mostly white and voted for Mr Trump. One Fox News presenter suggested that the Environmental Protection Agency was happy with “spilling toxic chemicals on poor white people in Ohio” because it was a way of “fighting environmental racism”. Many people in the town share the feeling that they are being ignored. “Anybody who voted for Donald Trump doesn’t believe the government,” says Traci Ketchum, who lives just outside the town. “And here, that’s 71% of the population.” She says it is thrilling to see her home being discussed on Fox News, though she resents the assertion that its people are poor. Joy Mascher, who runs a florist on Market Street, says the government’s response was hardly quick enough. “The federal government has not stepped up,” she says. “Do we just not matter because we’re in the Rust Belt? This would not have happened in somewhere like Potomac, Maryland.” Mr Trump deftly exploited this sentiment. “You are not forgotten,” he told a small group of locals during his visit on February 22nd. He drew a contrast between his presence in Ohio and the whereabouts of President Joe Biden, who had been in Poland that day, after an earlier stop in Ukraine. Richard Lloyd, who lives around three miles away from where the train derailed, stood waiting for Mr Trump wearing a hazmat suit and a gas mask. “They should be giving these to everyone in this town,” he said. The air is far too unsafe to breathe, he observed, before removing his mask to light a cigarette. Will Mr Trump’s visit do anything to help (not counting the McDonald’s meals the former president purchased for firefighters and the bottles of water he donated)? It does seem to have kept attention on East Palestine. Hours before Mr Trump arrived there, Pete Buttigieg, the transport secretary, announced that he would come to the town the next day. Mr Buttigieg had earlier promised that his department would hold Norfolk Southern “accountable for any safety violations found to have contributed to the disaster”. The results of a preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board were also due to be published on February 23rd (after The Economist went to press). The Senate’s environment committee has pledged to investigate, too. Mr Trump claims none of that would have happened without his promise, made at the end of the previous week, that he would visit the place. Preventing another disaster like this will take more than Mr Trump’s brio. In recent decades the safety of American trains has in fact improved. Compared with a decade ago there are half as many incidents annually involving hazardous-material spills, and roughly 20% fewer derailments. But Ian Naish, a former safety inspector on Canadian railways, says he worries about the future. In recent years profits on the railways have soared, as firms have reduced their headcount and increased the length of trains. With railway safety, you have “got to have a continual chronic sense of unease,” he says. Because even if, overall, safety is improving, the next disaster might happen somewhere more densely populated than East Palestine. ■ Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."
https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2016/06/11/the-view-on-the-ground,"The Way to the Spring: Life and Death in Palestine. By Ben Ehrenreich. Penguin Press; 428 pages; $28. To be published in Britain by Granta in August; £14.99. IN THIS book of many stories, few of them happy, it falls to one young Palestinian to get the measure of things. A man puts out a sweet one day, he says. An ant comes to investigate, but finds it too heavy to carry home. So it leaves and returns with many ants; but meanwhile the man takes the sweet away. The ants look around a bit, and finding nothing, file off. The man then replaces the sweet, and the same ant finds it again. It races off to get the others, but before they can return, the man hides it again. Deceived a second time, the ants turn on the first ant and kill it. This is how, in Palestine, hopes can be crushed only so many times before they turn to despair and then rage. That anger is never far from the surface in “The Way to the Spring”, a new memoir by Ben Ehrenreich, an American writer. It draws on the many months he spent in the occupied West Bank, off and on, from the time of the Arab spring in 2011 to Israel’s bloody incursion into Gaza in 2014. Yet he also calls it a tale of love, and even of hope. Mr Ehrenreich is the author of two well-received novels (“Ether” and “The Suitors”) and he brings a novelist’s eye to his subject, framing the bulk of his book around one village, Nabi Saleh, 30 miles (48km) north-west of Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and around a group of a few dozen protesters, most of them confusingly from the same extended Tamimi family. The spring of the title is a real, not a metaphorical Arab spring; a water source used by the Tamimis and others in Nabi Saleh for many decades until, in 1976, the first Israeli settlers arrived and established a community they later called Halamish. Slowly Halamish expanded, as more and more of the land was taken, often for “military needs”, until in 2008 the spring itself was seized. In 2009 the villagers of Nabi Saleh began what became a long series of marches to their spring; they were opposed by armed settlers, and then by the Israeli army as well, which, the author recounts, fired tear-gas grenades, often directly at the protesters at face or chest height, and rubber-coated bullets. The Tamimis, and Mr Ehrenreich, make a point of always calling them that, not “rubber bullets”. Consisting of a thin layer of rubber around a steel core, a rubber-coated bullet can break a jawbone. It can penetrate the flesh. The Nabi Saleh marches, of course, achieved nothing. But they generated some media attention, and they drew activists and observers not just from Israel but from around the world. They have been, as Bassem Tamimi says, “a way to tell the world that we have the right to work our land…the spring is the face of the occupation, the occupation is illegal and we have the right to struggle against it.” It is in the author’s descriptions of the Tamimis that the hope, and the love, are to be found; the dedication day after day to an effort that yields only failure, sometimes arrest and injury, and even death; and the concern that the Tamimis share for each other, waiting outside detention centres and hospitals for news of a relative. This is also a cause for rage. As Mr Ehrenreich documents, the clan is divided over tactics. And there are much deeper divisions in Palestinian society as a whole. The government of Mahmoud Abbas, who succeeded Yasser Arafat as leader of the Fatah movement after the latter’s death in 2004, draws the hatred of many Palestinians for dealing with the Israelis, and for accepting that his Palestinian Authority gets to control only a fraction of the West Bank, even if the result is that the politically favoured of Ramallah get jobs and money. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a gold cage or an iron cage,” says Bassem. “It’s a cage.” And of course, many have it far worse than in Nabi Saleh. There is Sa’adat Sabri, as the book describes, who lives in a house completely fenced in by Israeli security barriers, with a gate he could go in and out of only when the authorities let him. And there is Hebron, the only city in the West Bank where Israelis still live, and where the Palestinian Arabs run a daily gauntlet of checks, searches and barriers. Many Israelis hate what their government does in the West Bank. But many, too, condone or support it for reasons ranging from fear of terrorism to mistrust of neighbouring Arab states and the conviction that the land from the river to the sea is theirs by right. They may well hate this book; there is little wider context in it, no attempt to investigate, or even to acknowledge, the other side. (One of the exceptions comes from an Israeli in Hebron, who says that “when someone wants to kill, we’ll kill him first…we’re not the religion that gives the second cheek to anyone.”) Mr Ehrenreich did not set out to write an objective book; he does not even think it is possible. This is simply a description, detailed and sometimes too much so, of what the facts on the ground look like if you are one of a particular group of Palestinians in the West Bank.

https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/10/how-the-term-genocide-is-misused-in-the-israel-hamas-war,"MANY GOVERNMENTS and citizens are appalled by the civilian casualties from Israel’s bombardment and invasion of Gaza, which is its response to Hamas’s attack on Israel. On October 10th the Palestinian envoy to the UN, Riyad Mansour, described Israel’s actions as “nothing less than genocidal”. Iran and Iraq have also accused Israel of genocide. Politically, it is clear why Israel’s enemies should invoke the heinous crime. But the allegation has also been made by countries that have usually been friendly to Israel. Colombia, Honduras and South Africa have all withdrawn their ambassadors from Israel, accusing its government of committing “genocide”. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Protesters and commentators in the West use the term too. “It is now clear that Israel is engaging in a genocide of the Palestinian people,” argued M. Muhannad Ayyash, a professor of sociology at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Canada. Craig Mokhiber, director of the New York office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, wrote on October 28th that “This is a text-book case of genocide.” Israel has both denied genocide and accused Hamas of the crime. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s permanent representative to the UN, said on October 26th that “This is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation.” What exactly is genocide, and how, if at all, is the term applicable to the current conflict? In December 1948, in the aftermath of the second world war, the UN adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The convention defines a genocide as acts intended “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Contrary to the common understanding of the term, the UN says not only killing counts. “Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction” does too, as does inflicting “serious bodily or mental harm”, “measures intended to prevent births”, and “forcibly transferring children of the group to another group”. Categorising atrocities as genocide has legal implications. The International Criminal Court is able to indict someone for the crime, for example. Interpretations of the convention differ because it is so broadly framed. So which atrocities constitute genocide? The systematic murder of 6m Jews by the Nazis was genocide. The organised butchery of perhaps 500,000 ethnic Tutsis by Hutu militias in Rwanda in 1994 was too. In both cases the intent, to destroy a people, was clear. Yet the case of Darfur, in Sudan, where about 300,000 people died in the years after fighting broke out there in 2003, is less clear. America called this a genocide. But in 2005 a UN commission concluded that Sudan’s government had “not pursued a policy of genocide” (although some individuals may have acted with “genocidal intent”). Donald Trump’s administration called the Chinese government’s treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang a genocide but others disagreed. This newspaper concluded that China’s persecution of the Uyghurs was “horrific”, but not genocidal.By the UN definition, Hamas is a genocidal organisation. Its founding charter, published in 1988, explicitly commits it to obliterating Israel. Article 7 states that “The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them”. Article 13 rejects any compromise, or peace, until Israel is destroyed. Hamas fighters who burst into Israel on October 7th and killed more than 1,400 Israelis (and other nationalities) were carrying out the letter of their genocidal law. Israel, by contrast, does not meet the test of genocide. There is little evidence that Israel, like Hamas, “intends” to destroy an ethnic group—the Palestinians. Israel does want to destroy Hamas, a militant group, and is prepared to kill civilians in doing so. And while some Israeli extremists might want to eradicate the Palestinians, that is not a government policy. Neither do the Israelis display any obvious intent to prevent Palestinian births. But those who accuse it of genocide point to the large number of civilians killed, at least 10,000 so far, and claim its blockade of the strip meets the “conditions-of-life” criterion. The Israelis have clearly inflicted “serious bodily or mental harm” on the Palestinians. They have also displaced people from the north of the strip. If those people are not allowed to return, this could be considered a partial destruction of their territory or, as Jan Egeland, a former UN head of humanitarian and relief efforts, has warned, a forcible population transfer. Even if an army’s actions do not pass the threshold of genocide, they can still be wrong. As the UN concluded during its report into Darfur, “crimes against humanity and war crimes that have been committed…may be no less serious and heinous than genocide”. ■"

https://www.economist.com/international/1999/12/16/palestines-shrinking-christians,"CHRISTIAN Palestinians are feeling bruised. The quarrel between their churches and Israel's Islamist movement over the building of a mosque in Nazareth has dented the belief that, among Palestinians, religion should take second place to nationalism—and reminded them how few their numbers have become. At the end of the 19th century, Christian Palestinians accounted for about 13% of the people in the Holy Land. Today they are 2%: 120,000 in Israel and a paltry 50,000 in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.  Israel's birth in 1948 forced waves of Palestinian refugees—some Christian, but mostly Muslim—to seek haven in the West Bank, turning Christian towns like Bethlehem and Ramallah into cities with Muslim majorities. After Israel's occupation of the West Bank in 1967, came hardships that spurred Palestinian Christians, a prosperous and well-educated group, to emigrate at twice the rate of Muslims. “When Muslims lose hope, they resort to fundamentalism, thus emigrating psychologically. When Christians lose hope, they emigrate geographically,” says Mitri Rahab, Bethlehem's Lutheran pastor. Some believed that the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) would stem both tides. Six years into the Oslo process, Christians are no longer so hopeful. Binyamin Netanyahu's government used to speak of the PA's “relentless persecution” of Christians. In fact, whatever Yasser Arafat's undoubted faults, sectarianism is not one of them and Christians tend to be more forgiving of their autocratic president than other Palestinians. The Christian fear is that a future Palestinian state will be Islamist, particularly in its laws and education. “I have no problem with Islam being the religion of the state of Palestine,” says Bernard Sabella, a sociologist at Bethlehem University. “I do have a problem with a religiously based state.” The omens are not encouraging. The national curriculum now being prepared for schools in the West Bank and Gaza equates the history of Palestine largely with the Islamic conquest of Palestine. The only “Christian” references concern the Crusades and Napoleon. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/11/23/decoding-donald-trumps-efforts-to-draw-a-road-map-for-israel-and-palestine,"PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP casts himself as a master negotiator. But when he talks of trying to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians, he often sounds less confident. It is a “complex subject”, the “toughest deal of all”, said Mr Trump in September. Still, he rates his chances of success as “very, very good”. A peace plan from the administration, expected in September, is now due in January. Mr Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner (pictured, centre), is leading the effort. He is being helped by Jason Greenblatt, the president’s envoy to the Middle East; David Friedman, the ambassador to Israel; and Dina Powell, a deputy national-security adviser. The first three are orthodox Jews who do not conceal their pro-Israel sympathies. Initially dismissed as neophytes, the team has won over sceptics with its willingness to listen. Even the Palestinians admire their readiness to take soundings in refugee camps, not just from politicians. They find the team more genial than Barack Obama’s “pen-pushers”. Mr Greenblatt, the chief negotiator, has opposed unilateral moves by Israel and welcomed the Palestinian reconciliation deal between the nationalist Fatah group (which controls the West Bank) and Hamas, an Islamist group (which holds sway in Gaza). The administration has been tight-lipped about the details of its plan, but those who have spoken to Mr Greenblatt describe it as more of a process—“a road map without a defined road”, says one Palestinian negotiator. The initial steps will probably be little more than confidence-building measures. The harder problems, such as drawing borders, returning refugees and resolving the status of Jerusalem, would be left until much later. It is not even certain that the endgame is two states, which most of the world has long demanded. Among the ideas being mooted is eventually to put Jewish settlements in the West Bank under Palestinian control. The lack of clarity is seen as a tactic aimed at keeping everyone on board. Whatever the administration produces, Saudi Arabia is likely to support it. Mr Kushner has struck up a friendship with Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. Though the prince’s foreign-policy record is not widely admired, he seems to have convinced Mr Kushner that he can help reshape the Middle East in ways that suit America. At Mr Trump’s behest he summoned the octogenarian Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to Riyadh earlier this month and urged him to embrace the American plan. Mr Abbas is seen by all sides (including his own) as plodding, time-serving and compromised. For Prince Muhammad, it seems, Palestinian aspirations to statehood are less important than countering Iran, which has extended its influence in the region. He has sought a closer relationship with Israel, which shares his dark view. There are reports that the Jewish state has shared intelligence with Saudi Arabia to help it in its war against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Prince Muhammad may calculate that a viable peace process would give him political cover to make the alliance more overt. Other Arab states also have an interest in restarting talks. Egypt under Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi has taken a more active role in the peace process and recently helped to end the feud between Hamas and Fatah. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates support Mr Sisi’s aim of cutting Hamas off from Iran and Qatar. Under a deal, they would probably fund development in Palestinian areas and furnish Israel with security guarantees. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has long seemed reluctant to negotiate with the Palestinians. But he might prefer an open-ended process to one with clear milestones and deadlines that would pin him down. He also wants to show gratitude to Mr Trump for not pushing him as hard as Mr Obama did. The Palestinians are also loth to alienate the Americans. But they fear being pushed into a deal that leaves Israel in military control of the West Bank. (The Israelis have already pushed for Hamas to be disarmed before the talks begin.) “Neither Netanyahu nor Abbas wants to insult the American plan, but neither has any real interest in it either,” says Jon Alterman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington, DC. In the region, officials rate the chances of success as very, very low. “They won’t find a way to make the circle square after so many others have tried,” says an Israeli diplomat. “Both sides are looking for ways to say no to Mr Trump,” says a Palestinian negotiator. On this, at least, they agree."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2011/09/24/the-war-over-statehood,"TO JUDGE by the vehemence of the arguments, the issue could be a matter of war or peace. “A UN vote on Palestinian membership would be ruinous,” says the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal claims that Palestinians are merely seeking “another tool in their perpetual campaign to harass, delegitimise and ultimately destroy Israel.” America's Congress has threatened to withdraw funds if Palestine is recognised as a state. Yet the Arabs have given equally dire warnings that if America casts a veto, its much-vaunted efforts to mend relations with the Arab and Muslim world will have been worthless. On September 16th Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, reiterated his determination to go directly to the Security Council to bid for full UN membership, knowing that the United States would veto it. But such a bid might be passed on to a committee within the council, where it could be stuck for years. The general guess is that, once rejected by the council, the only body that can confer full membership, Mr Abbas would seek a lesser version of membership in the UN General Assembly, where no veto can be wielded. That is where Europeans have been concentrating their efforts. Many favour the so-called “Vatican option” whereby Palestine would become an “observer state”: not a full member, but at least no longer a mere “entity”. Such a resolution, it is assumed, would include a reassertion that any final accord would recognise Israel and guarantee its security, and that the mutual border would be based on the 1967 line, with land swaps; that the states would share Jerusalem as their capital; and that the Palestinian refugee problem would be resolved. For their part, the Palestinians, under European prodding, would agree not to use their new-won statehood to launch prosecutions against Israelis at the International Criminal Court. The Americans would almost certainly vote against the Vatican option too, and their position would delight Israel's hard core of Jewish settlers in the West Bank (see article). Yet some liberal Israelis think a “moderate victory” may actually jolt the peace process into life. “If the Palestinians lose,” says one, “[Abbas] is finished. The winner will be Hamas [the harder-line Islamist movement that officially rejects Israel's existence and runs the Gaza Strip].” The Israeli government, however, argues that the Palestinian bid is a huge and potentially tragic mistake. “The only way to achieve a Palestinian state and peace is through direct negotiations,” says an Israeli official, adding that the Palestinians have not “seriously” engaged in talks for the past three years. The mistake would become “irrevocable”, he adds, if a resolution passed in the General Assembly prescribes a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. Palestinians respond that Mr Netanyahu is not ready to negotiate a two-state agreement. One of his demands, that the Palestinians must first recognise Israel as a Jewish state, seems intended merely to prevent talks restarting. Many Europeans and Americans wonder whether Mr Netanyahu is himself a dyed-in-the-wool rejectionist, or is simply in thrall to the ultra-nationalists in his coalition. The Israelis know that they will be heavily, indeed humiliatingly, outvoted in the General Assembly. A good two-thirds of the UN's 193 members will vote for Palestinian statehood. To increase the “moral minority”, as Mr Netanyahu calls it, Israel has been particularly keen to persuade the European Union collectively to vote against—or, failing that, at least to get Germany and Italy to vote no. But France and Spain seem minded to say yes, with Britain hovering in between (see Charlemagne). Israel's isolation has recently been underlined by the deterioration of its relations with Turkey and Egypt. Last month Turkey's government threw out Israel's ambassador and downgraded diplomatic ties. Then, this month, Israeli diplomats in Egypt were forced to flee when their embassy was attacked by demonstrators. More recently still, Israeli diplomats, fearing similar assaults, temporarily quit Jordan, the other Arab country with which Israel has a peace treaty. Israeli officials fear that the Palestinian move at the UN will spark new violence in the West Bank, after a long period of quiet. Co-operation between the Israeli army and Palestinian security forces loyal to Mr Abbas and his Palestinian Authority (PA) may, they think, become trickier. The PA hopes for large but peaceful demonstrations in support of its UN diplomacy. The Israelis say that, since nothing will change on the ground, Palestinian disappointment may boil over into violence. Back in the West Bank For many Palestinians, the UN bid feels like déjà vu. In 1999 Yasser Arafat declared he would secure full statehood, but backed off when Mr Netanyahu blocked him. “Two months ago, no one believed [Mr Abbas] would go to the UN in the face of American and Israeli pressure,” says the owner of an IT consultancy in Nablus, in the West Bank. “Saying no to a superpower is something big for us.” But Mr Abbas has outsmarted his internal as well as his external critics, and the latest opinion polls suggest that 83% of Palestinians in the territories back the UN bid. The Arab spring has changed the Palestinian political dynamic. Egypt's erstwhile president, Hosni Mubarak, often told the Palestinians publicly “to avoid endangering the peace process” by seeking statehood. The new Egyptian order, while it will be loth to break the peace treaty with Israel, will not take the Mubarak line. Turkey has hinted at compensating the Palestinians in the West Bank if America's Congress withholds funds. And on September 12th Prince Turki al-Faisal, a long-serving former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote that Saudi Arabia would “no longer be able to co-operate with America in the same way it historically has” if America votes against Palestinian statehood. Mr Abbas is winning praise for his boldness, yet problems dog him at home. For the past four years the PA's prime minister has been a technocrat, Salam Fayyad, who has much impressed the Western powers financing his fledgling government. But Mr Abbas has promised that, after his UN bid, he will restart talks on forming a government with Hamas, which loathes the secular Mr Fayyad. Indeed, Mr Abbas has also promised fresh elections, in the hope that, thanks to improvements on the West Bank, his Fatah group will win. It would be a supreme irony if, having won statehood on paper, Mr Abbas were again hobbled or even defeated by a party that still rejects the two-state solution."
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2002/10/10/post-1967-un-resolutions-relating-to-israel-palestine,"Resolution 252 (May 1968): All measures and actions taken by Israel with the aim of changing the legal status of Jerusalem, “including the expropriation of land and properties thereon are invalid and cannot change that status”.  Resolution 446 (March 1979): “The policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity.” Israel must “rescind its previous measures and...desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and, in particular, not...transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories.” Resolution 465 (March 1980) Israel's settlement policy constitutes “a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War”. It “calls upon all States not to provide Israel with any assistance to be used for settlements in the occupied territories”.  Resolution 471 (June 1980) re-emphasises the illegality of Israeli settlements and expresses concern “that Jewish settlers...are allowed to carry arms thus enabling them to perpetrate crimes against the civilian Arab population”.  Resolution 605 (December 1987), passed at the beginning of the first Palestinian intifada, deplores the “policies and practices of Israel which violate the human rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories”. Resolutions 607 (January 1988), 636 (July 1989), 694 (May 1991), 726 (January 1992) and 799 (December 1992) condemn Israel's deportation of Palestinian civilians from the occupied territories, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Resolution 904 (March 1994), after the massacre of Palestinian worshippers in Hebron by Baruch Goldstein, calls upon Israel to prevent illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers. It also demands measures to guarantee the safety of Palestinian civilians, including “a temporary international or foreign presence”, as provided for by the Oslo Accords.  Resolution 1322 (October 2000), passed soon after the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, “deplores the provocation carried out at al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem on September 28 2000” (the visit of Ariel Sharon, to emphasise Israel's sovereignty over the area), and the subsequent violence in the occupied territories.  Resolution 1405 (April 2002) expresses concern at “the dire humanitarian situation of the Palestinian civilian population”, particularly in Jenin refugee camp, and calls for “the lifting of restrictions imposed on the operations of humanitarian organisations”.  Resolution 1435 (September 2002) condemns “all terrorist attacks against civilians” and also demands “the expeditious withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces from Palestinian cities”."
https://www.economist.com/the-war-in-gaza-may-mark-a-watershed-for-the-palestinian-authority,"FOR MONTHS fears have been rising in Israel and among foreign governments that a surge in violence is in the offing in the West Bank. It is the area that Palestinians view as the core of a would-be state, which for decades has been occupied and overseen by Israel’s government in tandem with the Palestinian Authority (PA), the nearest thing to a local Arab administration. It was thought that the increasing brutality shown towards Palestinians by Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank might spark an uprising, or intifada. Now the war in Gaza adds a new dimension to the situation: Hamas says one motivation for its attack on Israel is to inspire a broader uprising across the West Bank that overthrows the feeble pa. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas On October 12th Israel’s government told roughly 1.1m Gazans, half of the territory’s population, to flee to its southern half. It is widely assumed that this heralds a military invasion of Gaza’s northern half. That could catalyse more outbreaks of unrest on the West Bank. After Hamas’s initial murderous assault on October 7th, tensions soared. On October 11th and 12th Israeli settlers shot dead six Palestinians in the West Bank village of Qusra. In clashes on the West Bank, Israeli security forces and settlers have shot and killed a total of 52 Palestinians since the Hamas attack. Though the bloodshed is nothing like as extreme as that around Gaza, the death toll is already high even by the West Bank’s grim standards. The situation there is not yet out of control, but it is edging that way. Even as Hamas’s assault from Gaza was still unfolding, celebrations erupted in the West Bank’s cities. Hundreds of people paraded through the centre of Ramallah, waving the green flags of Hamas. This is the seat of the PA, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas and his secular Fatah party, which is Hamas’s sworn rival and was kicked out of Gaza by it 16 years ago.  In Nablus and Jenin, two of the West Bank’s other main cities, masked militants and civilians in their hundreds gathered in the streets to praise the attack. Some handed out sweets. Others posed for pictures with rifles. The key question is how the Palestinians of the West Bank will respond to the mounting bloodshed in Gaza, as Israel bombs it from the air and prepares for a ground attack into the densely populated enclave. Most West Bank Palestinians sympathise with the plight of their Gazan cousins. Hamas remains stubbornly popular in both Palestinian territories. Tension in the West Bank tends to rise whenever clashes with Israel forces erupt in either territory. “We’d prefer Hamas not to do it [attack Israel],” says a PA official. “But when Israel responds, it is not seen as an attack against Hamas, but as part of a 75-year-long war on the Palestinian nation.” Israel is trying to keep a lid on the West Bank with heavy policing. Even the short drive between Nablus and Ramallah is now pocked with checkpoints. Yet Israel’s armed forces are already stretched thin across several fronts: not just around Gaza but also on the border with Lebanon. There the Israelis have already exchanged fire with Hizbullah, an Iranian-backed militia that is armed with well over 100,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel. A wide eruption of violence and unrest in the West Bank on the scale of the last major intifada there, which lasted from 2000-2005 and claimed about 3,000 Palestinian and 1,000 Israeli lives, would stretch Israel’s forces even more thinly across a third front. The more than 3m Palestinians who live in the West Bank are wealthier and have much more to lose than those in Gaza. Few of those who lived through the last intifada want to see a repetition of its death and destruction. Many Palestinians in the territory rely on the salaries of family members who work in Israel, with which the West Bank’s economy is entwined. Hence the Palestinians of the West Bank have shown little desire to confront Israel directly, however much they may loathe the Israeli occupation. In the past couple of years new militant groups have emerged from the West Bank’s hotbeds of discontent, especially in Nablus and the Jenin refugee camp. They have come out vociferously in support of the Hamas attack. But they have not yet sent out their fighters in force against Israeli targets in the West Bank, partly because they are conscious that Israel still has very much the upper hand there. Still, a wave of attacks or killings of West Bank Palestinians by Israeli settlers, such as those that occurred in Qusra, might well push large numbers of Palestinians and their new militant groups into open revolt. The PA is desperate to avoid this third intifada, because it would undermine its very existence. The PA’s survival depends largely on its co-operation with Israel on almost every matter, ranging from security to the granting of work permits to Palestinians in Israel. An open confrontation with Israel could destroy the PA. Yet on the other hand it cannot bring itself to condemn Hamas’s recent onslaught. The PA fears that doing so would be seen as opposing what the Palestinians hail as their resistance to Israel’s occupation and would drain what little credibility it still has on the Palestinian street. Even before the Hamas attack, the sclerotic PA was in crisis. Donor fatigue and local mismanagement have left it struggling to pay the salaries of public employees in recent months. Mr Abbas has repeatedly cancelled elections, further reducing his legitimacy. And the PA has been unable to protect Palestinians from Israeli settler violence, which has increased since last year’s formation of a far-right government by Binyamin Netanyahu. Last month 87% of Palestinians told the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah that the PA was corrupt. The bloodbath caused by Hamas will add to the PA’s woes. On October 9th the European Commission said it was reviewing annual funds worth almost €691m ($728m) that it gives to the Palestinians. The governments of Austria and Germany announced similar reviews of their aid. One of the few cards Mr Abbas has to play is his recently warming relations with Saudi Arabia, something Palestinian officials have put much hope in. On October 10th Mr Abbas telephoned Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, urging him to become a mediator in order to protect civilians in Gaza. A day later the prince spoke for the first time to Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi. The prospect of Saudi Arabia getting involved as a mediator is, however, a long shot. If Mr Abbas fails to get support from European donors or the Saudis, let alone the Israelis, the PA could face a financial crisis so deep that the PA’s security forces, which are supposed to police parts of the West Bank, may collapse. The result would be chaos and perhaps even open the door to a takeover of the West Bank by Hamas or other militant factions. It would also mean an end to the PA’s security co-operation with Israel, which would lead to more frequent Israeli raids, a more intrusive security presence and probably much greater bloodshed. The war in Gaza marks a watershed for the PA. It has no easy choices. Either it can maintain its current refusal to condemn Hamas and risk being cut off by its foreign donors and friends, which could lead to its total collapse. Or it can come out firmly against it in the hope of regaining international support but at the risk of enraging so many Palestinians on the street that they sweep the PA aside. Mr Abbas tends to avoid making decisions, let alone such tough ones. The odds are that he will try to muddle through with equivocation, hoping that the PA can survive long enough to see Hamas, its main rival, crushed in Gaza by Israel. ■"
https://www.economist.com/letters/2007/03/01/on-global-warming-europes-future-anna-nicole-smith-visas-israel-and-palestine-transporting-cash-the-romans,"SIR – Your article on the fourth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the range of the IPCC's predictions of the rise in temperature by 2100 “leaves plenty of scope for argument about whether it is worth trying to do anything about climate change” (“Heating up”, February 10th). This misinterprets the IPCC's report, which presents best estimates of the rise in temperature between 2000 and 2100 for several different emission scenarios. The lowest emission scenario (range 1.1-2.9°C) would probably warm the planet by 1.8°C. The best estimate for the highest emission scenario is a rise of 4.0°C (range 2.4-6.4°C).  The provision of ranges for each emission scenario actually represents a significant reduction in uncertainty compared with the IPCC's third report. The key point is that the amount of global warming depends on which emission path we choose. When the new estimates are added to the 0.6°C of warming that has happened during the 20th century, the fourth report shows that it is indeed worth doing something. Even if we choose the lowest emission path we can expect warming of about 2.4°C by 2100, relative to pre-industrial times. Given that warming greater than 2°C puts us at risk of irreversible changes to the climate system, our path of action is clear: we must ensure our output of greenhouse gases is under the range of the lowest emission scenario and well below “business as usual”. Sean Nixon  Sierra Legal Vancouver SIR – Charlemagne believes there are “only two basic types” for a multi-speed Europe (“Coalitions for the willing”, February 3rd). “Multi-speed” suggests Helmut Kohl's idea of a convoy with some catching up later on. The first type, the idea of concentric circles advocated by Mr Kohl's adviser, Michael Mertes, is based on the assumption that there would be one legal framework but that some could join later or alternatively remain on the margin. The second type assumes that there would be a centre of gravity around the single market but within a framework that assumes the acquis, the body of European Union law and regulations, and again a central legal framework. Both of these create a second-class membership, which is wholly unacceptable. Both “enhanced co-operation” (a legal term of art) and “variable geometry” suffer from the assumption of an overarching legal order and an acquis set in concrete.  A “multi-dimensional”, rather than multi-speed, approach would be more appropriate. As you point out, the EU at present subscribes in theory to a system that does not exist or work in practice, but there is clearly another way. A far better formula is an association of nation states along the lines of the European Free Trade Area. The world has moved on since the EU was originally conceived and the case for an association of nation states is now stronger than ever. Multi-dimensional, not multi-speed. Bill Cash, MP House of Commons London SIR – I have long considered the influential lives portrayed in your weekly obituary to comprise a deserving, exclusive club, to which I could only aspire. However, now that you have immortalised the “pneumatic” Anna Nicole Smith (Obituary, February 17th), who was unskilled, uneducated and untalented, and despite her having absolutely no impact on the global economy, world politics or the advancement of the human species, it is clear that I must set my sights higher, or engineer bigger breasts. Donna Anton Hayle, Cornwall SIR – I am dismayed that you followed the tabloids by devoting a page to Ms Smith and acquiesced in her life-long wish to be compared to the incomparable Marilyn Monroe.  Melissa Perez Ann Arbor, Michigan  SIR – Allow me to add a few facts to your article on the “disquiet” over visa restrictions on visitors to the United States (“Keeping out more than terrorists”, February 10th). Applicants for visas receive an appointment within 15 days at 80% of our diplomatic posts and we are aggressively reducing backlogs at the rest. Once approved, 97% of visas are issued within two days of the interview; half of the remainder are issued within two weeks.  All diplomatic posts expedite student and business visas, often in conjunction with the local American Chamber of Commerce. The result? You correctly noted that 12% more business visas were issued last year than in 2005, but the figure is even higher in some countries such as Brazil, China and South Korea. We've created 570 consular positions to handle the growing demand and more are on the way. Welcoming foreign visitors is critical to this country's economy and national image; the best advertisement for America is America.  Maura Harty Assistant secretary for consular affairs State Department Washington, DC SIR – As you say, in order to lift its boycott the Western world has set three sensible conditions on the Palestinian Authority (“A holy but puzzling alliance”, February 17th). But when will we set the same three conditions on Israel: to recognise Palestine, to renounce violence and to keep their side of previous agreements? How can we expect peace in the Middle East when we boycott the Palestinians yet reward Israel with billions of dollars of aid when both sides are ignoring the basic preconditions for peace? The conditions are simple. Apply them equally to both sides and peace will have a chance.  Kamal Hassan Toronto SIR – I was interested to read that there were 700 raids on cash-transport vehicles in Britain in 2005 (“We were Heros”, February 10th). In the 1930s I worked opposite a bank in the City of London. From time to time a horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top would pull up outside the bank. The driver would remain in his seat while a lad got out to lower the tailgate so that the bank's employees could meander out with gold bricks and place them in the wagon. The lad then closed the tailgate, climbed back into the wagon and off it went. A policeman standing nearby while the loading was being done would then wander off. How times have changed.  Brian Lowe Rosebud, Australia SIR – The idea of recruiting foreigners to serve in an army has a long tradition (“The green-card brigade”, February 3rd). The Romans recruited men-at-arms from border tribes to defend their empire and found that when given citizenship, the tribesmen were more Roman than the Romans and became very enthusiastic about fighting their former brethren.

https://www.economist.com/britain/2014/10/18/a-state-of-things-to-come,"IN HIS declaration of 1917 giving Britain’s backing for the creation of a Jewish homeland, Arthur Balfour, the then foreign secretary, undertook to uphold the civil and religious rights of the native population of Palestine. A century later after less than total success, Britain’s Parliament added national rights as well. On October 13th it voted by 274 votes to 12 to recognise a Palestinian state. On the face of it, the backbench vote will have little impact. It is not binding, sets no deadline for recognition and will not change government policy, says David Cameron, the Conservative prime minister. Over half of MPs abstained. But as a barometer of European sentiment, the vote is telling. Since last summer’s Gaza war and recent appropriations of Palestinian land, even Israel’s allies have found its actions hard to stomach. “If it is losing people like me, it is going to be losing a lot of people,” said Richard Ottaway, the pro-Israel chairman of Parliament’s foreign affairs committee. To downplay the significance of the vote, Mr Cameron abstained. Yet this might also reflect growing ambivalence towards Israel, some claimed. After siding with Israel early in the Gaza war, Mr Cameron denounced Israel’s post-war landgrab as “utterly deplorable”. That growing concern has had little discernible impact on relations. Bilateral trade has risen 28% year-on-year. And Israel can be thick-skinned about how the world views it. “There’s a bit of a tendency to write off Europeans as Nazi-hugging anti-semites,” says a Western diplomat in Tel Aviv. But the vote may encourage others in Europe to do more than just urge the parties to end Israel’s occupations by negotiation, as they have for 23 years. Earlier this month, Sweden’s new prime minister, Stefan Lofven, said his country, too, would recognise a Palestinian state. And when the issue of Palestinian UN membership next comes to the Security Council, as it may soon, the parliamentary vote might make it a bit harder for Britain to oppose it."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/06/27/an-underwhelming-start-to-the-ultimate-israeli-palestinian-deal,"IT COULD HAVE been Davos, or any other conference on the annual circuit for the world’s wealthy. Jared Kushner, the son-in-law and adviser to America’s president, took the stage in Manama to offer his vision for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The combatants, he lectured, were “trapped in an inefficient framework of the past”. The IMF director suggested looking at best practices from Mozambique. During a surreal segment on property rights, which lie at the very heart of the conflict, the moderator mused about using blockchain for Palestinian land deeds. Before he took office in 2017 Donald Trump vowed to broker the “ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians. To oversee the effort he chose Mr Kushner, a property developer with no experience in diplomacy or the Middle East. The result has been roughly as expected. There is still no plan for resolving the underlying conflict and its many thorny issues: borders, refugees, the status of Jerusalem, or the very notion of Palestinian statehood. Its release has been repeatedly delayed. Diplomats hint that it may remain on the shelf until Mr Trump’s second term, if he wins one. Instead Mr Kushner organised this two-day confab in Bahrain. Dubbed the “Peace to Prosperity” workshop, the centrepiece was a 96-page plan that pledged $50bn-worth of investment in Palestine and neighbouring countries after a peace deal. The document is impressive in scope. It suggests projects to boost agriculture and tourism, fix Palestine’s infrastructure and improve governance. All of this would be funded by a mix of grants, concessional loans and private money. Missing amid all this detail was anything about the Israeli occupation, in its various forms, of the West Bank and Gaza, or about the schism between the Palestinian leaders in the two territories. The plan presupposes that the Holy Land’s noxious politics have simply vanished. Mr Kushner would spend $5bn to connect the West Bank and Gaza, for example. Israel has promised to do this for years but never has, because the link is not simply a matter of building a monorail: it raises complex political and security questions. The $2bn plan to give Palestine 5G wireless infrastructure would thrill entrepreneurs, but there was no mention of how to overcome objections from the Israeli army, which let the West Bank have 3G only last year, a decade after the rest of the world. None of the speakers in Bahrain commented on this dissonance, perhaps because few were familiar with the conflict, or even its geography. To estimate the cost of installing 5G in Palestine, the president of AT&T compared it with Mexico, which he said was five to ten times as big (it is in fact 316 times larger). As it stands, the plan is thoroughly unrealistic. That is the point, Mr Kushner’s supporters argue. It is meant to offer the Palestinians a peace dividend, an incentive to accept his (perhaps) forthcoming political vision. They certainly need the help. Unemployment in the West Bank is 17%. In Gaza it is more than 50%. Adjusted for inflation, GDP per person is almost unchanged from 20 years ago. But to the Palestinians this smells like a bribe from a hostile president. Mr Trump cut all American aid to them. He overturned decades of precedent to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. And aides hint that the political plan will give the Palestinians far less than the sovereign state along the pre-1967 borders that they demand. So they decided to boycott the workshop. Their president, Mahmoud Abbas, refused to send anyone from his government. “The deal of shame will go to hell,” he said in May. The private sector also declined invitations. Arab states were thus reluctant to share a stage with Israeli officials—who were not invited in the end, though some Israeli businessmen did come. Reporters from six Israeli outlets sent fawning dispatches. The country’s largest newspaper, Israel Hayom, which backs both Mr Trump and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, dubbed Bahrain the “island of hope”, an odd appellation for a kingdom that crushed a popular uprising in 2011. And that, perhaps, points to the real outcome of the workshop. It was the most public manifestation of a long and mostly private rapprochement between Israel and the Gulf states, one the Trump administration is keen to promote. The event did nothing to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it was another sign that the Gulf states are looking to move past it. Though they are not quite ready to recognise Israel, they see it as an ally against a shared threat from Iran. The Palestinians have far less to offer. “All we have is our moral power,” says Mkhaimer Abu Saada, a political analyst in Gaza. That still counts for something—but less and less each passing day. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/10/26/the-balfour-declaration-still-offers-lessons-to-israel-and-the-palestinians,"IN OCTOBER 1917, in the depths of the first world war, an expectant Chaim Weizmann was waiting in a London anteroom. Britain’s war cabinet was voting on a document, now known as the Balfour Declaration, that would pledge Britain’s support for Zionists’ hopes of statehood in Ottoman-ruled Palestine. Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, rushed out to share the good news: “Weizmann, it’s a boy!” But the 67-word declaration was vague. It offered a Jewish “homeland”, not a state. Nor did Britain explain how it would be created, promising only “best endeavours” to do so. The Zionist leader’s first reaction was disappointment. The boy “was not the one I had expected,” he later wrote. A century on, his successors have no such doubts. On November 2nd Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, will attend a dinner in London to celebrate the document’s centenary. Theresa May, the British prime minister, will join him. So will Lord Balfour, a descendant of the man who lent his name to the letter. In Jerusalem, the Knesset will hold a special session. The British Museum may lend Israel the original letter to put on display. Yet Weizmann was right to be sceptical. Britain, mired in war, was unsure how to handle Palestine. Some officials wanted to offer a homeland to the Jews, in part because they hewed to the anti-Semitic trope that Jews were influential enough to bring America into the war and flip the Ottomans to the Allied side. And British diplomats made contradictory promises to the Sherif of Mecca and the French. Mr Weizmann believed that the support of world powers, particularly Britain, would be enough to create a Jewish homeland. At the time Jews made up less than 10% of the population in Palestine. They lacked the resources or the strength to establish a state. With time, Britain would obstruct the Zionist project. To quell an Arab revolt it published a white paper in 1939 that capped Jewish immigration to Palestine and stated “unequivocally” that it should not become a Jewish state. By then, however, the Jewish community had organised itself, forming militias, a parliament and a nascent government. When the UN voted in 1947 to partition Palestine, the Jews already had the trappings of their state. “What matters is not what the goyim [gentiles] say, but what the Jews do,” said David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister. That history is still relevant. An ascendant Israeli right wants more settlements in the lands that Israel occupied in 1967, more restrictions on left-wing NGOs, more efforts to limit “liberal” institutions like the courts and the media. It claims not to care about the world’s opinion—and to be fair, much of the world does not have one. Israel’s emerging allies in Africa and Latin America see a vibrant high-tech sector and useful military co-operation. In July Mr Netanyahu welcomed Narendra Modi to Jerusalem, the first-ever visit by an Indian prime minister. Though only Egypt and Jordan have recognised Israel, other Arab states, particularly in the Gulf, now have quiet alliances with their one-time foe. Despite Ben-Gurion’s maxim, the celebrations in London and Jerusalem will be a reminder that Israel still craves moral affirmation. The then Lord Balfour saw Israel in emotional terms, a state owed to the Jews because of “age-old traditions and present needs.” That sentiment still looms large. Palestinians, for their part, call his letter the first of many betrayals by the world. Last year Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, threatened to sue Britain unless it recognised Palestine and apologised for the declaration. He has spent much of this decade trying to win international recognition; in a sense, he has become an unlikely heir to Mr Weizmann’s brand of Zionism. Palestine won observer status at the UN in 2012, and most countries in the world now recognise it as a state. Yet it is no closer to independence than it was in 1967. Mr Abbas’s corrupt, sclerotic government has spent much of the past decade feuding not with Israel but with its own people. Perhaps the Balfour Declaration has a lesson for the Palestinians as well: Britain did not create Israel—and nor will another foreign power create Palestine. If there is to be an end to a century of conflict, it will have to come from within."
https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/08/suella-braverman-uses-a-pro-palestinian-march-to-sow-discord,"Armistice day commemorates several things, none of which means that protests against Israel’s bombardment of Gaza should not take place on that day—and some of which suggest they should. Held every year on the anniversary of the truce that ended the first world war on November 11th 1918, Armistice Day remembers those who have died in service since 1914. It also celebrates a victory over forces that would have denied Britons vital freedoms, including the right to protest. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, nonetheless wants to stop a pro-Palestine march due to take place in London on November 11th. She has described it as a “hate march” that displays “thuggish intimidation and extremism”. If her words were intended to foment division, they have succeeded. Some far-right agitators have in recent days urged supporters to “defend” the Cenotaph, a monument to the war dead in central London. That may have prompted the Metropolitan Police to urge organisers of the march to cancel it. Yet on November 7th Sir Mark Rowley, the Met’s commissioner, also made it clear he would not bow to political pressure. The march did not pose enough of a threat of serious public disorder for him to seek a ban under the Public Order Act of 1986, he said. He stressed the importance of an “independent police service…focused simply on the law and the facts in front of us”. Sir Mark pointed out that the planned march’s route goes nowhere near the Cenotaph: it will begin at Hyde Park, about a mile away, and end at the American embassy in Vauxhall, south of the Thames. Armistice Day this year takes place a day before Remembrance Sunday, the main commemoration of Britain’s war dead, when a ceremony is held at the Cenotaph itself. One of the chief organisers of the march, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (psc), which was established in 1982 and has held largely peaceful marches for the past four Saturdays, has scheduled the demonstration to begin two hours after the two-minute silence on the morning of November 11th. The psc has also had regular meetings with the Met to discuss security. There are genuine concerns about rising anti-Semitism in Britain, as elsewhere. In London posters of hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th, when the terrorist group murdered 1,400 people, have been torn down. Some of the chants of those protesting against Israel’s bombing of Gaza are brazenly anti-Semitic. They include “From the river to the sea”, which is a call for the destruction of Israel, whether all those who repeat it understand that or not. The police do have powers to deal with hate-fuelled protesters. In addition to allowing the police to ask the government to ban a march, the Public Order Act also allows police to detain anyone who causes “harassment, alarm or distress”. The Met has already arrested several apparent supporters of Hamas, the political wing of which was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the government in 2021 (the military wing was proscribed in 2001). But Sir Mark has previously suggested that, although the law is clear on terrorism offences, there is “scope to be much sharper” on extremism. That was “creating a gap”. Looking to see whether laws need tightening up is reasonable. But curbing the right to protest is a mistake. Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians. Ms Braverman’s incendiary language has not been echoed by others in government. Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, said that the right to protest is “what makes us a fair and free country”. Yet he and other Tories have also urged the march not to go ahead. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, has said that Sir Mark would be held accountable for his decision. More conflict lies ahead. Pro-Palestinian activists seem unlikely to let up on protests. And in a piece for the Times this week, the home secretary doubled down, again branding demonstrators as “hate marchers” and accusing the police of being softer on protesters “favoured by the left”. The police have a hard enough job without Ms Braverman stirring the pot. ■ For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas,"IN THE EARLY hours of October 7th Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist organisation that runs Gaza, launched more than 2,000 rockets towards Israel. Over a thousand Hamas fighters, some in motorised gliders, crossed the border between Israel and Gaza. They attacked civilians on the streets of small Israeli towns and in their homes. In the next 48 hours they killed more than 900 Israelis, a figure far surpassing the deaths in the previous 19 years of conflict, and took around 150 hostages. Israel was caught off guard partly because Hamas had never carried out such a large attack. The country’s defence establishment had assumed that in recent years Hamas had decided to refrain from wide-scale confrontation—and that its capacity to do so was limited. They were wrong. Just how powerful is Hamas? Hamas was founded in 1987 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian cleric, during the first intifada, when thousands of Palestinians fought against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Yassin, who had joined the Muslim Brotherhood, the world’s oldest Islamist movement, in Cairo, intended Hamas to be the Brotherhood’s political spin-off in Gaza. In its first charter, published in 1988, the “Islamic Resistance Movement”—“HMS” are its initials in Arabic—proclaimed its duty to liberate Palestine from Israel, which it declared illegitimate. It carried out its first attacks on Israeli military targets in 1989 and formally established a military wing in the early 1990s. It expressed its opposition to the Oslo accords, which were aimed at establishing peace between Israel and the Palestinians, by carrying out suicide-bombings within Israel. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas: At first the group was weak both politically and militarily. But its political strength among Palestinians grew. In 2006, a year after Israel withdrew from Gaza, Hamas won a majority of seats in a Palestinian election and later formed a new unity government with Fatah, its nationalist rival. In June 2007, after a brief civil war, it assumed sole control of Gaza, leaving Fatah to run the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank. In response Israel and Egypt imposed a suffocating blockade on the coastal strip in 2007, strangling its economy and in effect confining its people in an open-air prison. There have been no elections since. Hamas has run Gaza as an oppressive one-party state, leaving some Palestinians there disenchanted with its leadership. Nevertheless Palestinians widely consider it to be more competent than the ailing, corrupt PA. Despite the blockade, Hamas was able to slowly build its military capacity. By 2008, when the group began its first war against Israel, it had developed a military structure and trained thousands of fighters, with smuggled support from Iran, Syria and Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, and had been launching makeshift rockets for a year. But the rocket attacks achieved little militarily, and Israel’s subsequent strikes on Gaza killed an estimated 1,200-1,400 Palestinians. Hamas has innovated since then. In 2014, when it began its third war against Israel (after a second in 2012), it had a much wider range of combat capabilities. Its rockets had grown in number and range and it had got better at concealing its military infrastructure. It developed a system of offensive tunnels into Israel, and another through which it transported weapons from Egypt. It increased the efficiency of its ground combat forces, who continued fighting for 50 days. By 2021 Hamas was able to fire 4,300 rockets at Israel in an 11-day burst. (In 2014 it had fired around 4,500 in 50 days.) But Hamas was still no match for its foe. After its barrages in 2021 killed a dozen people, Israel’s retaliatory jets and helicopters pummelled an already decrepit Gaza, killing over 200. For two years Hamas avoided escalating the conflict with Israel. That led many to wrongly assume that the dominant forces within the group’s leaders were focusing on bolstering their rule in Gaza. But the attack on October 7th was far more sophisticated than any that came before it. Hamas attacked Israel’s sensors and disabled its security cameras. It made use of advanced electronic warfare and jammed Israeli communications systems, according to a report by Reuters. All this would suggest that Hamas has been bolstering its military technologies for some time, with at least some outside support, possibly from Iran. Hamas was able to launch its attack despite a huge asymmetry: Israel’s Defence Forces far outweigh it, in both numbers and equipment. Israel puts Hamas’s military force at about 30,000 fighters; Israel on Monday called up 300,000 reservists, to add to its 170,000 or so active soldiers. The IDF’s much larger arsenal includes missile boats and tanks. The 2m civilians in Gaza will be preparing for the worst. ■"
https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/06/24/labour-could-lose-a-by-election-over-the-issue-of-palestine,"GEORGE GALLOWAY is sitting in Starbucks, close to the abandoned nightclub that serves as his campaign base. “Fighting Labour is our number one target,” he declares. An MP for Labour before he was expelled in 2003, Mr Galloway is a political opportunist with a habit of causing trouble at tricky moments. He handed Labour surprise defeats in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005, and Bradford West in 2012. On July 1st, standing in Batley and Spen for a new Workers Party of Britain (founded to “defend the achievements of the USSR, China, Cuba etc”), he may cause a third upset, albeit by splitting Labour’s vote rather than by winning himself. Labour has held the seat since 1997. The candidate, Kim Leadbeater, is the sister of Jo Cox, who was its MP until she was murdered in 2016 by a white-supremacist terrorist. Ms Leadbeater’s energy, charisma and work for the foundation set up in her sister’s memory are in her favour. But polling suggests rising support for the Conservatives. And much of Mr Galloway’s projected 6% vote share is likely to come from South-Asian Muslims who feel slighted and ignored by Labour. The constituency is a complex mixture. The small, prosperous towns of Spen Valley largely vote Tory. Batley, by contrast, is an old mill town filled with working-class white and South-Asian Muslims. It is rundown, with many of the handsome sandstone buildings in the centre lying empty. Leave the centre, and cobbled streets give way to potholed tarmac. Locals complain about fly tipping, too few school places and the closure of Batley police station. Such gripes usually harm incumbents—and Labour holds not just the constituency but also a plurality on the county council. Ms Leadbeater joined Labour only recently (she felt that party membership conflicted with her charity work), which may help neutralise the anti-incumbency effect. But it has also stirred resentments. Some local Muslims think a Labour candidate should have been chosen from among their community’s councillors. Some of those councillors are rumoured to be campaigning for Mr Galloway. Inter-communal relations can be rocky. Residents, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, lament increasing self-segregation. Ms Cox was murdered by a white supremacist; far-right groups frequently demonstrate in the area and several are running in this election. In May a teacher at Batley Grammar School was forced into hiding by death threats after he showed a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad in a lesson on blasphemy. He is still in hiding. Internal Labour politics do not help. Sir Keir Starmer, the party’s leader, has tried to tackle the anti-Semitism that flourished under Jeremy Corbyn, his predecessor. But many of Batley’s Muslims feel he has nothing to say about their grievances, or about Islamophobia. They are angered, too, by his refusal to condemn Israel’s recent bombing of Gaza. All this is meat and drink to Mr Galloway, whose other pet cause, besides a fondness for anti-Western dictatorships, is Palestine. From 2012 to 2015 he was MP for nearby Bradford West, standing for the Respect Party, a coalition of far-left and Islamist groupuscules. He claims Muslims like him because he helped organise an aid convoy to Palestine in 2008-09, and more generally because of his pro-Palestinian stance and rhetoric. Doubtless true, but Mr Galloway also evokes uglier sentiments. He once blamed a scandal on the “New York-Tel Aviv axis of evil”. Some of his supporters talk of the “powerful lobbies” that made Sir Keir party leader. Soon the words “Jewish” and “Zionist” are uttered, along with references to politicians “selling their souls” on the issue of Palestine. Mr Galloway promises his supporters that a defeat for Labour in Batley and Spen will force Sir Keir to step down as party leader. That may be an exaggeration. But there is no doubt that another loss, after Labour’s shock defeat in a by-election in May in Hartlepool, which elected its first-ever Conservative MP, would seriously damage Sir Keir. Hartlepool was one of the “Red Wall” constituencies across the middle and north of England that used to vote Labour, but plumped for Brexit in 2016 and are now tilting Conservative. That loss emphasised how hard it will be for Labour to keep both the northern, pro-Brexit working class and the southern, anti-Brexit graduates it needs to have any chance in a general election. Losing Batley and Spen would be a sign that a modest but important part of Labour’s multi-ethnic coalition is also at risk. In this constituency and perhaps others, Israel, Palestine and anti-Semitism may function like Brexit: as a wedge issue that prises off one group of traditional Labour voters, stirring up dangerous divisions in the process. ■"
https://www.economist.com/letters/2006/08/24/on-joe-lieberman-israel-and-palestine-kazakhstan-hong-kong-women-and-men,"SIR – It was not only anti-war lefties and doves that gravitated away from Joe Lieberman in Connecticut's Democratic primary but also hawkish “Joe Biden” Democrats such as myself (“An anti-war centre begins to hold”, August 12th). I did admire Mr Lieberman for a long time, and he is by no means the only Democrat to think the Iraq war is the right course of action to take. However, his unapologetic support for George Bush's conduct of the war and the administration's violation of civil liberties and disregard for America's tradition in international justice (coupled with the fact that he buys into the Republican mantra that criticism of the government is unpatriotic) were just too much for most Democrats. Mr Lieberman needed to be put in check.  Michael Williams Head, Transatlantic Programme, Royal United Services Institute  London SIR – Your prescription for a solution to America's foreign policy problems in the Middle East asks the United States to put pressure on both Israel and the Palestinians to achieve peace (“Lost in the Middle East”, August 12th). The last time America tried this it came up with a comprehensive peace plan that was accepted by Israel and rejected by the Palestinians. Since then, Israel has withdrawn from Palestinian territories and elected a coalition government committed to further withdrawals. Meanwhile, the Palestinians have elected a government committed to destroying Israel. It seems that one party needs more pushing than the other, but if the Palestinians do not want a deal there will not be one. America needs European and Arab states to join it, seriously for once, in this effort.  Alex Pustilnik New York SIR – You highlighted the plight of the inhabitants of illegal settlements in Almaty (“The revolt in Almaty”, August 5th). The city's mayor faces a dilemma: on the one hand, property rights and the rule of law are a cornerstone of any free society, including Kazakhstan. On the other, the city authorities have a moral duty to provide, whether through public or private means, sufficient and adequate housing for the genuinely distressed inhabitants of the settlements. But this cannot be achieved overnight and the authorities are developing and publicly discussing plans to this end. The problem is not easy to resolve and it was therefore unhelpful that your article played the “ethnic card” with respect to the city's current and previous mayors. Ethnicity has nothing to do with this issue, rather it is about the growing pains of a fast-developing economy in a society that is in transition.  Erlan Idrissov Ambassador for Kazakhstan London SIR – You pointed out the desensitising nature of Hong Kong living (“Hard rain”, August 5th). One way to make Hong Kong more bearable is counterintuitive: build higher. Relaxing the maximum height restrictions would allow more green areas at street level. Alas, the city's laissez-faire tradition will be used as an excuse to do nothing.  Martin Lodge Hong Kong SIR – Thanks for an entertaining article on the objects that can come flying down on pedestrians from buildings in Hong Kong. My favourite “from the skies” memory is of a letter that appeared in a Hong Kong newspaper: “I was walking through Wan Chai when some clot shat on me.” Wes Pedersen  Chevy Chase, Maryland SIR – Women may have benefited from the rise of technology and globalisation and the importance of emotional intelligence, empathy and communication in modern professional careers (“How women won the sex war”, August 5th). But surely The Economist would wish to give some credit to Western liberal democracy for the levelling of gender in public life. On this point, the most notable exponent at Harvard is not Larry Summers but Harvey Mansfield, long of the government department, who argues in his book, “Manliness”, that: “the entire enterprise of modernity...could be understood as a project to keep manliness unemployed. The goal of modern liberalism was the rational state, a state that completed the long-standing attempt at the rational control of nature and human life that began with Machiavelli and culminated with Hegel.” Who needs Gary Cooper when you've got the Department of Homeland Security? Paul Nielsen Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire SIR – It might interest you to know that not a single serious study has ever been able to demonstrate a link between “emotional intelligence” and leadership effectiveness. The most robust and consistent single predictor of leadership effectiveness is, simply, intelligence. Emotional intelligence sells well, but scientific evidence supporting it is almost as solid as that supporting the effectiveness of homeopathy. Erkko Autio Professor, department of management HEC Lausanne Lausanne, Switzerland SIR – A recent survey by an academic at Georgia Institute of Technology asked female scientists in tenure track positions what the most significant issue was that they faced. The overwhelming answer was juggling family and career. Developing research questions, managing students, supervising researchers, balancing budgets, filing reports and making deadlines were all of trivial concern compared with planning child care. Are these female PhDs too incompetent to find a solution? Or are they the ones primarily responsible for ensuring that their children are properly looked after? Ann Gallagher Bethesda, Maryland SIR – Only a man could fail to mention the real advantages that men have over women: an ambition for success, even at the cost of their own health; and a parasitic ability to utilise the domestic and child-care labour of their women without feeling guilt. Forget about empathy and emotional intelligence—they just get women sidelined into personnel departments. The only way to attain real power is really, really to want it and not to care about the cost. Hilary Potts London SIR – Or is it madam? As a male engineer, I read your thoughts on gender differences with new-found resolve. At work today, I had ample time to contemplate my impending obsolescence after switching on my computer so that it could set about the passé task of designing aircraft. In the past it was slide rules and T-squares that did this work, but the tremendous amount of muscle power needed to wield these instruments saved me from redundancy. Clearly, what I need to do to get ahead is to work on such social skills as going behind people's backs, staying angry for long periods of time and spreading bitchy rumours—teamwork and technical skills be damned.

https://www.economist.com/unknown/2005/07/28/history-in-brief,"The birth of the state of Israel was the fulfilment of the Zionist movement, conceived in the 19th century to create a homeland for Jews. Ancient Jews had scattered around the world following their conquest and occupation by the Romans and the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. In the 1880s Jews seeking escape from persecution in Europe began migrating en masse to Palestine, then an Arabic-speaking part of the Ottoman empire; by 1914 Palestine's Jewish population had more than doubled. In 1917, as British forces were despatching the Ottomans in the first world war, Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, stating support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine without “prejudice” to the rights of the Palestinian Arabs. After the war, Palestine was placed under a British mandate and, as Zionist immigration increased, violence flared between its Jewish and Arab communities. After the Holocaust, pressure grew for the international recognition of a Jewish state, and the UN proposed the partition of the Palestine mandate into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The Arab states rejected partition and invaded Palestine as soon as the British withdrew. On May 14th 1948, the state of Israel was declared, with David Ben-Gurion as its first prime minister. The Arab invasion was unsuccessful and more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs were expelled during the fighting. In 1949 Israel signed armistice agreements with its neighbours. However the Arab governments and the Palestinian refugees refused to recognise Israel's existence as a legitimate country. The region remained unstable. To prop up the beleaguered republic, the Jewish diaspora poured money into Israel, and in the late 1960s the United States became its principal financial and political supporter. Within a few years, the young country had developed an efficient agrarian and technological society, and further strengthened its military superiority over the surrounding Arab countries. Israel demonstrated its new might in 1956 when it invaded the Egyptian Sinai (with British and French collusion), after Egypt's nationalisation of the Suez Canal. American intervention forced Israel's withdrawal. War returned in 1967, when Egypt, Syria and Jordan massed forces to challenge Israel. In a pre-emptive strike, Israel smashed its enemies' forces in just six days and captured the West Bank, the Gaza strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai peninsula. As the Israeli government moved to build Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), led by Yasser Arafat, took the lead role in fighting the Israeli occupation. In October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack in the Sinai and the Golan Heights. The Israelis were not defeated but Arab honour was restored, paving the way for peace negotiations under American auspices. In 1979 Egypt signed a peace agreement with Israel, and in 1994 Jordan did the same. But only in the early 1990s, after years of intifada (popular uprising), did Israel and the Palestinians begin to speak of a peace process. Despite the establishment of a Palestinian Authority and the hand-over of parts of the West Bank and the Gaza strip to its control, Palestinian terrorism, Israel's harsh occupation policies, the accelerated construction of Jewish settlements, the plight of the refugees and the disputed status of Jerusalem all continued to block progress. A second, bloodier intifada began in 2000, and peace remains elusive. (For recent developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, see our backgrounder.)"
https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/03/12/apeirogon-depicts-a-moving-israeli-palestinian-friendship,"Apeirogon. By Colum McCann. Random House; 480 pages; $28. Bloomsbury; £18.99. COLUM MCCANN’S new novel refers at one point to the “Jerusalem Syndrome”: the messianic delusions that “proximity to the holy places” can induce in pilgrims to the city. Foreign writers and artists often display their own version of this mania. It consists in ordering the divided peoples of the Holy Land to recognise how much they have in common (in history, heritage, culture, even genetics) and instructing them to live in peace. Irish-born but long resident in New York, Mr McCann knows every pitfall that awaits the moralising traveller keen to swell the region’s “corny” and “trite” rhetoric “of justice, of kinship, of reconciliation”. From its mysterious title onwards, the oblique storytelling of “Apeirogon”, his seventh novel, shuns the conventions of the high-minded outsider’s reportage. Yet, for all his sophisticated artistry, the authority of this work of fiction rests ultimately on its truth. Mr McCann did not invent the entwined destinies of Bassam Aramin and Rami Elhanan. Rather, their real, conjoined lives inspired this “hybrid novel”, which weaves documentary and imagination into its toughly lyrical fabric. Both bereaved fathers, the pair of friends decided that “the only revenge is making peace”. Brought up in Hebron, Mr Aramin was a Fatah militant who served seven years in jail but soon set out “to pit himself against the ignorance of violence, including his own”. In 2007 an Israeli soldier killed his ten-year-old daughter Abir with a rubber bullet as she bought sweets in the West Bank town of Anata. Mr Elhanan is an Israeli whose father, a Holocaust survivor, immigrated from Hungary, but whose mother’s family had lived in Jerusalem for six generations. Hamas terrorists killed his 13-year-old daughter Smadar in 1997 in a suicide-bomb attack on the city’s Ben Yehuda Street. But he progressed from viewing Palestinians as threats from “the dark side of the moon” to acknowledging “the equality of pain”. First in Combatants for Peace (Mr Elhanan fought in three of Israel’s wars), then in the Parents Circle that brings together bereaved families from both sides, the duo have sought through their activism to replace the clear lines of enmity with “the tangle of knowing each other”. Journalists and film-makers have told their story before. Mr McCann, too, co-operated closely with the friends. “Apeirogon”, though, wraps the facts of their journeys, and their griefs, into an elliptical and fragmentary narrative. It situates their quest for hope within the art and landscape of Israel-Palestine and the “smashed jigsaw” of rival histories. “Geography here is everything,” Mr McCann writes. His mosaic of 1,001 colourful, enigmatic paragraphs range across the scenery of a military occupation that stifles the West Bank like “the rim of a tightening lung” and, for Palestinians, “deprives you of tomorrow”. The reader glimpses the men’s zigzag route through loss into peacemaking via vivid, jagged tesserae of prose. Meanwhile, images of flight, flux and movement—involving migratory birds, watercourses, artworks, even weaponised drones—offer a hawk’s, or dove’s, eye view of the seething cauldron that the novelised Mr Elhanan calls a “condensed everywhere”. An “apeirogon”, the geometric term that becomes Mr McCann’s key metaphor, is a shape “with a countably infinite number of sides”. The patchwork pattern of this novel matches the polyhedral complexity of the pasts it evokes. With “one story becoming another”, “Apeirogon” insists on “the sheer simultaneity of all things”. The results are frequently beautiful, sometimes baffling. The imagery often dazzles, but plainer passages that inhabit the men’s minds as they wrestle against rage and bitterness towards an “ethic of reciprocity” have the greatest emotional power. At the core of this fractal fiction is a simple, radiant myth: “The hero makes a friend of his enemy.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/pomegranate/2014/03/25/hope-through-architecture,"Jewish and Arab architects might one day share their heritage and skills NOT only in 2013 did the building of Jewish settlements on the West Bank, the core of a would-be Palestinian state, grow at twice the rate of 2012; its uniform architecture is increasingly attracting Palestinians. In place of their distinctive rough-hewn stone houses, Palestinian builders now tend to prefer the uniform style of red-roofed houses that mark out Israeli settlements. “People always look up to the colonial power, even if they resent it,” says Renad Shqeirat, a Palestinian architect and conservationist. “They see their architecture as a sign of modernisation.” It is increasingly hard to tell settler and new Palestinian housing estates apart by their style. Fuelled by high Jewish and Palestinian population growth and a facts-on-the-ground struggle to control as much territory as possible, the Jewish settlement of Har Homa on Jerusalem’s southern edge merges with the new estates of the once pastoral Palestinian village of Beit Sahour. One of Palestine’s biggest property developers, Bashar al-Masri, takes pride in building Palestine’s first “settlement”. He has dispensed with the traditional shape of a Palestinian village, which often cascades randomly down a West Bank hill, and has instead spent $1-billion-odd to plonk his new city on a hilltop, resembling the nearby Jewish settlements that dominate the surrounding Palestinian villages yet are disconnected from them. A new Israeli commuter city, Modi’in, served as a model. Mr Masri has called on Israelis seeking new flats to buy in his city in the cause of coexistence. Even the name he chose, Rawabi, is an Arabic translation of Maale, Hebrew for hilltop, which many Jewish settlements have as part of their name. Urbanisation is changing Palestinian landscape in other ways too. Where winding roads once mapped the West Bank’s meandering contours, Israeli highways between the settlements drive straight lines through the hills. Once a hallmark, terraces laden with vines and olive trees have long since been abandoned to weeds, as Palestinian smallholders leave their farms for Israeli construction sites. “Work in Israel has taken a whole generation away from the fields,” says John Ashley, a British agronomist based in Ramallah, the Palestinians’ administrative capital, north of Jerusalem. Attempting to reverse the tide, a Palestinian conservation association, Riwaq, is trying to reinstill Palestinians’ pride in their rural heritage. Launched in 1992, Riwaq recently unveiled a project to restore 50 of the 420 villages in the West Bank and Gaza. In an Ottoman house in Salfit, a town of 12,000 in the shadow of Ariel, one of the West Bank’s biggest Jewish settlements, Ms Shqeirat, one of Riwaq’s promoters, has torn down ugly concrete additions and used local material to restore arches, crannies and balconies. She has entrusted the building to a local women’s co-operative because “women look after buildings better than men”. It is a first step, she hopes, towards restoring Salfit’s charming but decrepit Ottoman quarter. With Swedish and Kuwaiti support, Riwaq has restored other old West Bank towns in their entirety, and turned forlorn old caravanserai into boutique hotels. “We’re slowly winning the war,” says Ms Shqeirat, optimistically. “We used to have to beg people to let us into their homes; now they are rushing to us and offering to pay.”"
https://www.economist.com/pomegranate/2014/03/20/a-gurgle-of-hope,"Will the Israelis allow the Palestinians to exploit their own oil? CONFIDENT of striking oil in the rocky hills of the West Bank, Palestine’s government is to tender a concession for exploration around Rantiss, a village north of Jerusalem near the armistice line that separated Palestinian territory from Israel in 1967. “We would net $1 billion over a decade,” says President Mahmoud Abbas’s economic adviser, Muhammad Mustafa, who expects to launch a tender imminently. He points to commercial production by an Israeli company, Givot Olam, which is drilling just inside Israel, tapping the same reservoir. But a series of obstacles dogs exploration, as Mr Mustafa, who is also Palestine’s deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, admits. Israel’s military administration, which oversees the West Bank, has not yet given approval for exploration, and the field, says Dror Etkes, an expert on Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank, lies inside an Israeli-declared military zone. Under Israeli-Palestinian agreements dating back two decades, Israel exercises full control over the predominantly rural swathe of the West Bank known as Area C, which accounts for 62% of the occupied territory (excluding the Gaza Strip). Israeli hardliners are pressing to annex Area C, which includes Rantiss. Some Israeli officials also fear that an influx of capital into Palestine would empower it in its struggle against Israel’s occupation. Israel has impeded the development of a gasfield in a bigger concession off Gaza’s coast that the Palestinian authorities awarded to British Gas over a decade ago. A World Bank report estimated in October last year that Palestine’s economy would soar by a third if it were able to exploit Area C and other riches offshore. Mr Mustafa’s decision to explore Area C without Israeli approval may bolster a Palestinian campaign to recover the territory’s raw materials and to develop its agriculture, both of which Israel has exploited for the past 45 years. A host of Western powers, including the so-called Quartet that groups together the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, have given the Palestinians their support. The Quartet’s representative, Tony Blair, a former British prime minister, has prepared an eight-point plan to spend $12 billion to regenerate the Palestinian economy, with an emphasis on tourism, farming and the mineral exploitation of Area C. But without the Israeli military administration granting easier access and permits, the Palestinians’ oil is unlikely to flow soon."
https://www.economist.com/letters/2012/07/14/on-london-palestine-hypoxia-currency-super-sizing-repetition,"Capital gains  SIR – You were unduly dismissive of the Green Belt in your special report on London (“On a high”, June 30th). Vivid Economics, a consultancy, has recently shown that the true value of the Green Belt is not properly understood. It is a working landscape combining a range of environmental services, such as woodland cover, public footpaths and agricultural production (particularly salad crops), while mostly retaining its rural beauty. There is enough brownfield land in London (with more in surrounding regions) to provide 400,000 new homes. Without the Green Belt London would have gone the way of many other cities and become a car-choked, sprawling morass with large areas of redundant suburbs. That’s why other great world cities, such as Seoul and Toronto, now also have Green Belts of their own. Paul MinerSenior planning officer Campaign to Protect Rural EnglandLondon  SIR – Your article on London’s infrastructure echoed the claim of BAA, which owns Heathrow, that a city can have only a single airport “hub”. The implication is that without a third runway, London faces inexorable decline. But Moscow, Tokyo and New York all have two hub airports. Hubs need critical mass and good connectivity. BAA, as the owner of Gatwick and Stansted as well, made sure that it did not create any rivals. Indeed, by encouraging budget airlines to dominate these airports, and only half-heartedly promoting improvements to rail links and runway capacity, it made it difficult for a new hub to emerge. One surely will now the monopoly is being broken. Gatwick is constrained to a single runway for another decade, but with a link into Crossrail, Stansted could rival Heathrow. There is room for four runways, with a tiny fraction of the impact at Heathrow. And, unlike the proposed airport in the Thames Estuary, people live nearby so they could work there. Michael SchabasLondon  SIR – London “subsidises the rest of the country to the tune of £15 billion each year”, you said. Have you considered that London’s “subsidy” might be the result of centuries of siphoning off the wealth created by the rest of Britain? I don’t seem to recall reading much about London’s contribution to the industrial revolution, and I’m pretty certain our offshore oil industry isn’t in the Thames Estuary. What London has contributed recently is the transformation of wealth earned elsewhere into a London property boom, leading in turn to the present real-world crisis created by the unreal world of London’s financial centre. Francis ToolisDumfries, Scotland  * SIR – The concentration of company headquarters in London arises mostly from the desire of the few top people to be “in town”. With modern communications there is no real need for them to be there. In fact, very many large foreign companies avoid the area and its associated high costs. When I worked in Germany, London was referred to as the Romania of the then Common Market. Having worked in Romania, I could agree. By a fluke of timing your special report appeared in the same week that Vince Cable called the City a ""cesspit"". He was a little off mark: a cesspit can be cleaned out. A better analogy would be an inoperable cancer. Eric Evans Dorchester, Dorset SIR – Your special report was a thinly veiled manifesto for a unilateral declaration of independence for London. As a new independent global city state, joining Singapore and Dubai, and soon to be joined by Shanghai and others, London would be controlling its own destiny at the centre of a future club of truly global nations. Kieran SheedyLondon  SIR – On many occasions I have had people mention to me, in passing, their dislike of immigrants: from foreign consultants in hospitals to foreign cleaners. The sad irony is that I am an immigrant, but in their eyes I don’t count—I am white and speak English (albeit with a North American twang). These people aren’t anti-immigration. They are racist, plain and simple, and the media need to label it appropriately. Only then can politicians be free to deal with immigration sensibly. Carolyn GibsonBirmingham SIR – You criticised Londoners for their curmudgeonly attitude to the rich, bankers and immigrants—“those on whom London depends”—with no analysis as to why some might feel discomfort. Few of us live in the gilded cage of the outer-national and, in spite of our inclinations to welcome the world’s brightest and best to our respective countries, is it unreasonable to expect one’s guests not to leave with the silver? Matthew IngramLondon Palestine and the UAE * SIR – In your article on Palestine (“The calm may not last for ever”, June 30th) you said that cash donations to the Palestinian Authority from the United Arab Emirates have dwindled because their government “seems to have sided with [Muhammad] Dahlan”, a supposed rival to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. The UAE has thankfully always been supportive. We in the prime minister’s office remain confident that it will continue to support the Palestinian Authority, both financially and politically, without regard to internal Palestinian politics. Ghassan KhatibOffice of the Prime MinisterThe Palestinian Authority Nutrient pollution  SIR – Your article on the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia noted the potential of the “world’s largest water-quality trading programme” (“Blooming horrible”, June 23rd). However because of the way trading programmes are implemented in America it will do little for the Gulf. Federal law imposes nutrient limits only on point sources, like municipal waste-water-treatment plants. When point-source limits are enforced, credit trading allows those sources to comply by buying nutrient reductions. Farmers are hoped to be the preferred seller. Yet point sources contribute only about 10% of the total nitrogen load to the Gulf. Most agricultural operations face no federal requirements but contribute most of the pollution. Cracking down on the point sources with mandatory caps will make, at best, a small dent in the problem. Promoting the idea that farmers will be customers for point sources is an unfortunate diversion from the real challenge of radically reducing run-off. Kurt StephensonDepartment of Agricultural and Applied EconomicsVirginia Tech Leonard ShabmanResident scholar Resources for the FutureWashington, DC Big notes, small change SIR – There was truth in your article on currency (“My money is bigger than yours”, June 23rd). I recall numerous “beach boys” begging on the popular beaches of India in the 1970s. They would rush first to foreigners, mostly Americans, for dimes and quarters (no hint of numerical value there) or an occasional dollar bill. But the most sought-after were the generous Italians for their highly denominated lire. The poor beggar-boys would hand over their day’s collection to a black-market dealer who would give them a few local coins and a quick lesson in foreign rates of exchange. Rajan MahadevanSassofortino, Italy Go large  SIR – Surely there’s enough obesity-related disease around to justify Michael Bloomberg’s ban on buckets of soda (Lexington, June 9th), even if it is a “top-down” approach? Recently, while driving, I stopped for a “small” coke. I was handed a huge cup and told that every soda was one dollar. Not only did I fill it up, but I then drank five times the amount I wanted while reproaching myself for not having the resolve to reject such a “bargain”. Our guts and brains have been hijacked and we should welcome any attempt to chip away at the deleterious super-sizing mania. Paula MaterreWondervu, Colorado Bit between the teeth  SIR – Your use of the words “bit” and “bits” is a bit much. In a recent issue you went a bit too far with three “bits” in the same article (“Shaming the unshameable”, June 16th). A useful bit of the computer—edit, find—can help you avoid these bits of excess. That’s my two bits worth. Lynne FarrMountain View, Hawaii * Letter appears online only"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2013/07/06/talks-about-talks,"“TRUST us,” say the Americans seeking an Israeli-Palestinian agreement leading to two states. But few people do. John Kerry, the American secretary of state, has little to show for shuttling around the region in five trips in the past three months. Deadlines for relaunching talks have come and gone. Israelis, in particular, feel they have little reason to move. Things are pretty calm at home. Political violence by Palestinians is rare. By contrast, the Arab world is in turmoil. Mr Kerry’s visits hardly get mentioned in the Israeli news. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is more sensitive to noises on his boisterous right flank than to those on the doveish left. He remembers that Jewish settlers on the West Bank, abetted by religious nationalists, brought an end in 1999 to his first stint as prime minister, after he had sought to mollify America by withdrawing settlers from bits of the Palestinian territories. Now the settlers there are even stronger. Their firebrands are winning plum jobs in Mr Netanyahu’s party. In response to Mr Kerry’s suggestions for getting talks started again, the Israelis have spent weeks arguing over how many dozen Palestinian prisoners to release among several thousand and in what stages. “These details are obscuring the bigger picture,” says a frustrated Palestinian negotiator. When the Palestinians return to the UN in New York in September with a fresh bid to upgrade their status there, the Americans may hesitate before using their veto again; last time, embarrassingly, only eight countries joined them. And if talks continue to go nowhere the Europeans may be considering whether to stop paying for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which runs the West Bank under Israel’s eye, perhaps even causing it to collapse. A senior Palestinian official says he expects a third intifada (uprising) to break out in due course, possibly targeting the Palestinian leadership. Some Arab officials still hope that Mr Netanyahu may yet keep the ball in play by promising in principle to withdraw from most of the West Bank occupied by Israel after the war of 1967. That might conceivably be enough to let Mahmoud Abbas, the PA’s president, return to the table. Mr Netanyahu has aired the prospect of a smaller “interim” Palestinian state. But Mr Abbas fears that, if he accepted that idea, it would allow Israel’s settlers to gobble up the rest for good. If Mr Kerry gave up, would hopes for a two-state solution die? One regional idea has outlived all the others: the Arab Peace Initiative unveiled in Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, in 2002. Since endorsed by 57 Muslim governments, including Iran’s, it offers to recognise Israel once it withdraws from the territory it captured in 1967 and deals with the plight of Palestinian refugees. Israeli politicians across the political spectrum recently debated the Arab initiative in a side hall of their parliament. Nine Arab foreign ministers have publicly stated, in Mr Kerry’s presence, that they would go still further and accept modifications to Israel’s borders with land swaps, implicitly letting the bulk of the Jewish settlements, which are close to the old 1967 border, stay within an expanded Israel. Questioning the Arab world’s long-standing policy of barring contact with Israel, an Arab dignitary recently suggested asking Mr Netanyahu to attend a secret Arab League meeting in Amman, capital of neighbouring Jordan. Another proposed a “roadshow” of Arabs and Israelis touring the region together. Others discuss how they might gradually normalise ties with Israel, as Israel normalises its own with the Palestinians. If the Israeli authorities would let Palestinian pilgrims have unfettered access to shrines in Jerusalem, Arab states could—it has been suggested—give Israelis equally unfettered access to Jewish shrines in the Arab world, such as that of the Prophet Ezekiel in Iraq, whence many Israelis stem. “The Arab world has crossed the Rubicon, and moved from a platform of war to peace,” says a former senior Saudi official, who contemplates contacts with Israel. “But we’re waiting for Israel to respond.”"
https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/02/narendra-modi-has-shifted-india-from-the-palestinians-to-israel,"FOREIGN NEWS usually gets short shrift in India. Yet for the past month the country’s television channels have been dominated by wall-to-wall coverage of events in Israel and Gaza, mostly from Israel’s perspective. News anchors in bulletproof vests stand in the desert delivering breathless reports on the aftermath of Hamas’s atrocities in Israel on October 7th. Talk-show hosts restage the Palestinian terrorist group’s attack from Gaza with toy soldiers and miniature bulldozers. Weeks into the war, coverage remains intense. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas The media’s fascination with Israel’s plight and retribution coincides with a marked shift in the Indian government’s stance on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. It has moved from backing the Palestinians to more or less unqualified support for Israel. The pivot is based on a realist reappraisal of Indian interests in the Middle East. It has also met with strong public backing from Narendra Modi’s domestic supporters, which is gratifying for Mr Modi’s government ahead of state elections this month and a general election next year. In the past, like many countries in the global south, India tempered any expression of support for Israel with expressions of concern for the Palestinians’ plight. No more. Mr Modi took to X (formerly Twitter) within hours of Hamas’s assault to express his horror at the “terrorist attacks” and declare that “we stand in solidarity with Israel”. It took five days for India’s Ministry of External Affairs to reiterate, in response to questions from reporters, that India continued to support a two-state solution to the conflict. On October 27th, in a departure from its usual voting record, India abstained as the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza; it objected that the text did not condemn Hamas’s assault. The shift reflects India’s growing defence and commercial ties to Israel. Co-operation between the two countries has been deepening ever since Israel provided India with military help during the Kargil war against Pakistan in 1999. That was long before America took a serious interest in military co-operation with India. Over the past decade India has bought missiles, drones and border-security equipment (and probably surveillance software, though it has not admitted this) from Israel, making it the Israeli defence industry’s biggest foreign customer. A bromance between Mr Modi and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has deepened the relationship. So has the two countries’ shared preoccupation with fighting terrorism, especially the Islamist variant. Explaining the abstention in the UN vote, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, said in a speech on October 29th that India took a strong position on terrorism “because we are big victims of terrorism”. India has also been increasing its ties with Gulf Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And it can ill afford to alienate them; it depends on them for much of its oil and goodwill towards an estimated 9m expatriate Indian workers. Yet the fact that both countries have recently moved closer to Israel has allowed Mr Modi to effect his shift with alacrity. Even in the current crisis, the Saudis and Emiratis appear reluctant to allow the events in Gaza to cause a rupture in their long-term rapprochement with Israel. Domestically, the Modi government’s pivot is essentially all upside. The Congress-led opposition has condemned it; leaders of India’s 200m Muslims have heavily criticised Israel’s military response. Yet the Indian middle-class that mostly backs Mr Modi is especially concerned about Islamist terrorism. Its members look on Hamas’s attack and recall the tragedy Mumbai suffered in 2008, when Pakistani Islamists killed 175 people and wounded more than 300 during a four-day rampage. It included an attack on a Jewish community centre in the city, where the terrorists murdered the rabbi and his pregnant wife. There is a small risk the government will overplay its hand. As the civilian death toll in Gaza rises, India’s Arab partners might turn against the Israelis and their backers more aggressively. Mr Modi has latterly hedged against that possibility. He has reached out to Palestinian leaders, offering Indian condolences and humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, his Hindu-nationalist henchmen are unrestrained in using the conflict to stoke the Islamophobia that has propelled their party’s rise. Even if Mr Modi’s pivot becomes difficult abroad, it will probably help him win elections.■ Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia: South Korean politics is one big row about history (Oct 26th)India-Pakistan relations are becoming more marginal and worse (Oct 19th)Pakistan expels undocumented Afghans.

Britain's official mandate over Palestine, from the League of Nations, comes into effect.  1936: A three-year Arab revolt begins, amid frustration at rising Jewish immigration and continued colonial rule. 1939: Britain imposes restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine. 1945: At the end of the second world war, America urges Britain to lift its restrictions on Jewish refugees settling in Palestine but Britain resists this pressure. 1946: The King David Hotel, Britain's military headquarters in Jerusalem, is bombed by a Jewish militant group, Irgun. 1947: Britain asks the recently formed United Nations to take over the Palestine problem. The UN proposes partition. The Arabs reject this. 1948: The state of Israel is proclaimed. Neighbouring Arab states invade it. Israel's nascent defence forces repel them. Around 700,000 Arabs flee. Though Egypt ends up occupying the Gaza strip and Transjordan takes East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Israel ends up bigger than the UN partition plan had proposed.  1956: Egypt nationalises the Suez Canal and closes off access to the Israeli port of Eilat. Israel, France and Britain form a secret pact to attack Egypt. Under American pressure, they are forced to withdraw. 1964: Arab leaders create the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), whose founding charter calls for a Palestinian Arab state encompassing the whole of British Mandate Palestine and declares the establishment of Israel “illegal and null and void”. 1967: After Egypt masses its troops in the Sinai desert and blockades Eilat, the six-day war is launched and won by Israel. Sinai and the Gaza strip are taken from Egypt; the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan; and the Golan Heights from Syria. The PLO moves to Jordan. The UN passes Resolution 242, calling among other things for Israeli forces to withdraw from “territories occupied in the recent conflict” (a phrase whose precise meaning still provokes fierce debate) in return for Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist peacefully. The Arab League issues its “three noes”: no peace with Israel, no negotiations with Israel, no recognition of Israel. 1969: America launches the Rogers plan, which reiterates Resolution 242's land-for-peace formula. Both sides reject it. 1970: In what becomes known as “Black September”, Jordan expels the PLO after it creates a “state within a state” and hijacks American, Swiss, Israeli and British planes, holding some passengers hostage. The PLO eventually re-establishes itself in Lebanon, from where it launches raids on Israel.  1973: The Yom Kippur war: attacks by Egypt and Syria on Judaism's holiest day take Israel by surprise but it strikes back and its troops cross the Suez Canal and enter Syria before the UN calls for a ceasefire.  1977: Egypt's President Anwar Sadat becomes the first Arab leader to go to Israel, visiting Jerusalem to seek a peace settlement. 1978: After terrorist attacks on buses in northern Israel, its forces launch an incursion into Lebanon to attack PLO bases.

The PLO moves to Tunisia. America sends peacekeeping troops to Lebanon. It also launches the Reagan plan, proposing self-government for the West Bank and Gaza, though in association with Jordan rather than as an independent state. Israel, followed later by the PLO and Jordan, reject it.

The clashes continue into the early 1990s. 1988: America launches the Shultz plan, incorporating elements of earlier peace proposals. The PLO issues a statement renouncing terrorism and recognising Israel's right to exist, leading America to open direct talks with the PLO. Jordan renounces its claim to sovereignty over the West Bank in favour of the PLO.  1991: After the first Gulf war ends, America launches the Madrid peace conference, with Israel holding its first formal negotiations with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestinian representatives (though not the PLO).  1993: Secret talks begin in Oslo between Israeli academics and PLO officials, leading to the Oslo accords. These propose an interim Palestinian Authority (PA), conducting limited self-government in part of the occupied territories, and a phased plan leading to a permanent peace settlement. 1994: The PLO's chairman, Yasser Arafat, returns from exile to the occupied territories. Israel and Jordan sign a peace treaty. 1995: Israel and the PLO sign the Oslo II agreement, under which Israel hands over security responsibility to the Palestinian Authority in parts of the occupied territories.  1998: Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, sign the Wye River memorandum, which aims to clarify the Oslo II agreement and set a timetable for its implementation. 1999: After slippage in the implementation of the Oslo accords, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Arafat sign the Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum, setting a new timetable, in talks hosted by Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. 2000: Talks at Camp David between Mr Barak and Arafat end in failure. Israel's opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, makes a provocative visit to Temple Mount in Jerusalem—known to Muslims as the “noble sanctuary”, one of their holiest places. Incensed, Palestinian militants launch a second intifada. President Bill Clinton hastily calls another summit at Sharm el-Sheikh, which reaches an agreement “to return the situation to that which existed prior to the current crisis”. A fact-finding commission headed by George Mitchell, an American former senator, is set up. Amid attacks from Lebanese militants, Israel pulls out of its “security zone” in southern Lebanon, as Mr Barak had promised the previous year. 2001: Between George Bush taking office as American president and Ariel Sharon winning the Israeli election, Israeli and Palestinian delegations hold talks at Taba in Egypt. But Mr Sharon refuses to talk peace while terrorist attacks continue, and the Oslo process stops. The Mitchell commission produces its report but it fails to make much impact. Mr Bush then sends the CIA chief, George Tenet, to the region. He produces another report proposing a ceasefire.  2002: After several Palestinian suicide bombings, Mr Sharon launches Operation Defensive Shield, seizing areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, which Israel accuses of failing to stop militants' attacks. Most of the West Bank and Gaza comes under siege as Israeli forces close down the areas. The Quartet group (America, the European Union, Russia and the UN) launches the “road map”, a new phased plan for peace, including the creation of an independent Palestine. Mr Bush calls for new Palestinian leadership in place of Arafat.  2003: Under pressure from the Quartet, Arafat hands much of his power to Mahmoud Abbas, a moderate, who becomes Palestinian prime minister. Mr Bush gets Mr Abbas and Mr Sharon to shake hands on the road map. The Palestinian militant groups agree among themselves a fragile ceasefire. But it collapses after only seven weeks: after a Hamas suicide bomber kills 22 people on a Jerusalem bus, Israel resumes its “targeted killings” of militant groups' political leaders. Mr Abbas resigns and his place is taken by Ahmed Qurei, another moderate, though closer to Mr Arafat.  2004: Mr Sharon unveils a controversial proposal to evacuate all Jewish settlements in the Gaza strip. After a suicide bombing kills ten in the Israeli port of Ashdod, Israel steps up its attacks on Palestinian militants and kills Hamas's spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. Arafat dies in a Paris hospital and Mr Abbas is named his successor as PLO leader.  2005: Palestinians elect Mr Abbas to succeed Arafat as PA president. At a summit with Mr Sharon in Sharm el-Sheikh, both men declare a ceasefire."
https://www.economist.com/pomegranate/2014/09/01/will-they-wont-they-join-the-dance,"HAMAS, the Islamist movement that Israel has been clobbering in Gaza, now says it would back the Palestinian Authority (PA) under Mahmoud Abbas if he were to bid to join the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague. The court could then investigate whether war crimes had been committed during the recent war in Gaza—by Israeli forces or by Palestinian ones. The PA has long threatened to join the court, but it is still not sure to do so. Joining it carries risks for the Palestinians—and for the court itself. Ever since the ICC was founded in 2002, it has suffered because of its limited powers and jurisdiction. It depends on its member states to carry out arrests. It can open investigations only in countries that have signed its treaty, or that invite it in; Israel has done neither. Alternatively, though the UN Security Council may tell the court to open an investigation anywhere, the United States has said it would veto any such proposal for Gaza. In 2009, when Mr Abbas asked the ICC to investigate allegations of war crimes by Israel during its war in Gaza in 2008-09, the court’s prosecutor refused to do so because Palestine was not then recognised by the UN as a state. That changed in 2012, when the UN General Assembly voted Palestine an “observer state”. Most international lawyers reckon that if the Palestinians applied to join the ICC now, they would get in. The court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, implied as much when she invited them to submit a new request by August 5th, when met the Palestinian foreign minister, Riad al-Malki (pictured leaving the court). But Palestinian accession would not mean that Israeli officials would face trial soon. The court generally take years investigating cases before issuing indictments, and the prosecutor’s hands are currently full. So long as Israel controls access to Gaza, the ICC would find it hard to carry out investigations there. In any case, Israel’s allies, not just America, oppose a Palestinian move to join the court, arguing that joining it would upset peace negotiations. If the court wades into Gaza, some Western governments might refuse to pay for its budget or even to uphold some of its decisions. And not all Palestinians are itching to join: since Hamas has fired thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets, it would be vulnerable to indictments, too. Yet some people at the ICC think Palestinian accession—and the opening of an investigation into Gaza—would help the ICC to fend off accusations that it prosecutes only Africans, who comprise all current indictees; since the court was set up, only two people, both African, have been convicted. “They’ve got to get out of Africa,” says Guénaël Mettraux, a lawyer who has defended suspects before the court."

But to trumpet this mighty yet flawed behemoth in an associated leader as “Asia's new model company” was a leap too far. Last year you averred: “it's time to stop coddling the all-conquering chaebol” (“The chaebol conundrum”, April 3rd 2010) and in an accompanying report offered a balanced and critical appraisal of Korean conglomerates and of Samsung in particular (“Return of the overlord”). Now, alas, you have joined the coddlers. What has changed? Not the chaebol. Ahn Chul-soo, a Korean IT entrepreneur and political sensation, calls them zoos, where employees are caged animals, and accuses them of “squeezing small companies for every penny.” Even President Lee Myung-bak, himself a former chief executive at Hyundai, has chided the chaebol for stifling start-ups. You also seemed to make light of Samsung's Byzantine governance. Yet third-generation hereditary succession is as grotesque at Samsung as in Pyongyang. Lee Jae-yong will inherit a company bigger than North Korea, but by what right? Koreans are asking that question; it was a shameful lapse that you did not. Aidan Foster-CarterHonorary senior research fellow in sociology and modern KoreaLeeds University A view on Palestine  SIR – Charlemagne (September 24th) was right to argue that European leaders should support Palestine's application to the UN. The Palestinian Authority has worked hard to demonstrate that Palestine is worthy of statehood. Huge progress, unimaginable in the Arafat era, has been made. Palestinian forces have ensured that all cities in the West Bank are terrorist-free, and the vast majority of Palestinians have no desire to return to violence, despite the siren voice of Hamas. I witnessed all this at first hand as the senior British army officer responsible for assisting the PA in reforming security between 2007 and 2009. These positive developments are very much in Israel's interests too. General Gavriel Ashkenazi, commander of the Israeli Defence Forces at the time, put it in a military context when he stated that, “as the Palestinians do more, so will we do less” It is unfortunate that Binyamin Netanyahu seems unable to endorse publicly what his own officials readily admitted to me. Brigadier (Retired) John DeverellLondon The ITU matters  SIR – The suggestion that the International Telecommunication Union cannot foster innovation (“In praise of chaos”, October 1st) is at odds with the fact that our technical standards remain the foundation of the seamless interconnections between fixed, wireless, satellite and fibre-optic networks on which the internet depends. The ITU's innovations, developed by our industry members, include xDSL, which is the basis of most fixed broadband connections, HDTV, mobile broadband (3G), optical networks and the H.264 video-coding standard used by YouTube, Blu-ray, smartphones, tablets, etc. Not bad for a “classic example of a sluggish international bureaucracy with antiquated diplomatic rituals.” And although the ITU's members will be reviewing international telecommunication regulations, there is no basis for the claim that any of them intends to pursue an agenda that would see the ITU “take over the running of the internet” (“A plaything of powerful nations”, October 1st). The ITU, as an impartial organisation, neither seeks nor supports such a move. Hamadoun TouréSecretary-general of the ITUGeneva Not FTT * SIR – The analysis you provided of the European Union's proposed financial-transaction tax, or FTT, was acute (“The blizzard from Brussels” October 1st). Not only is this proposal unlikely to achieve its policy aims; more importantly, the commission's own impact assessment suggests that overall, FTT would reduce economic growth and employment in Europe. It is not hard to see why. FTT would raise the cost of capital for firms. It would penalise end users of financial services, from industrial companies to pension funds. And it would place Europe's financial sector at a competitive disadvantage: the commission speculates that up to 90% of the derivatives business could move overseas. AFME represents the leading participants in Europe's financial markets. We understand that Europe's policymakers face a difficult balancing act in promoting recovery, reducing public deficits, stabilising the financial sector and defending the euro. We support their efforts. However, we are in no doubt that imposing a financial transaction tax in Europe would be deeply counterproductive, making economic recovery and financial stability harder to achieve. Simon LewisChief executiveAssociation for Financial Markets in EuropeLondon* SIR – The science of fluid dynamics teaches us that viscosity has a stabilising effect on flows that would otherwise be turbulent. With daily gyrations of the financial markets adding and subtracting untold billions of nominal worth and inducing corresponding shocks on the real economy, a little viscosity in the form of a small transaction tax seems a reasonable price to pay for a bit more stability in the system. Marc HerantLincoln, Massachusetts On liberty  SIR – Your assertion that utilitarians cannot respect the moral rights of individuals is not wholly accurate (“Goodness has nothing to do with it”, September 24th). It is perhaps true that Jeremy Bentham's principle of “the greatest happiness of the greatest number” as the foundation of morality is too callous. But John Stuart Mill refined the doctrine a generation later, advancing the idea of an individual's right to personal liberty as absolute and not to be interfered with by others. Therefore, a utilitarian could not in his good conscience “push the fat guy off” the railway bridge, as you put it, to save the lives of other men. This also negates your assumption that utilitarianism automatically gives politicians a free hand to trample on the rights of particular members of society, suspected terrorists say. In any case, it is only fair that you avoid lumping Mill together with those who seek to make inappropriate use of society's chubbier citizens in order to cut the financial cost of rail-safety improvements. Joe KearinsNorthampton The coming Russian winter  SIR – Your article discussing the shape of a Putin presidency said that the Kremlin often defends its actions “by pointing to the ‘mindlessness' of Russians and the lack of a strong civil society” (“Guess who!”, October 1st). Unfortunately, this is largely correct. The great majority of Russians display no interest in politics, for they regard all politicians, at home as well as abroad, as crooks. How politicians get themselves elected and how they rule is of little or no interest to Russians, as long as they protect them from domestic and foreign enemies. This mentality enables their rulers to act with impunity under the guise of “managed democracy” and bodes ill for Russia's future. Richard PipesCambridge, Massachusetts Don't look to Turkey * SIR – As you say, with her marred human-rights record Turkey cannot be a credible role model for countries experiencing the Arab spring (“A flawed example”, September 24th). Turkey has the highest number of journalists (57), members of parliament (6) mayors (dozens) and political prisoners (thousands) in jail. It is the only member of NATO that forbids a language (Kurdish) that is spoken by 15-20m people to be taught in schools. Somebody should remind Recep Tayyip Erdogan that people who live in s glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Nuri AkgulNew York Losing Jobs  SIR – Thank you for acknowledging the aspect of Steve Jobs's life that made him an icon in my eyes (“The magician”, October 8th). Long before Apple stores and iPods there was a man “who liked to see himself as a hippy, permanently in revolt against big companies”. That such a man, in faded blue jeans and a T-shirt (much less a man who dropped out of college only to drop acid), could become a corporate success meant that my youthful optimism was not simply naive. You sold this man short, however, by describing his life as an inspiration only to businesspeople. I have yet to meet a person of any vocation who is not genuinely moved by his 2005 commencement speech. Delia StoryTempe, Arizona  SIR – Surely a little bit of perspective is needed on Steve Jobs. The world is a big place. He managed successfully to sell some overpriced toys to a comparatively small number of wealthy people in industrialised nations who could afford to play with them. What is the big accomplishment in that? Hermann KaiserBerlin Power and language * SIR – Whoever came up with the headline “Reducing the barnacle bill” (September 3rd) should be given a raise. But there is such a thing as being too clever. In the article, you wrote: “France lost. The British empire became the global superpower of the 19th century. And the world speaks English, not French.” Although Britain was indeed the superpower, the international language continued to be French throughout the 19th century, and longer. English did not really become the global language until after the two world wars in the 20th century, and this trend accelerated with the rise of online culture. As late as the end of the 1960s, when I had finished high school and was considering a career in science, the advice of my teachers was to learn German. Don SiegelParis Opposites attract  SIR – One of your readers doesn't like the use of oxymorons in your newspaper (Letters, September 17th). And yet contradictory terms have become ingrained in the vernacular of economists. Professional dismal scientists have noted recently that “negative growth” is explained by “toxic assets”, but this will ultimately lead to “creative destruction”.

https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/24/as-a-pause-in-fighting-begins-husam-zomlot-calls-for-a-comprehensive-ceasefire,"THIS IS A defining moment, not only for Palestine, Israel and the broader Middle East, but for the international order and the world. The idea voiced in a recent Economist editorial that “a ceasefire is the enemy of peace” and would benefit Hamas is shocking and betrays an alarming lack of policy foresight and moral clarity. A comprehensive ceasefire—lasting in nature, unlike the pause for hostage releases that began today—would benefit peace. It would first benefit Palestinian civilians, who have endured unimaginable suffering in recent weeks. It would stop the spread of hostilities in the region. And it would open up a historic opportunity to treat the root cause of the conflict. Israel has allowed into Gaza only a tiny fraction of the water, food and fuel needed by its 2.3m people, prompting warnings from humanitarian organisations and the UN of starvation, thirst and infectious disease. An estimated 14,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, most of them women and children. There are tens of thousands of injuries. But there is nowhere to treat them. Israel has devastated Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, leaving just ten of its 36 hospitals functioning. Three out of every four Palestinians in Gaza have been forcibly displaced from their homes in the north of the territory and are crowding into UN facilities, schools and private houses in the south, where they have continued to be targeted by Israel’s bombardment and from where they are being pushed ever farther south. Whole neighbourhoods have been destroyed along with schools, universities, mosques, churches and UN facilities. The collective punishment of Palestinians is incomparable to any conflict in recent memory. More children were killed in three weeks in Gaza than the number of children killed in global conflict zones every year since 2019. More UN workers have been killed than in any similar period in the organisation’s 78-year history. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an NGO, the war in Gaza has been the deadliest for journalists covering conflict—in terms of the number of deaths over a given period—since it began tracking data in 1992. The violence is not confined to Gaza. In the West Bank more than 200 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th and extremist settlers, armed and empowered by Israel’s Jewish-supremacist public-security minister, are running amok, depopulating villages and terrorising local populations. Add to this the genocidal language from the highest leadership in Israel, where officials are openly discussing plans for the ethnic cleansing of the entire population of Gaza. Members of the Knesset have called for the use of nuclear weapons against Gaza, the defence minister dehumanised Palestinians as “human animals”,  the president said there are no innocent civilians in Gaza and the prime minister invoked a biblical reference, calling for a “holy war of annihilation”. These are not only war crimes, but a blueprint for ethnic cleansing that is designed to make Gaza unliveable. Is a ceasefire really the enemy of peace? Over more than seven decades Israel has not been held to account for its many transgressions of international law: not for its illegal settlement-building, its indiscriminate violence, the 16-year blockade of Gaza, the targeting of journalists; not for its use of deeply repressive measures such as detention without charge or trial, or collective punishments such as home demolitions; not for its system of racial domination, or apartheid, as documented by international, Israeli and Palestinian human-rights organisations; and not for its illegal annexation of East Jerusalem—nor, indeed, its refusal to allow Palestinian refugees their right of return after 75 years. Attempts by the State of Palestine to refer these crimes to the relevant international bodies, such as the International Criminal Court or the International Court of Justice, have been opposed by countries like America and Britain, further consolidating the sense that Israel is above international law and norms. The Palestine Liberation Organisation long ago took the strategic decision to pursue diplomacy to reach our aims of Palestinian statehood, freedom from occupation and the right of return of Palestinian refugees. But this strategy has so far proven a dead end. Even though the world outside Israel supports a two-state outcome, pressure on Israel to get there has been almost entirely absent over the 30 years since the Oslo accords. The Economist rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire but did point out that “Palestinians deserve a state, too.” It is not about “deserving”. This is our inalienable and an internationally sanctioned right, equal to all other peoples in the world, to live free and with self-determination on our own land. The idea that Hamas can be eradicated by military force is also misguided. Hamas is not just its military wing; it is an ideology. You can only challenge an idea by offering a different idea. The path to peace is clear. Recognise the State of Palestine on 1967 borders and end the occupation. That would leave two sovereign states to implement the new reality. The State of Palestine, with the help of the international community, would oversee the massive humanitarian and reconstruction efforts now necessary, provide protection and services to its citizens and convene national elections. This path is not easy. It does not require a lengthy process with interim agreements, but it does require a paradigm shift: an inversion of the Oslo process, establishing the end goal at the outset. It necessitates courage, statesmanship and the implementation of international law and resolutions. Soon we will be faced with a choice: we either wait for the next tragedy or we seize this moment to reach a lasting peace. ■ Husam Zomlot is the Palestinian ambassador to Britain."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/23/for-the-first-time-in-years-israels-leader-wants-a-palestinian-state,"Promises of peace are common. Yet Yair Lapid, Israel’s prime minister, caused a stir when he told the UN General Assembly on September 22nd that he wanted to make peace with Palestinians based on the “two-state solution”.  That plan itself is not new. It has been the basis for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians since the Oslo accords of 1993 and is supported by many governments around the world. It aims to divide the territory currently controlled by Israel into an Israeli state and a Palestinian one.  The previous time an Israeli leader mentioned the two-state solution at the UN was in 2015 when Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, grudgingly said he still supported it. Few, however, believed Mr Netanyahu was doing anything but currying favour with America’s president, Barack Obama, whose administration spent two terms trying to keep the peace process alive. Mr Lapid’s predecessor and coalition partner, Naftali Bennett, conspicuously failed even to mention the Palestinians in his UN speech last year. Mr Lapid has long supported the two-state solution, but he has only been prime minister since June 30th. His speech signals that the pro-peace camp in Israeli politics is not dead. It also reminds Israelis that they cannot forever ignore their country’s military occupation in the West Bank and the blockade it and Egypt impose on Gaza. So long as Palestinians are oppressed, Israel will be unsafe.  That said, Mr Lapid will have immense difficulty turning his words into actions. He is facing an election in less than six weeks and he is far behind Mr Netanyahu’s bloc in the polls. Even the outgoing coalition Mr Lapid currently leads (and would need to rebuild after the election if he were to stay in power) includes influential members who adamantly oppose the creation of a Palestinian state. Gideon Saar, the justice minister and a key ally, said Mr Lapid’s vision would “endanger Israeli’s safety” and that “most Israeli people and their representatives will not allow that to happen.” On this second point, he may be right. In his speech Mr Lapid claimed that a large majority of Israelis supported his aims. But recent polling suggests they do not. In a survey carried out by Tel Aviv University in July, only 40% of Israelis supported a two-state solution, while 50% were against it. What Mr Lapid could truthfully have said is that there is even less support for the three alternatives: a single bi-national state in which all inhabitants have equal rights; Israeli annexation of the West Bank and the official subjugation of the Palestinians; or keeping the situation as it is. Palestinians, for their part, are no more keen on the two-state solution than Israelis.  Even if there was the political and public support to revive the Oslo peace process, many observers believe that it is no longer practical to create two states. Even if one excludes Jewish suburbs in east Jerusalem, which would probably be included in the Israeli state, almost half a million Israeli settlers now live in the occupied West Bank. Since it would not be possible to move that many people, many observers think that any future solution would have to be based on what is in many ways already a one-state reality.  Since becoming prime minister, Mr Lapid has not made any attempt to negotiate with the Palestinian leadership. One problem is that he has no one to talk to. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, was elected in 2005 and has since refused to hold presidential elections. Any deal reached with him would lack legitimacy. Mr Lapid’s speech does not seem to have been aimed at foreign powers or at the Palestinians. Rather, his intended audience is probably Israelis thinking about the general election scheduled for November 1st. Since his main rival will be Mr Netanyahu, who leads a bloc of right-wing and religious parties firmly opposed to letting the Palestinians have a state, Mr Lapid is anxious to establish his own party, Yesh Atid, as the best choice for dovish voters. In doing so, he is making the coming election something of a referendum on trying to make peace.■"
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2016/05/12/israels-villa-in-the-jungle,"SURPRISINGLY, PERHAPS, ISRAEL claims to be taking no sides in the Syrian conflict that rages in full sight of its outposts on the Golan Heights. If shot at it will shoot back; anyone smuggling advanced weapons to Hizbullah in Lebanon will be a fair target; and if Hizbullah comes too close to the Golan border, it will also be hit. For the most part, though, Israel’s view is best summed up by a quip in 1980 by Israel’s then prime minister, Menachem Begin, on the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war: “We wish both sides the greatest success.” Israeli security folk see much good news in the Arab world’s convulsions. Israel’s deterrence is holding. No state directly threatens it. There is no Syrian army to speak of; Iran’s nuclear programme has probably been neutralised for a decade or more by its accord with America; and Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi is the most pro-Israeli Egyptian leader ever. Friendly Arab monarchies have survived and are moving towards a tacit alliance with Israel against Iran. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The nationalist Fatah movement that rules the West Bank is at daggers drawn with Hamas, which holds Gaza. Both are co-operating (up to a point in the case of Hamas) to prevent attacks on Israel. At a time when the frontiers of the Middle East are being questioned as never before, the “1967 border”, which defines the Israeli-occupied territories, might become less inviolable (Israel says the world should now recognise its annexation of the Golan). Verily, says one securocrat, this is a land of miracles. Yet there are still worries aplenty. Radical factions in the ungoverned spaces around Israel might turn their guns on it. Jordan, which implicitly protects Israel’s flank to the east, may yet be consumed by turmoil all around. And by saving the Syrian regime, Russia is strengthening Israel’s arch-foe, Iran. Arabs, too, recognise that events are favouring Israel. Some otherwise sensible Arabs even suspect that the turbulence, including the emergence of Islamic State, are all somehow part of a Zionist conspiracy. That said, these days conversations about the state of the Arab world can go on for hours before the word “Palestine” is uttered. Compared with his ever more right-wing coalition, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, comes across as a moderate. He pays some lip service to the “two-state solution”, the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (and part of Jerusalem) alongside Israel, but the “peace process” is at a dead end. Many in his government say this is no time for territorial concessions. Palestinians retort that the failure to reach a just settlement is sure to feed radicalism. Never mind that the Arab world’s attention may be turned away from Palestine, says Husam Zomlot, a senior Palestinian official: “Israel has 99% of the day-to-day cards, but the Palestinians have the strategic cards.” The occupied land Palestinians claim is disappearing under Israeli roads and settlements in the West Bank. But the Palestinians are winning what some call the “battle of the womb”. The number of Arabs between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river (in Israel and the occupied territories) roughly equals that of Jews, at about 6.3m each, and may soon overtake it. If Israel holds on to the occupied territories permanently, it cannot be both a full democracy and a Jewish state; the comparisons with apartheid are bound to intensify. An idea gaining strength among the pro-settler nationalist-religious right is to allow Gaza to become near-independent, even with its own sea port. That would hive off nearly 2m Palestinians. Some think Hamas might just be tempted to take this opportunity to claim an achievement after three damaging wars with Israel since 2008. All this might explain why Israeli right-wingers are, unusually, complaining that Mr Sisi has been too tough on the Palestinians by cutting traffic and tunnels between Gaza and the restive Sinai peninsula. Just as some Israelis want to turn Gaza into Palestine, Egypt is dumping it back in Israel’s lap."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2015/02/12/the-king-of-cauliflowers,"IT MAY challenge the spirit to think of cauliflower as anything but an overrated, ungainly plant. But in the craggy land between Ramallah and Jerusalem, there is one variety of that plain vegetable that invariably attracts a crazed following at this time of year. Every winter stands manned by farmers pop up along most of the West Bank’s winding roads, with proud growers displaying vivid yellow bouquets wreathed in green roughage. Forget the white vegetable that, when boiled, resembles a brain and releases a gassy aroma redolent of cheap cafeterias. This is zahara baladi, an ancient local cultivar that takes a full year to grow and is in season for just a few weeks. The plant has a nice, mustardy hue; the flavour is well-rounded, sweet and earthy and the texture irresistibly creamy. All this is enough to entice Palestinian Jerusalemites to leave their homes in blustery weather. “It’s cauliflower madness,” one customer agreed cheerfully as he battled a vicious wind to get to a stall. Their craze reflects not just the brief flowering of a delicacy, but also a gastronomic renaissance brought about by successful Ramallah chefs, many of them trained abroad, and a bumper crop of recent books highlighting local cooking. Cauliflower has been mentioned by Arab botanists for more than a millennium. It is the crucial ingredient in maqluba, a gem of Palestinian cuisine in which fried florets are cooked with chicken or lamb (and sometimes eggplant) in a huge pot of spiced rice that is triumphantly turned upside down before serving. Translated literally, zahara baladi means wild flower, and it usually makes its appearance some time in February, just as the terraced hills erupt in a riot of colourful blooms. “This is the golden time of flowering plants,” exults Munir Nasser, a professor of biochemistry at Birzeit University with a passion for local flora. Commercial vegetable growers sometimes try to engineer their plants so as to produce saleable crops twice a year. But purists will always insist on the existing variety of zahara baladi. Local lore ascribes amazing properties to the plant. It is said to cure everything from respiratory ailments to postnatal pain. In villages, chunks of the stuff are artfully combined with onion and spices and blended into a light dough that is fried, producing an appetising fritter. In Jerusalem, families wait eagerly till winter to make mtafayeh—a one-pot wonder consisting of lamb and zahara baladi cooked with goat yogurt, tahini, lemon and fresh minced garlic. “The taste is just different, so good, so soft,” sighs a Jerusalem lawyer and new mother who has just dispatched her husband on a mission to the cauliflower kiosks. Her name, appropriately, is Zahara."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2008/05/08/the-wandering-palestinian,"NAHR AL-BARED in Lebanon was a wind-blown huddle of tents when the first refugees straggled here from Galilee in 1948, the year of the Palestinian nakba or catastrophe. Yet the camp somehow prospered, in spite of the Lebanese laws restricting Palestinians, and despite the influx of yet more refugees during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. By last year it had grown into a crowded but congenial town of 35,000, complete with apartment blocks, schools and clinics. The seaside camp was home to the busiest market in northern Lebanon, but also to a growing band of dour, bearded and fearsomely well-armed Islamist radicals. They hailed mostly not from Palestine but from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria and other countries that were making life difficult for jihad-obsessed Sunni militants. Nahr al-Bared's regular residents tended to shun them. But there was little they could do to keep the 500 or so newcomers out. The feeble Lebanese state takes no responsibility for its 12 Palestinian camps, and the refugees' own institutions have weakened with the decline of the once-dominant Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Last May police in the nearby city of Tripoli clashed with members of the group. Their comrades took revenge by attacking Lebanese army posts, then retreated into Nahr al-Bared. Worried by the addition of al-Qaeda-style radicals to Lebanon's boiling sectarian stew, the army responded with fury. Its siege of Nahr al-Bared lasted 106 days, during which the camp's entire population was forced to flee and watch their homes being pounded into dust by artillery fire. By the time the Lebanese army declared victory in September, some 47 civilians, 167 Lebanese soldiers and a claimed 287 armed guerrillas were dead. The camp is slowly reviving. Ten thousand residents have returned to the less damaged outlying areas. The owner of a makeshift café on the rutted main street has painted a jaunty sign in rainbow colours. “We Shall Rebuild Al Bared and We Shall Return To Palestine”, it promises.  Yet the utterly flattened centre of the camp, which housed 20,000 refugees, remains off-limits. Yasser al-Hajj, a 27-year-old engineer whose family came here from Safad in northern Palestine (now part of Israel), takes a break from shovelling rubble out of a friend's wall-less living room to point towards one of a dozen tilted stacks of collapsed concrete that loom just beyond a Lebanese army checkpoint. The four-storey building contained all his extended family's belongings, as well as their wholesale grocery business, the fruit of 60 years' struggle in exile. Mr al-Hajj assumes they have lost everything. “This is my generation's nakba,” he says dryly. Such bitterness is widely shared among the world's 10m Palestinians, 70% of whom are refugees or their descendants. Other peoples have suffered great tragedies, but the Palestinians' trauma not only refuses to reach closure, it has a horrible habit of repeating itself. Worse yet, its effects continue to poison politics within the wider region and beyond. In annual polling over the past six years, three-quarters of Arabs consistently place the issue of Palestine among their priorities.  In other words, little has changed since 1948, when street sentiment prompted five reluctant Arab governments to send troops on a vain mission to block the creation of Israel. During the ensuing war, the Palestinians' initial nakba, more than half the native population of Palestine, some 750,000 people, fled or were driven from the territory that became the Jewish state, whose troops then barred their return and systematically razed 531 of their ancestral villages. The six-day war in June 1967 brought the remaining 22% of historic Palestine under Israeli rule, and pushed out 250,000 more refugees. In exile, Palestinians have been harassed, attacked or chased away. PLO fighters were forced to flee Jordan after an uprising in 1970. Lebanese Christians destroyed the camps of Tel Zaatar and Qarantina in the 1970s, and massacred Palestinians at Sabra and Chatila in 1982. Israelis besieged the PLO in Beirut the same year, sending PLO leaders to secondary exile in Tunis, and the Syrians did the same in Tripoli in 1984. In 1991 300,000 Palestinians, many of them wealthy and long-settled, were hounded from Kuwait after their leaders foolishly praised Saddam Hussein's invasion of the Gulf emirate. Libya's erratic ruler, Muammar Qaddafi, deported thousands more in the 1990s, saying that since they had signed the Oslo peace accords with Israel, Palestinians should “go home”. Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, nearly all its 20,000 Palestinians have been forced to the borders, where some still languish in dusty desert camps. It is a testimony to the tenacity of Palestinians that they have kept alive a sense of nationhood in the face of so much adversity. Yet the obstacles to sustaining their cohesiveness as a people are today greater than ever.  Around 5m Palestinians live in historic Palestine, under Israeli control. In the West Bank, Israeli settlements and military zones take up 40% of the land. In response to the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, that began in 2000, Israel laced the territory with walls, fences and checkpoints that box its 2.5m Palestinian residents into dozens of largely separate enclaves. Since the Islamist party, Hamas, took control of Gaza last June, its 1.5m people have been confined within the strip's 146 square miles (378 sq km), kept alive on a drip-feed sustenance of international aid. The 1.1m Palestinians inside Israel are far better off, though they have long suffered legal and economic discrimination. They are increasingly isolated from their brethren. Israel bars them, as its citizens, from travelling to Gaza or to most Arab countries, and their cousins in the occupied territories are unable to visit them since Israel, to keep suicide bombers out, has cancelled most permits.  Right-wing Jewish Israeli politicians stir up rhetoric about Palestinian Israelis as “fifth columnists”. Small wonder that in a recent poll 62% of them expressed the fear that Israel would one day expel them. The 250,000 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in 1967, have Israeli residence permits. But if they move to the West Bank or travel abroad to work, they risk losing for ever their right to live in the city of their birth. Outside historic Palestine the picture is mixed. Most Palestinians in Jordan enjoy Jordanian citizenship and hence relative freedom, though their voting power is diluted by blatant gerrymandering in favour of “East Bankers”, the original Jordanians. Lebanon, Syria and Egypt grant Palestinians not passports but a laissez-passer that immigration officers tend to regard with suspicion. That aside, Syria, with its pan-Arab Baathist ideology, gives its 450,000 Palestinians almost all the rights of citizens except the right to vote, which is not much use in a dictatorship anyhow.  By contrast, Lebanon, out of fears that naturalising the country's 350,000 Palestinians, most of them Sunni Muslims, would tip the delicate sectarian power balance, denies them the right to own property or to work in dozens of white-collar professions. Even if they are third-generation refugees in Lebanon, they risk losing their right to re-entry if they stay abroad longer than six months. Egypt, home to just 70,000 Palestinians, is slightly kinder. Palestinians may travel for up to a year, if they get special permits. But Egyptian authorities are notoriously pernickety. Lana Baydas, a British-educated professor at the American University in Cairo, has waited 18 months for residency papers, during which time she has had to fly 18 times to Syria, the only country she can travel freely to on her Syrian-Palestinian laissez-passer, so as not to outstay her month-long Egyptian “tourist” visas. When she tried to explain the bother to a friend, she says ruefully, the reply was, “Can't you just stop being Palestinian?” Ironically, it is Palestinians in the farther shattat or diaspora, beyond the Arab world, who feel the most secure. Antonio Saca, the president of El Salvador, is one of the 100,000 Salvadoreans of Palestinian origin, most of them Bethlehemites who left to escape the collapsing Ottoman empire almost a century ago. There are at least 300,000 Palestinian-Chileans, composed of various waves of emigration. America has maybe a quarter of a million Palestinians, mostly middle-class professionals, and there is a similar-sized but more recent émigré population in Europe, where it has been easier for new exiles to find refuge. Distance and borders are not the only things that divide Palestinians. There are also stark, and growing, gaps between rich and poor, between secularists, Muslims and Christians, between myriad political factions—and between refugees, non-refugees and ex-refugees. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is responsible for the welfare of the 4.5m registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East. Around half of the Palestinians in the occupied territories, including most of the people in Gaza, are refugees; about a quarter of Palestinian Israelis also lost their original homes. Living conditions vary enormously. In the West Bank, only about a third of the refugees live in camps, and even there UNRWA tents have long since been replaced by tightly packed slum housing. Refugees are fiercely proud of their status, with even the rich and successful clinging to their identity. They may buy large villas, but often next to the camps. The 20,000 inhabitants of Balata camp, at the edge of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, still speak with the accent of villages in what is now Israel, even if they are second- or third-generation camp-dwellers. When UNRWA offered to buy land to house refugees outside Jenin's refugee camp after parts of it were flattened by Israeli bulldozers, the residents refused. Similarly, Nahr al-Bared's homeless residents are lobbying to ensure that when their camp is rebuilt, it will still be sectioned into districts named for the Galilee villages the original refugees came from. In Jordan's capital, Amman, the rich and often secular Palestinians who live on the hilltops shun the religiously conservative poor whose houses pack the slopes and valleys. West Bank city-dwellers still shudder at the memory of an influx of job-seeking Gazans during the 1990s, before Israel severed links between the territories. The traditionally more affluent Palestinian Christians have been the likeliest to emigrate, becoming an ever smaller minority, and sometimes a persecuted one as militant Islamism has grown in strength.  An Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, famously jibed in 1968 that “there is no such thing as the Palestinian people.” Respectable historians now accept that Palestinian nationhood began to form in the 19th century. But at the time of the nakba their sense of nationhood was still more tenuous than that of the Jews two millennia ago, who went into exile with a dense religious tradition and centuries of biblical self-rule already under their belts. The world's diverse Palestinian communities are tied together less by history than by the narrative of dispossession and the dream of returning home.  For all his failings, Yasser Arafat, who headed the PLO and its dominant faction, the secular Fatah party, from 1969 until his death in 2004, can be credited with maintaining and strengthening the Palestinians' fragile identity. And he did so while engineering the shift in their aspirations that made peace with Israel a conceptual possibility—a shift from hankering after all-too-tangible lost land to the much more abstract promise of a nation-state, on a much smaller bit of that land.  But in 1993 Mr Arafat made what most Palestinians now regard as the error of agreeing to the Oslo peace accords, which gave no firm promise of a Palestinian state in return for the recognition of Israel, and which eventually collapsed after the failure of talks at Camp David in the summer of 2000. Many conflict-weary Palestinians would have been satisfied with simply having a passport and a secure place to call home. But to the poorer refugees, Oslo smelt of a sell-out. As Jewish settlement in the West Bank accelerated, the newly installed Palestinian Authority grew more corrupt and negotiations collapsed into bloodshed, ever more Palestinians rejected Arafat's brand of nationalism and turned to Hamas. The credo of Hamas, born in 1987 as an offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, is the recuperation of all of historic Palestine for Islam, though over the years it has come to accept the idea of a “long-term” (several decades, say its leaders) truce with Israel. Hamas built its credibility through social programmes, a reputation for honesty and its rejection of a peace process that it saw biased in Israel's favour. AP  But when will this lovely land really be his state? Many of the Palestinians who voted Hamas into power in the 2006 parliamentary elections did so not because they agreed with its ideology but just because Fatah was so awful. Fatah's subsequent, American-backed effort to destabilise the new government only added to Hamas's lustre, and prompted the Islamists to undertake what they regard, with some justification, as a pre-emptive coup in Gaza last summer. Israel's attempts to suppress Hamas have backfired. The result of its blockade on Gaza is that an opinion poll in February showed the Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, beating the Fatah chairman, Mahmoud Abbas, for the presidency for the first time ever. Palestinian deaths since the start of the second intifada stand at over 4,700 and rising, while hundreds of thousands have been impoverished, further hardening attitudes towards Israel. The latest peace talks, launched at Annapolis last November, have changed little on the ground. A growing number of Palestinians seem persuaded that Israel has so entrenched itself in the West Bank that a two-state solution is already out of reach. Around a quarter now say they favour a binational state with equal rights for all—which most Jewish Israelis would never accept. This too is to Hamas's advantage. Its political opponents base their position on secularism and the two-state idea—and both values are eroding. Rumblings of dissent have emerged from within Fatah too, placing pressure on Mr Abbas to toughen his negotiating stance. “If Abu Mazen [Mr Abbas] agrees to anything without the right of return for all refugees, then there will be an intifada of the refugees,” says Shami Shami, a Fatah member of parliament from the Jenin refugee camp. Talk of the “right of return” sets alarms ringing in Israel: if all the refugees returned, Israel would be swamped and Jews would no longer be a majority. In practice, Mr Shami, like most politicians in Fatah, subscribes to a known formula: the conflict must be resolved along the lines of UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of 1948, which states that “the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date,” and decrees that compensation should be paid to the rest.  The biggest poll on how many refugees would actually choose to return was done in 2003 by Khalil Shikaki, a leading Palestinian pollster. He asked refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon if, given the choice, they would go to Israel, go to (or stay in) a Palestinian state, or take citizenship elsewhere. Those who did not go to Israel would get compensation. Overall, 10% said they would want to move to Israel (it was 23% in Lebanon and 5% in Jordan, reflecting the differing conditions of refugees there). Some challenge Mr Shikaki's findings, partly because he added the stipulation that return would be limited to a quota agreed to by Israel, which would undoubtedly be minuscule: informal figures of 10,000 a year have been bandied about, half the current rate of Jewish immigration. More might opt for return if they felt there was a reasonable chance of getting it. Even so, the poll suggests that for most Palestinians recognition of their legal “right” is more important than physical “return”. Full return is unrealistic, agrees Abbas Shiblak, who founded SHAML, a refugee research centre in Ramallah. “But we can't renounce the right of return because it means we accept the Israeli narrative and version of history, which no one will accept.” Not that compensation for the rest would be a minor obstacle. The Aix Group, an Israeli-Palestinian-French economic study team, estimates that a fair package of resettlement or rehabilitation for the 4.5m registered refugees would run to between $55 billion and $85 billion. Given the tangled mess of responsibilities, foreign countries would be expected to stump up. At present, though, even a decent settlement over the land, let alone the refugees, looks a very long way away. Mr Abbas, presiding over only part of the putative Palestinian state—and that precariously—is in no position to take the steps that Israel demands of him to implement a peace deal. Ehud Olmert, Israel's prime minister, cannot concede an inch without incurring the wrath of rightists. The two sides are currently negotiating what the Israelis have already downgraded to a “framework agreement” rather than a full peace deal discussed at Annapolis. The prognosis is poor. But if, against all expectation, they should agree on, say, the exact amount of land that Israel is prepared to relinquish in the West Bank and Gaza, even without specifying the shape of the border, it could make this sad 60th anniversary of the nakba almost celebratory. "
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2013/03/16/could-two-become-one,"IN 1942, as the Holocaust in Europe was entering its most horrific phase, a pacifist American rabbi called Judah Magnes helped found a political party in Palestine called Ihud. Hebrew for unity, Ihud argued for a single binational state in the Holy Land to be shared by Jews and Arabs. Its efforts—and those of like-minded idealists—came to naught. Bitterly opposed to the partition of Palestine, Magnes died in 1948 just as the state of Israel—the naqba, or catastrophe, to Palestinians—was being born. Decades of strife were to follow. At the United Nations, in the White House and around the world, there is a strong belief that any solution ending that strife must be based on two separate states, with a mainly Jewish one called Israel sitting alongside a mainly Arab one called Palestine. The border between them would be based on the one that existed before the 1967 war—known as the “green line”—with some adjustments and land swaps to reflect the world as it is. Jerusalem would be a shared but divided capital. In the face of the manifold obstacles facing such a solution, however, something like Magnes’s one-state variant has been coming back into vogue, both in left-wing Western (and Jewish) circles and among a growing minority of Palestinians. In 2004 a British-born Israeli writer, Daniel Gavron, published a book, “The Other Side of Despair: Jews and Arabs in the Promised Land”, that called for the creation of a democratic binational “State of Jerusalem”. Some Israeli intellectuals are airing the notion of “Post-Zionism”. Avraham Burg, a former Speaker of the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, says a “post-national” model must be explored. “I have no doubt something is emerging, though I am not sure what it is.” Avi Shlaim, a leading British chronicler of the Israel-Palestine saga who was born in Baghdad and brought up in Israel, says he has “shifted…to supporting a one-state solution with equal rights for all citizens,” though he concedes that “this is not what I would ideally like.” Past and present Israeli governments, he thinks, have killed the two-state option, partly by entrenching Jewish settlements so deeply on the West Bank, the heartland of a would-be Palestinian state, that they cannot be removed. This is an assessment the idealists share with hawkish Israelis and a growing number of Palestinians. More and more often, the two-state solution is pronounced dead. Mathematics suggests that the alternative is a one-state solution. But though there are a lot of different one-state outcomes under discussion, none of them really looks like a solution. If one state is simply the rejection of two states, then many Israelis on the right are up for it. In 2009, under American pressure, Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he grudgingly endorsed the two-state idea. Since then he has shown barely a flicker of enthusiasm for it. In a speech to the American Congress in May 2011, he declared triumphantly, and to sustained applause, that Jerusalem would be undivided, evidently under Israeli control, noting that “the vast majority of the 650,000 Israelis who live beyond the 1967 lines reside in neighbourhoods and suburbs of Jerusalem and Greater Tel Aviv.” Yet it is barely conceivable that the Palestinians would ever accept a state that excluded all of Jerusalem. Mr Netanyahu has made clear that he will not countenance the bulk of the West Bank’s settlers being pushed out in order to let the Palestinians have their state. And he is emphatic that Israel must control the Jordan valley as well as the airspace above the Palestinians; their West Bank state would exist under an Israeli lid. “He never made a clear-cut commitment to the two-state solution,” says Mr Netanyahu’s predecessor as prime minister, Ehud Olmert. Regardless of Mr Netanyahu’s position, his Likud party has refused to endorse the creation of any kind of Palestinian state. Most of its Knesset members have joined a “Greater Israel Caucus” that says the West Bank must stay part of Israel for ever. Avigdor Lieberman, a rough-hewn populist whose largely ethnic-Russian party merged with Likud before the election, backs partition but also wants to encourage the fifth of Israeli citizens who are Arabs living within Israel’s 1967 boundary to leave—ethnic cleansing, in Palestinian eyes. Arab Israelis who fail a “test of loyalty” to the state of Israel should, he says, be deprived of various rights, such as the vote. Mr Lieberman is currently out of office, pending an investigation into alleged fraud, but the 31 seats held together by his party and Likud is easily the biggest bloc in the 120-seat Knesset. Naftali Bennett, a 40-year-old software tycoon with a hip Californian manner, is the most strident new voice on the Israeli right: blunter than Mr Netanyahu, more openly dismissive of the two-state idea, and more hawkish than another, bigger beneficiary of Israeli voters in January’s general election, Yair Lapid. (Mr Lapid’s party won 19 seats in the Knesset to Mr Bennett’s 12.) Asked about removing Jewish settlements from the West Bank and creating a Palestinian state between Jerusalem and the Jordan river, Mr Bennett breezily replies that “It just ain’t gonna happen.” Of the Palestinians, he says “I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state. It would be national suicide for Israel.” Instead, Mr Bennett wants Israel to annex the 61% of the West Bank known as “Area C” (see map), in essence the territory’s central and eastern slab, going down to the Jordan valley. The Palestinians—at least 50,000—who live there would become Israeli citizens, should they stay. The other 2.6m or so Palestinians on the West Bank would have to be content with “full-blown autonomy” in their towns and villages. This, in essence, would mean municipal rights (he mentions garbage collection). Jewish settlers would stay put. Mr Lapid, a jovial former television anchorman now deemed a kingmaker in the Knesset, is considered a centrist by Israelis. But he is no enthusiast for a two-state plan, at least not of the sort promoted by Western diplomats or in the UN. He chose to make his chief election speech at the university of Ariel, one of the largest and most controversial of Jewish settlements, a town of 20,000 people (with another 12,000 students) built deep within the West Bank. The second person on his party’s list in the Knesset is a settler rabbi. Mr Lapid also argues for Jerusalem to remain undivided under Israeli control. The only mainly Jewish parties that treat negotiations towards a two-state solution as a priority are Tzipi Livni’s group (which won a paltry six seats in the recent election), Meretz (which also got six) and the rump of Ariel Sharon’s Kadima party (just two). Three Arab-Israeli parties, all two-staters, got 11 seats between them. The Labour Party, long Israel’s leading proponent of a two-state solution, got 15 seats. But its campaign concentrated almost exclusively on domestic issues. Indeed, the degree to which the election and its coalition-cobbling aftermath ignored negotiations with the Palestinians to any end at all was telling. Mr Bennett’s provocative no-state-for-the-Palestinians oratory was noticed. But he was never rebuked for it by, say, Mr Netanyahu. In sum, despite Mr Netanyahu’s glum espousal of the two-state idea in his speech at Bar-Ilan, proponents of a state of Israel that encompasses all or most of the West Bank are plainly the strongest force in the Knesset. On March 14th, Mr Netanyahu announced a proposed government in advance of a visit by Barack Obama on March 20th. It contains Mr Lapid and Mr Bennett; Ms Livni will probably be its only member keenly committed to negotiations with the Palestinians. Within Israel, the Palestinian question simply does not seem urgent. Even the settlers do not seem to feel threatened. With a web of well-built roads knitting their infrastructure into that of Israel proper—some of them reserved for Israeli use—a visitor barely notices which side of the green line he is on. Those living in the settlements have scant contact with Palestinians whose villages lie close by. In 2012, for the first year since 1973, not a single Jewish Israeli was killed as a result of Palestinian violence on the West Bank. Palestinians, for their part, talk more and more of “a one-state reality”—while most caution that it is not a “solution”. They argue that the notion of a viable, contiguous, sovereign Palestinian state sitting peacefully alongside Israel is no longer feasible. An ever more popular parallel for the situation is South Africa before and after its emergence from apartheid. The main similarity is the existence of two separate systems of government and law for two people living side by side on territory that is occupied as a result of conquest and confiscation. The web of Israeli roads and the restrictions that Palestinians face in terms of travel are compared to the sequestering of black South Africans in wretched “bantustans”. Israel’s security fence, in many places a five-metre (15-foot) concrete wall wound round Jewish settlements is inevitably known to Palestinians as “the apartheid wall”. Scores of checkpoints recall the old South African “pass laws” whereby blacks needed permission to go from one area to another, especially in search of work in “white” areas. The campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel, which is growing in strength in America and Britain, sees the one-state reality as a precursor to a civil-rights movement that would then bring down the “apartheid state” with the help, as in South Africa, of external support inflamed by the injustice. If Jewish settlers were determined to remain on the West Bank, they might be able to do so—but under Palestinian authority. Israel’s president, Shimon Peres, and its former prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert—men in what used to be the mainstream of national politics—worry about just such a future. They have warned that, unless the occupation of the bulk of the West Bank ends, or Palestinians in the West Bank are given full voting rights in Israel, the country will lose its claim to be a democracy. It will, says Mr Peres, become a “pariah”, just as South Africa did. The BDS campaign may thus, he implies, become unstoppable. Even the Americans might find it hard to go on backing Israel come hell or high water. More hawkish Palestinians, typified by the Islamist movement, Hamas, are not giving up on a two-state solution; they never believed in it in the first place. They still dream of a land where they hold sway from the Mediterranean to the Jordan river, with Jews and Christians living there, if they are lucky, on sufferance. Accepting that this harsh scenario is unlikely to come to pass in the short run, its proponents talk merrily of the long game, waiting for a generation or even two. These true-believing one-staters have a strong position in Hamas, and it is one that will likely get stronger if people like Mr Bennett call the Israeli tune. “We consider the whole of Palestine our land,” says Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader in Gaza, sitting at home beside a portrait of two sons killed fighting the Israelis. History and time, he says with a big smile, are on Hamas’s side. “The Islamic trend is coming to power. Ten years is enough to neutralise the power of Israel and its supporters.” An Islamist regime has come to power next-door in Egypt; Syria may be next; Hamas’s allies in Jordan are shaking King Abdullah’s throne. “No one can guess what will happen tomorrow.” “In the end I am sure there will be just one state,” says Basam al-Naim, for seven years Hamas’s minister of health in Gaza. “But what kind of state I cannot say. Many Jews would leave and many Palestinians would come back. In ten to 20 years there will be a completely different geopolitical map.” The 1m-odd Russian Jews who have bolstered Israel since the Soviet Union collapsed, he says, would have to go. “They are already segregated in Israel,” he adds. “And many of them are not even Jews.” Over the years, some Hamas leaders, such as Khaled Meshal, have groped towards accepting Israel, at least as a “reality” to be grudgingly accepted. Some now posit a two-state solution, albeit often as a step on the way to a single state, once Muslims, Jews and Christians learn to live happily together, perhaps in some federal halfway house. In every one-state outcome, be it created by virtue of persuasion or under duress, Jews would eventually be a minority (see chart). Mr Bennett seeks to avoid this by advocating “autonomy” outside Israel for much of the West Bank. But he must know that the autonomy he advocates will never satisfy the Palestinians, nor the neighbouring Arab countries that host several million Palestinian refugees, most of whose forebears fled when Israel was founded in 1948. “I do not have a clear-cut solution,” he concedes, before reverting to the old argument that “Jordan is Palestine.” Most Jordanians, it is true, are of Palestinian origin. But would Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza, let alone those within the borders of Israel, be satisfied with a state on the east side of the Jordan river, presuming that the present monarchy would grant it to them? Not a chance. Though Mr Bennett might want them to, the Egyptians aren’t going to let Gaza be dumped on them, either. But, like the activists of BDS, Mr Bennett and his friends know that granting Palestinians proper civil rights within an enlarged Israel would mean that the Jews would soon be outnumbered and later outvoted by the Palestinians. Though ultra-Orthodox Jews are the fastest growing community in Israel, Palestinians still outbreed Israelis as a whole. Palestinians in Israel already add up to 1.6m, along with 2.6m on the West Bank and 1.7m in Gaza. Jewish Israelis on both sides of the green line number about 6m. “In ten to 15 years Palestinians would have a majority in one state,” says Mr Olmert. This means that none of the one-state options makes sense for Israel in the long run. The idealists paint a picture of Arabs and Jews getting along swimmingly together: dream on. The hawks think the Palestinians can be kept quiet for ever if they are denied a state: again, dream on. At the same time, the analogy with South Africa is fatally flawed. Israel within its 1967 borders has international legitimacy; no white South African state could ever have claimed as much; beyond a few Afrikaner zealots the idea would have been a non-starter. So a two-state solution was never possible. And a situation in which blacks outnumber whites by ten to one is completely unlike a situation where the sides have comparable numbers. In conceding the principle of one-person-one-vote South Africa’s whites knew that they were losing their political primacy for good. Israeli Jews will not do that. Even if the Palestinians were remarkably tolerant—and that is questionable—Israel as a Jewish state would disappear. Even the name would go. It is barely conceivable that Jews, after running their own vibrant polity for half a century and praying for a return to their ancestral homeland for two millennia, would quietly submit to Palestinian majority rule, however idealistic its proponents. That is why Dov Khenin, a Jewish member of the Knesset’s mainly Arab and communist-inclined Hadash party, sees two states as the only practical path to peace even while sympathising with the ideals of the one-staters. “If the two peoples want to have a binational state, OK,” he says wistfully. “But my impression is that Israelis and Palestinians don’t very much like each other.” Nor, he implies, will they ever do so. Academic gatherings, such as a conference last year at Harvard to discuss the one-state option, have yet to put flesh on the idealists’ notions. Would a federal framework provide for separate assemblies? What sort of army and police would there be? Would, as Mr Gavron’s book suggests, the Jews have to drop their Law of Return (allowing any diaspora Jew to become a citizen) and the Palestinians likewise have to drop their Right of Return (letting all refugees and their descendants back)? Few have begun to address such nettlesome questions, because in truth, few see a one-state outcome as a true goal. Most come to it out of exhausted despair or amiable fantasy. Israel, as Mr Netanyahu must know, cannot remain both democratic and Jewish if it continues to control several million Palestinians without granting them full political rights. At the same time, he dreads the encirclement of hostile Arab states around him, and frets that America, under Barack Obama, may fail to make good on its promise to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile he lamely repeats the old mantra that “there is no Palestinian partner for peace.” Quite possibly he does not know what he should, can or will do. Had Mitt Romney won the American presidency, he might have given Mr Netanyahu a fillip. Mr Obama has no such desire. Instead, he will repeat to the Israeli leader what Mr Netanyahu has almost said but cannot bring himself fully to endorse—that there is no serious alternative to a two-state deal."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/12/07/despite-the-war-in-gaza-talk-of-a-two-state-solution-persists,"BRUTAL and distressing, for sure, but perhaps the war between Israel and Hamas could also be an opportunity. That was how America’s president saw it, at least. Though he backed Israel’s right to defend itself, he argued that the fighting should be a wake-up call for Israelis and Palestinians alike. “The moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people,” he said in a televised interview. The president, in this case, was a newly inaugurated Barack Obama almost 15 years ago. But it could just as well be Joe Biden today. History has a way of repeating itself in the Middle East. War in Gaza has once again led to talk of peace, which may seem far-fetched, given the massacre of more than 1,200 Israelis on October 7th and the subsequent killing of some 16,000 Palestinians during the Israeli assault on Gaza. The Holy Land has not seen this much bloodshed since Israel was founded in 1948. Peace has never seemed so far away. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas. Mr Biden hopes it will emerge nonetheless. “When this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next, and in our view it has to be a two-state solution,” he said in October. At a conference in Bahrain in November, one Arab official after another offered a similar message. “We need to go back to a two-state solution, to an Israeli and Palestinian state living side by side,” said Anwar Gargash, an adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some see such talk as a fig leaf, intended to dispel misgivings about Western support for Israel and Arab inaction amid a horrifying war. After all, the 30-year peace process between Israelis and Palestinians is littered with failures. A revival of negotiations would be doomed from the start without, at the very least, three essential changes. First is new leadership. The political parties on either side of the current war in Gaza are the same ones that laboured to spoil the nascent peace process 30 years ago; they must go. Next is an effort to make the negotiations credible: both sides are ever more doubtful about the other’s sincerity. Last, both sides need incentives to make a deal. Palestinians need to feel that their state is viable, and Israelis need to feel that theirs will be secure. The two-state solution has been around, in one form or another, for almost a century. The United Nations adopted a partition plan for Palestine in 1947 that would have created two states, one Arab and one Jewish, with international control of Jerusalem. Arab states rejected it, Israel declared independence, and its neighbours promptly invaded. After decades of conflict, Israelis and Palestinians began talks at a peace conference in Madrid in 1991. Then came the Oslo accords in 1993, which set a five-year deadline to create a Palestinian state and in the meantime established the Palestinian Authority (PA), a government of sorts, albeit with limited powers and jurisdiction over only part of the occupied territories. A string of failures followed: the summits at Camp David and Taba, the Bush administration’s “road map for peace”, Mr Obama’s diplomacy. The last direct talks collapsed in 2014 and were never resuscitated. All along, the outline of a two-state solution changed little. There would be a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank—around 22% of the area of historic Palestine—with its capital in east Jerusalem. Israel would keep some settlements in the West Bank, in exchange for territorial swaps, and evacuate others. A token number of refugees would be allowed to return to Israel and a greater number to Palestine. The idea was once popular, but many have lost faith. Even before October 7th, only a third or so of Palestinians and Israeli Jews supported a two-state solution, down from almost half just five years ago (see chart). “Every failed process has a price tag,” says Nimrod Novik, who was a foreign-policy adviser to Shimon Peres, an Israeli politician. “It reinforces the erroneous conclusion that it cannot be done.” Since October 7th support for peace negotiations of any kind has plunged in Israel. Despite the disillusionment, there is no clear alternative. Polls show both Israelis and Palestinians divided about how to end the conflict. Some hope for a “one-state solution” that would see them live in a single country with equal rights. Others support apartheid or ethnic cleansing (they disagree, of course, on who the victims of such an approach should be). These are all non-starters. The events of October 7th blew up the status quo. Expulsion or discrimination are abhorrent. A one-state solution might sound reasonable, but it is practically unworkable: most Israelis and Palestinians reject the idea. That leaves two states. The hitch is that this solution requires big sacrifices from both sides. Israelis would have to give up land, while Palestinians would have to give up on much of the land they have lost since 1948. Leaders on both sides would need to sell these concessions to a sceptical public. But neither side has such leaders. Israel has Binyamin Netanyahu, who has spent his entire career trying to prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state. In a sop to Mr Obama, he did endorse a two-state solution in a speech in 2009 at Bar-Ilan University—though six years later he declared that the Middle East had changed and his speech was “irrelevant”. His Likud party has adopted resolutions opposing Palestinian statehood. Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, reported in November that Mr Netanyahu met backbenchers from Likud to plead for his political survival. “I am the only one who can prevent a Palestinian state in Gaza and Judea and Samaria after the war,” he said, using the Hebrew name for the West Bank. But Mr Netanyahu’s days are numbered. Most Israelis want him gone—fully 76% according to a poll published in November. Surveys suggest that, if an election were held, his Likud party would lose around half of the 32 seats it now holds in the 120-member Knesset. The frontrunner to succeed Mr Netanyahu is Benny Gantz, a former army chief who reluctantly joined Mr Netanyahu’s war cabinet in October. His centre-right National Unity party has opened a wide lead in the polls. He is becoming a rarity in Israel’s fractious politics: a unifying figure. Some of this is down to his vague position on the two-state solution. He has said little about it in public. His party’s official position is a woolly call for “separation from the Palestinians”, without any detail on how this might be achieved. Sources close to Mr Gantz say he has no interest in being more specific. To do so, they say, would play into the hands of Mr Netanyahu. Palestinian statehood is a wedge issue, and therefore Mr Gantz will try to avoid it in the interest of wooing voters away from the prime minister. “In Benny’s conversations with the Americans he says that we should stop using old words for new situations,” says an aide. In other words, he is open to discussing a form of the two-state solution but is wary of using the discredited term. In surveys carried out by his party, most Israelis are in favour of a two-state solution when it is described in other terms, such as “two separate entities”. If Mr Gantz were to pursue some variation on the two-state solution, he would face political obstacles. His party includes hawkish lawmakers who would oppose such a push. “Gantz has some very, very right-wing people in there,” says Dan Ben-David of the Shoresh Institute, an Israeli think-tank. The same goes for some of his prospective coalition partners—and the Israeli public, which has swung to the right over the past few decades. Palestinian politics look even more forbidding. A peace process is unthinkable with Hamas, which has spent three decades playing spoiler. It started a campaign of suicide-bombings to sabotage the Oslo accords, and then soured a generation of Israelis on the idea of peace with continued attacks during the Palestinians’ second intifada, or uprising. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, supports a two-state solution, as does his nationalist Fatah party. But he is 88 years old and will soon start the 20th year of what should have been a four-year term. Few Palestinians (or Israelis, for that matter) think he has the legitimacy or acumen to lead a serious push for peace. “He’s in a delusional bubble, surrounded by three or four very powerful yes-men,” says an Israeli officer, an assessment shared by many of Mr Abbas’s former associates. The White House has mused about Salam Fayyad, a technocratic ex-prime minister and former IMF official, coming back to his old job. Even Arab officials now say in private that they want a change in Palestinian leadership. The Saudis are pushing for Hussein al-Sheikh, Mr Abbas’s right-hand man, to succeed the president. The UAE hopes to see a role for Muhammad Dahlan, a former Fatah security chief who has spent the past decade in exile in Abu Dhabi. They would all be acceptable to Israel—but perhaps not to Palestinians. Polls put their popularity in the single digits. Another option is Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah leader serving five life sentences in Israel for orchestrating attacks on Israeli civilians. (He refused to present a defence, denouncing the trial as illegitimate.) Some hope he could become a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, emerging from prison to unite a fractured movement and negotiate with Israel. He often polls as the most popular Palestinian leader—but that is mostly because he has spent decades out of the public eye, at a time when Fatah descended into corruption and senescence. Even if Israel allowed him out, it is unclear how capable a leader he would be. American and Arab officials have pushed for Palestinian elections. At least in the West Bank, though, that could lead to victory for whatever remains of Hamas, seen by Palestinians as the only party willing to stand up to Israel. For Fatah to regain popularity, it would need to do two things. One is to curb its members’ rampant graft (asked to name the most pressing problem for the PA to tackle, more Palestinians mention corruption than occupation). The other is to show that a non-violent approach can yield results. “They have to make Hamas ineffective,” says Khalil Sayegh, a Palestinian academic from Gaza. “People have to see that Hamas is not really doing anything good.” That requires concessions from Israel, which points to a second question: how to make negotiations credible. After decades of failure, both Israelis and Palestinians would be sceptical. For Israelis, though, those decades were nonetheless good ones: they coincided with an economic boom, a long stretch of relative peace and burgeoning relations with Arab states. For Palestinians, they brought only deepening despair. “The whole project of an independent Palestinian state is becoming part of the past,” says Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian minister. The onus would be on Israel to dispel that perception. Mr Novik is part of Commanders for Israel’s Security, a group of retired security officials who advocate a two-state solution. He offers a “menu” of steps Israel could take to show renewed commitment. It could shrink Area C, the two-thirds of the West Bank under full Israeli control, and expand Area B, where the PA has authority over civil matters, but not security. (Area A, where the PA has full control, is even smaller: see map.) It could stop demolishing unlicensed homes in Area C, where it refuses to grant Palestinians construction permits (it usually issues ten or fewer each year). It could curtail army raids in Palestinian cities. For Palestinians, though, these steps would be woefully insufficient. A slightly expanded Area B would hardly be a resounding achievement that Fatah could sell to a dubious public. “We’ve waited 30 years for a state,” says a diplomat. “We don’t want some construction permits.” The Oslo accords, after all, were undone by gradualism: the idea that both sides needed to build trust with symbolic moves before agreeing on more substantive steps. Asked what would constitute a more serious gesture, several Palestinian analysts point to the settlements in the occupied West Bank, home to around 465,000 Israelis. It would not be enough to freeze new construction, they say; that has been tried before, including under Mr Obama. Israel should go further and dismantle some of the settlements it would have to relinquish in a peace deal. That would both build confidence and advance a final-status agreement. It also seems politically impossible in Israel, especially after October 7th, since it would be seen as rewarding a massacre. After decades of foot-dragging, Israel is unlikely to make any big gestures without pressure from America. “Unless the Israeli system actually feels there’s a cost for going in this direction, I don’t see how you free up some space for different politics,” says Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator. An Arab diplomat suggests this pressure, too, should initially be aimed at settlers: “America needs to get rough.” On December 6th America announced that it would impose visa bans on violent settlers who attack Palestinians and their property. That is an unprecedented step—but it, too, is symbolic. Settlers motivated by ideology are unlikely to be dissuaded by a visa ban. Anyway, some of them cannot be banned: they are American citizens. For an American squeeze on settlements to succeed, it would need to encompass the Israeli state, too. International law obliges the Israeli army to protect Palestinians in occupied territory, but it often stands by as settlers carry out attacks. If it continues to allow (and sometimes abet) such violence, America could threaten to cut military aid. That would be a clear signal, to the Palestinians and the Arab world, that America was serious about trying to play a less biased role. But such a threat is hard to imagine in an election year—or if Donald Trump wins the presidency in 2024. If Mr Biden secures a second term, though, such a move would be popular with the progressive wing of his party. Along with threats, America and its partners would also have to offer incentives. For the Palestinians, these would probably be mainly financial. The most immediate question is how to rebuild a shattered Gaza, the bill for which will easily run into tens of billions of dollars. Wealthy Gulf states would be willing to contribute—but only if Gaza becomes part of a Palestinian state and their investments are unlikely to be blown up again. At the same time, the Gulf states could help assuage Israel’s security concerns. When the Oslo process began, only one Arab state, Egypt, had diplomatic ties with Israel. Today six of them do, and Saudi Arabia appears willing to join the club. The prospect of normal relations with the Arab world seems real in a way it never did in decades past. Ending conflict not only with the Palestinians but also with the entire region should be a powerful inducement. At a meeting in Qatar earlier this month, the Gulf states talked about a plan for post-war Gaza. They resolved to work with Jordan, Egypt and Western powers to form an international coalition to push for a two-state solution. Arab states would demand that the PA choose new leaders, while America would press Israel. But even if the Gulf states recognise Israel, Iranian-backed militant groups that have weighed in on Hamas’s side, such as Hizbullah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen, would not do the same. “We would have to get Iran on board,” says a diplomat from the Gulf. Asked if that was realistic, he demurred. Hostility toward Israel has been a core tenet of the Islamic Republic’s ideology for decades. The creation of a rump Palestinian state may not turn them into Zionists overnight. The risk, then, is that history repeats itself again. A new crop of leaders might pay lip service to a two-state solution. Israel might soften its hostility toward the PA and offer a few concessions. Gulf states would pledge money and recognition. But the deal on offer would be, fundamentally, the same as before—a deal that a far more optimistic generation of Israelis and Palestinians rejected. In recent years intellectuals on both sides have begun calling for more creative thinking. One idea is of a confederation in which there would be both a Jewish and a Palestinian entity. Citizens of one part would be entitled to live and work in the other. The idea is to diminish the importance of exactly how such a small parcel of land is carved up and to give each side greater interest in the stability of the other. There are even more obstacles to this idea than to the standard two-state blueprint, but there is a virtue in novel concepts. “Israel benefits from the unseriousness of an international approach which simply says, go back to two-state negotiations,” says Mr Levy. Those negotiations too often become an end rather than a means, even though by now there is little left to negotiate: it has all been discussed ad infinitum. The events of the past few months show the status quo is untenable. Change is inevitable. The only question is what form it will take. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/settlers-are-causing-mayhem-in-the-west-bank,"VIOLENCE PERPETRATED by Jewish settlers in the Palestinians’ West Bank has risen sharply since October 7th. The Israeli army and the settlers have, in total, killed at least 155 Palestinians in the territory, the core of a would-be Palestinian state, since Hamas committed its atrocities against Israel. This death toll is a fraction of the number killed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in the same period. But it is rising dangerously fast. The occupied West Bank is getting closer to boiling over. Last year was already the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank for 20 years. Settler groups have become bolder and the army has intensified its raids on Palestinian towns and cities. But since October 7th things have dramatically worsened. At the current rate, the four weeks following the Hamas attack will have been more deadly for Palestinians in the West Bank than the whole of last year. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas In particular, the war in Gaza has aroused some of the more violent groups of West Bank settlers. Some are out for revenge for Hamas’s atrocities. Others are simply taking advantage of the situation to lash out while Israel’s army is busy elsewhere—in Gaza and on the northern front with Lebanon. As a result, the West Bank’s Palestinians are feeling even more vulnerable than usual. In Qusra, a village south-east of the city of Nablus, four Palestinians were killed by settlers on October 11th. The next day, during a funeral procession for them, two more were shot dead by settlers, according to Hani Awda Abu Alaa, the town’s mayor. “[The army] assured us over the phone that the new route was secure,” he said. “But they set a trap for us…We encountered a large number of settlers who attacked us with stones and bullets.” The mayor accused Israeli soldiers of “protecting the settlers”. What has changed in the past few weeks is that elements of the army and those settlers who are bent on violence appear to have teamed up, according to Yonatan Kanonich of Yesh Din, an Israeli watchdog that monitors Jewish settlements in the West Bank. “People sometimes wear army trousers or shirts, they have weapons,” he explains. “You don’t understand if it’s a settler or a soldier, you can’t really tell. It’s all the same now,” he says. “If the soldiers stood back idly before, and didn’t do anything, now they are joining the settlers in their attacks.” Some 500,000 Israelis live in settlements (excluding East Jerusalem) in the West Bank regarded as illegal by the UN and foreign governments. They are often cited as an obstacle in peace talks and plainly undermine the territorial integrity of a future Palestinian state. The building of settlements has steadily increased since the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords signed in Oslo in 1993. Since October 7th President Joe Biden has urged Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to rein in the settlers—in vain. Extreme right-wing settlers who hold key posts in Mr Netanyahu’s cabinet seem to have no wish to calm things down. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national-security minister, grinned as he handed out rifles to Israelis to protect “settlements and the cities”. Mr Netanyahu’s current government has delighted the settlers by earmarking large sums for settler roads (from which Palestinians are generally barred) and by giving Bezalel Smotrich, an ultra-nationalist settler who is the finance minister, extra power over planning regulations in the West Bank, though the last word on this still lies with Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister. On the ground, settlers are rarely punished for initiating the violence. In June they rampaged through Turmus Ayya, a Palestinian town, setting fire to homes and cars. One Israeli officer branded the settler attacks “nationalist terrorism”. But no serious consequences followed. Once labelled as rogue operators, violent settlers now have representation in Israel’s coalition government. For years some Palestinian officials and foreign observers have been warning of a third intifada, or uprising—and now fear it is likely to break out. “It has already exploded,” says Tawfiq Tirawi, a former Palestinian security chief with strong ties to the West Bank’s refugee camps who fell out with Mr Abbas. “The people are brimming with anger and a revolutionary spirit,” he says. So far unrest has been mainly limited to protests in Palestinian cities. The Israeli security forces, sometimes aided by the Palestinian authorities, have arrested thousands to keep a lid on things. Israeli checkpoints have been sharply curbing Palestinian movement. Some Palestinian campaigners say the Israeli government, with the help of settlers, wants to depopulate the West Bank of its Palestinians. Near the big city of Hebron, 13 Palestinian villages, they claim, have been thinned out as a result of threats of settler violence. “It’s clear they are planning and organising…you are talking about an organised militia,” says Shawan Jabarin, a veteran human-rights activist in Ramallah, the Palestinians’ administrative headquarters. He says many Palestinians see the violence as part of a plan eventually to push them out of the West Bank altogether. “It’s about revenge,” adds Mr Kanonich. When Hamas burst out of Gaza to murder Israeli communities across the border on October 7th, most of the Israeli soldiers stationed in the West Bank were regulars or conscripts. But in the next few days, as around 360,000 reservists were called up, most of the regular troops were deployed either to take part in a ground offensive into Gaza or to the northern border with Lebanon in case of war breaking out with Hizbullah, the Shia Muslim militia. Many Israeli reservists and a number of senior commanders are deeply hostile to the settlers and would like them to be restrained. But they fear that other groups of reservists left behind on the West Bank may be unable or unwilling to do this. Israel’s army and border police have rarely arrested settlers for violence, though one ringleader has been put into administrative detention without being formally charged. The Palestinian Authority, which is supposed to administer chunks of the West Bank, is largely powerless to protect Palestinian civilians. Its senior officials are strongly against the prospect of another intifada, fearing that that would give Hamas an opportunity to become the dominant Palestinian force in the West Bank. In any case, much of the violence takes place in areas where the Palestinian security forces have no freedom of movement or jurisdiction. Palestinians reckon it is unthinkable that they would arrest or directly confront a settler. One veteran Palestinian security official says he fears that a single incident may spark an intifada. “I smell blood in the West Bank,” he says. “I don’t know where it will be, but it is coming: the settlers are going to do something terrible.” ■ Correction (December 4th, 2023): The original version of this article mistakenly stated that America does not consider Israel’s settlements in the West Bank to be illegal per se. Under Donald Trump, the American government reversed its decades-long position on this question. Joe Biden’s administration has not overturned that decision. The story has been corrected. Sorry."
