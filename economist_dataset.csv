https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/06/israel-is-pushing-into-southern-gaza-as-the-clock-ticks-down,"WITH THE war in Gaza about to enter its third month, Israeli forces are pushing hard into the crowded southern half of the coastal strip. In the most intense fighting seen so far, they are hoping to inflict as much damage as they can to Hamas’s remaining strongholds before the political clock runs out on what may be Israel’s last large-scale ground offensive of the war. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas On December 5th Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, the chief of staff of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), said his troops had encircled Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza and the birthplace of Hamas’s two main leaders in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar and Muhammad Deif. They have since entered the city itself which, along with two other Hamas strongholds in northern Gaza, Shujaiya and Jabalia in Gaza city, have been the main focus of the IDF since the collapse of a weeklong truce on December 1st. Israel’s aim is to destroy Hamas’s military capability and its ability to govern Gaza. So far it has succeeded only partially, at a terrible price to Gaza’s civilians: the Hamas-run authorities say more than 16,000 have been killed. Israel, which says the tally includes militants and several senior field commanders, has forced Hamas from its main hubs in Gaza city, large chunks of which have been destroyed. A similar fate now awaits Khan Younis. But the movement’s top leaders are hunkering down in an extensive tunnel network, along with thousands of fighters. The IDF says it has found more than 800 tunnel entrances in northern Gaza and has blown up most of them. But many of the deeper tunnels are believed to have remained intact, so Israel is considering more drastic measures, such as flooding them with seawater. Hamas, meanwhile, has retained the ability to launch rockets against Israeli cities as distant as Tel Aviv, more than 70km away. Though the salvoes are smaller than in the earlier stages of the war, the fact that they are continuing after months of intense Israeli attacks shows how difficult it will be for the idf to destroy Hamas as a military threat. In any case, Israel may be running out of time. In public Israel’s leaders insist that there is no time limit on the operation. Yet in private, senior officials acknowledge that the push into Khan Younis may well be the last major manoeuvre of the war and a prelude to the next stage, when the IDF will carry out smaller, briefer raids. International support—and what Israel calls its “window of legitimacy” to conduct intensive warfare—is eroding in the face of the bloody toll in civilian lives in Gaza. Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, has made clear to Israel’s war cabinet that the idf will not have the “months” they say it needs to finish the job. Mr Blinken also said that the administration is watching closely to see whether Israel is making greater efforts to minimise civilian casualties than earlier in the war. America also wants Israel to let more aid reach the 2m or more Palestinians who are now crowded into southern Gaza. Whether Israel appears to be meeting these conditions will determine how long America will keep backing its offensive. Israeli officers say they have tried to minimise hitting civilians when fighting an enemy that hides among them. They say that Hamas fighters account for about 5,000—or roughly one-third—of the total deaths reported, giving a rough ratio of two civilians killed for every combatant. But this arithmetic is not winning over its American ally. Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, said on December 2nd that his lesson from commanding forces against Islamic State in Iraq was that “you can only win in urban warfare by protecting civilians” and that “if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.” In an attempt to lower the rate of civilian casualties, the IDF is trying to micromanage the movements of Gaza’s inhabitants. In the first stage of the war it simply ordered them to vacate northern Gaza, forcing some 1.2m out of Gaza city and its surrounding towns. It has since issued a map that divides Gaza into a jigsaw puzzle of 623 sections. It sends out text messages and air-drops leaflets telling people which ones to leave and which are safe. Relief organisations say this is unrealistic and ineffective amid the chaos of Gaza. In order to move to safety, the shell-shocked population is inevitably finding it hard to escape Israel’s bombardment or Hamas’s attempts to fight back. Even if civilians do follow Israeli guidelines, they will have to crowd into a shrinking area alongside the thousands of Hamas fighters who will doubtless follow them. Moreover, Israel has yet to present a comprehensive humanitarian plan for these supposedly safe areas. During the truce, Israel agreed to allow in 200-300 aid lorries a day, though on average only 170 crossed the border from Egypt and the number has since fallen to around 100 a day. Binyamin Netanyahu’s government faces other pressures, too. For the sake of Israel’s economy he must start scaling down the war and let many of the 360,000 reserve soldiers go back to work. Yet some parts of Mr Netanyahu’s far-right coalition have threatened to peel away from his government if he winds down the ground campaign too soon.  Meanwhile the families of the 138 hostages still held in Gaza (some of whom Israel reckons are dead) are clamouring for another agreement with Hamas to get them back. During the truce Hamas freed 110 hostages (mainly women and children), including 24 foreign workers. But the deal brokered by Qatar collapsed when Hamas refused to release the remaining 17 women and children it still holds. Israel insists they must be returned before it will begin talks about the male hostages. Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, has tried to assure the families that “when the military operations advance, the pressure on Hamas rises and so do our chances of returning more hostages”. Meanwhile, the captives remain in grave jeopardy. Some were wounded on October 7th and need treatment. In a tense meeting with their families on December 5th, Mr Netanyahu was accused by one relative of “putting politics above returning the hostages”. The IDF is acutely aware that it is operating under a mix of irreconcilable expectations. Israel’s politicians and most of its people want it to destroy Hamas; the hostages’ families above all want their loved ones home; and Israel’s international allies want fewer Palestinian casualties and an end to this war. If America calls more loudly for a quicker end to the fighting, the pressure will inevitably grow. Meanwhile Hizbullah, a Shia Islamist militia in Lebanon, is again launching missiles and drones towards northern Israel as intensively as it did before the truce. And Houthi rebels in Yemen are busily attacking ships in the Red Sea (see next article). Israel’s embattled prime minister, whose popularity is plummeting and whose rivals in the war cabinet are eyeing his job, is seeking desperately to avoid making hard choices between those irreconcilable aims. As the tanks rumble into southern Gaza, crunch time looms. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/07/israel-and-palestine-how-peace-is-possible,"IF YOU WANT to understand how desperately Israelis and Palestinians need peace, consider what would become of them in a state of perpetual war. Against a vastly superior Israeli army, the Palestinians’ most powerful weapon would remain the death and suffering of their own people. Israel’s fate would be woeful, too, if it wants to be a flourishing, modern democracy. If Israel permanently relies on its army to subjugate the Palestinians, it would become an apartheid-enforcing pariah. Israelis carrying out daily acts of oppression punctuated by rounds of killing would themselves be corrupted. For two peoples locked in a violent embrace, peace is the only deliverance. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas But how to get there? Israelis are still reeling from the rape and murder of October 7th; Palestinians are watching the mangled bodies of women and children pile up in Gaza. Amid the carnage, outsiders’ urging of peace seems naive. Besides, jaded Palestinians and Israelis see endless talks as a mechanism for delaying peace, not forging it. Negotiators in the past have thrashed out almost every imaginable permutation of land swaps and security arrangements. All failed. And yet something changed after October 7th. Israel’s strategy of marginalising the Palestinians and their dreams is broken. Both sides have a chance to find new leaders with a new vision. And after years of neglect, outsiders may be ready to help, crucially including a group of Arab countries. They must not fall into the trap of thinking that peace requires sweating the detail yet again. Success depends on the two sides wanting peace and—much harder—believing in it. If the fighting is to make any sense it must lead to peace, which means two nations living side by side. Israel’s bombardment has killed over 16,000 Palestinians, including Hamas fighters. Although some Palestinians have been radicalised by that and the daily humiliations of occupation, many detest Hamas and its unwinnable wars and would live with Israel if they could prosper. So long as the men with guns do not get in their way, those people will seek peace. Israel, too, needs a new strategy. The old one failed to fulfil the state’s basic promise to create a land safe for Jews; 1,400 people were killed or kidnapped by Hamas, hundreds of thousands more have been evacuated. Peace also requires new leaders, because the present ones are discredited. In Israel Binyamin Netanyahu is an obstacle to a genuine reconciliation, the sooner he goes the better. America could usefully signal that it expects Israel to hold elections soon. Polls suggest that he will be replaced by Benny Gantz, a former general who understands the toll of war. Mr Gantz has not endorsed a Palestinian state, but neither has he ruled one out. New Palestinian leadership is needed, too. Hamas is an avowed enemy of peace: for as long as it runs Gaza, Palestinian pledges to embrace peace will not be believable. On the West Bank, Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian Authority (PA), is corrupt, ossified and lacks any democratic legitimacy. Amid the rubble of war, Gaza will need time to rebuild and re-establish some kind of stable administration. Moderate Arab countries should sponsor a transitional Palestinian leadership for the West Bank and Gaza that can begin building trust among its own people and, vitally, with the Israelis, before holding elections. By running both Gaza and the West Bank, it would become a more credible partner for peace. That leads to the process. The Oslo accords, marked in 1993 with a wary handshake on the White House lawn, left the hardest details until last. Every inch of progress had to be wrung out of the two sides. This sapped belief that success was possible. A new process must make early progress. Both sides will have to take on their own extremists, who would sabotage coexistence. The PA must shut down armed groups, foil terrorists and tackle corruption. Boosting the economy demands numerous agreements with Israel over trade, utilities and work permits. Palestinians need to know they are gaining freedoms and rights. Land swaps can wait, but Israel should deal with the settlements too deep in the West Bank ever to be part of Israel. It must start policing them and stop them from expanding further. It needs to be clear that the 100,000 or so settlers who live in them will eventually have to move or come under Palestinian rule. This is too hard for the Israelis and Palestinians to do on their own, so the outside world must be involved. Under Oslo, America was the sponsor, but it struggled to exert pressure on Israel, which can muster formidable support in Congress. This time, the Arab world should play a decisive role. Under the Abraham accords, negotiated during the Trump administration, several countries recognised Israel. That was part of a vision for the Middle East based around trade and prosperity rather than ideology. Their money will be required to rebuild Gaza. Their soldiers can help provide security when Israel leaves the strip, which should happen as early as possible. If they work together, they can starve Hamas of money and shelter, diverting funds to reconstruction instead. Their heft can give a transitional Palestinian leader diplomatic cover while he establishes himself and his administration. The key is early pressure exerted by America and Saudi Arabia on Israel and the Palestinians. The PA argues that peace could be kick-started if America and the European Union sent Israel a signal by recognising a Palestinian state upfront—an idea endorsed by Spain, which holds the EU presidency. America should fulfil its promise to open a diplomatic mission for the Palestinians in Jerusalem. But full recognition of Palestine by the West and of Israel by Saudi Arabia should be held out as rewards for the future, as an incentive for progress. Time for that is short. Israel’s anti-Palestinian right will remain strong. Once this government falls, the next may have only a single term to rekindle Israelis’ faith that peace is possible. In the PA a new leader will face enemies who got fat under today’s rotten system. Whatever remains of Hamas will seek to wreck peace, as will Iran and its proxies, who thrive on chaos and strife. The Biden administration may be willing to press Israel; a Trump administration might not. If permanent war is not to ruin two nations, Israelis, Palestinians and all who cherish them must seize the moment. ■ For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/03/israel-is-now-fighting-hamas-and-the-clock,"ON DECEMBER 1st Israel embarked on what could be the most crucial stage in its war in Gaza. Its week-long truce with Hamas collapsed early that morning and its forces began to converge on the Islamist movement’s main remaining strongholds throughout the coastal strip. The tactics will be different in this phase but to many watching the mounting Palestinian death toll, that will be of little relevance. Israel is acutely aware that time and support for its offensive in Gaza are running out—and that it has an impossible set of aims to achieve before that happens. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas In the northern sector, where Israel was already in control of most of the by-now largely depopulated Gaza city, it launched air-strikes on the Shujaiya neighbourhood and Jabalia refugee camp. Most of Hamas’s remaining fighters in the north are believed to be holed up in those areas. In the south Israel has struck buildings in Khan Younis, the hometown of Yahya Sinwar and Muhammad Deif, Hamas’s most senior leaders in Gaza, where both are now believed to be hiding. On December 3rd Israel Defence Forces (IDF) tanks were spotted on the city’s outskirts as its ground offensive, until now mostly limited to the north, seemed to be expanding. Israel killed over 700 Palestinians in the second day of fighting after the truce ended, the media office of the territory’s Hamas-run government told Al Jazeera. Around 15,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7th. During the truce Israel allowed over 300 trucks carrying aid to enter Gaza each day; it is letting in nowhere near that now, as before the pause in fighting. Israeli officials say that a plan is in the works to greatly expand the provision of aid (so far this has yet to materialise into anything more concrete). In private Israeli security officials admit that their country’s armed forces are rushing to operate before its “window of legitimacy” closes. They know that they cannot rely indefinitely on international support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, prompted by Hamas’s massacre of around 1,200 Israelis and abduction of about 250 more on October 7th. This support, led by America, is rapidly eroding in the face of the bloody toll in civilian lives in Gaza. On a visit to Israel on November 30th Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, made it clear to members of the war cabinet formed by Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, that they would not have the “months” they say they need to finish the job. Mr Blinken also said that the administration was watching closely to see whether Israel was doing more to minimise civilian casualties and to facilitate the flow of aid to the over 2m Palestinians now crowded into southern Gaza. Other members of Joe Biden’s administration have since reiterated this point. Whether Israel appears to be meeting these conditions will determine how long—and how full-throatedly—America continues to provide backing for Israel’s offensive. On the first point Israel published a new map of Gaza, in which the entire strip had been divided into more than 600 separate zones, as soon as the ceasefire ended. It is ostensibly part of its efforts to limit civilian casualties. Since December 1st residents have been informed, through the media, in text messages and via leaflets dropped from aircraft, both of the zones where the IDF intends to operate and of “safe areas” to which they are expected to evacuate. It is unclear how realistic or effective this system can be in the chaos of Gaza, as a shell-shocked population tries to evade Israel’s ongoing bombardment and deal with Hamas’s attempts to retain control of territory. The IDF’s operations are also constrained by the presence of what it believes are 136 hostages still being held in Gaza. During the halt in fighting, 108 hostages, mainly Israeli women and children, as well as 24 foreign workers, all captured on October 7th, were set free. The truce collapsed when Israel insisted that the remaining 17 women and children being held should be released before any negotiations about the fate of the male hostages began. But the tension between Israel’s stated war aims—to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and remove it from power in Gaza and and to rescue the hostages—is becoming ever more acute. In a meeting with the hostages’ families, Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, tried to assure them that “when the military advances, the pressure on Hamas grows and with it the chance of retrieving more hostages.” Far from all are convinced. The IDF is ever more aware that it is operating under a combination of irreconcilable expectations: of Israel’s politicians and its public, who want it to destroy Hamas; of the hostages’ families, who want their loved ones home; and of its international allies who want fewer Palestinian casualties and an eventual end to this war. If America pushes for a quicker end to the fighting the pressure will grow even further. Meanwhile Hizbullah is once again launching missiles and drones towards northern Israel at a similar rate to before the truce. Israel’s embattled prime minister, whose popularity is plummeting and whose job is being eyed by his rivals in the war cabinet, has sought desperately to avoid making hard choices between Israel’s irreconcilable objectives. But as the tanks rumble into southern Gaza, crunch time looms. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/30/does-hamas-want-to-keep-fighting-israel-or-start-talking-peace,"WHEN HAMAS smashed across the Gaza border on October 7th, killing some 1,200 Israelis and abducting around 250 more, it thrust itself into the very centre of international attention. The issue of Palestinian statehood, which had been forgotten as Arab countries established diplomatic relations with Israel under the Abraham accords, is once again seen as the key to stability across the region. Yet it seems increasingly clear that Hamas, which planned its assault down to the smallest detail, failed to anticipate Israel’s military response and had no greater goal for the following days than to barter hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Almost two months into the war it started, does it have a plan? Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas What happens in the coming weeks and months depends mainly on how much deeper and longer Israel’s offensive goes into Gaza and how much of Hamas it is able to destroy. But it also depends on high-stakes struggles within Hamas: between a radical wing in Gaza and more moderate elements in exile in Qatar and Lebanon; between those aligned closely with Iran and its “axis of resistance” and those wanting closer ties with Arab governments; and crucially over whether to implicitly recognise Israel or to keep fighting to exterminate it. Who wins these arguments will affect whether a peace deal based on a Palestinian state alongside Israel can ever materialise. Hamas is by no means a homogenous movement. Its most solid military and political base before the current round of fighting was in Gaza, where it is a government, a military force and a social-welfare body. But most of its top political leadership is in exile in Qatar or Lebanon. It also has a political presence and some armed cells in the West Bank and a footprint among Palestinian refugees scattered across the region. Its activities go well beyond violence—it is a social-service provider, a religious authority, and in the West Bank it discreetly provides benefits such as university scholarships and private hospitals. Knitting this together is a sprawling financial empire that brings in more than $1bn a year to pay for everything from education in Gaza to the rockets it fires at Israel. Iran has provided the group with hundreds of millions of dollars in funds as well as expertise to help build its rocket arsenal. The two faces of Hamas—as a social-welfare movement and as a terrorist group—go back to its formation in 1987 as an armed offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that had previously been involved in charitable projects in the territories Israel captured in 1967. Its initial charter, dripping with anti-Semitic tropes blaming Jews for the French and Russian revolutions, ruled out negotiations and called for the destruction of Israel. By 1993 it was sending suicide-bombers against Israelis. When later that year the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) under Yasser Arafat signed the Oslo accords, recognising Israel and suspending its armed struggle, Hamas set about undermining the deal with a bombing campaign. When Israel withdrew its forces and dismantled Jewish settlements in Gaza in 2005, Hamas proclaimed this as a victory for armed struggle. So, it seems, did many voters who gave Hamas a majority of the seats in parliamentary elections the following year. This appeared to moderate Hamas, at least for a while. It formed a government of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which it had previously rejected as a creation of the Oslo accords, and named Ismail Haniyeh (pictured, top right) the prime minister of Palestine. Yet Israel withheld taxes it collected for the PA and Fatah, the party headed by Mahmoud Abbas, the PA’s president, struggled with it for control of the security forces. In 2007 Hamas seized control of Gaza and set up a separate administration. Israel imposed an even tighter blockade on Gaza, restricting imports and allowing only a trickle of people to cross into or out of the territory. The result has been poverty and misery for the roughly 2.2m people who now live in Gaza. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has regularly erupted. The division of Palestinians into two camps suited Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, who has long obstructed the creation of a Palestinian state. With Hamas in power in Gaza and an enfeebled PA under Fatah in the West Bank, he could argue that Israel had “no partner for peace”. Others in the region played along with this, particularly Egypt under President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, who has viciously repressed the Muslim Brotherhood at home. After Hamas unexpectedly found itself responsible for governing Gaza and shunned by some states in the region, moderate factions within the group began to push for a change in its policies. Khaled Meshal (pictured, top left), previously the head of the group’s political wing in exile, had been trying to align the group with Sunni Arab states in the region and break it away from its alliance with Iran and Syria. In 2012 he moved the Hamas headquarters out of Damascus, Syria’s capital, after President Bashar al-Assad had massacred Sunni rebels and violently repressed the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2017 Mr Meshal pushed through a new Hamas charter, dropping much of the previous one’s anti-Semitic language. Above all, it endorsed a Palestinian state inside the territories Israel conquered in 1967—that is Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank—though it stopped short of recognising Israel. But Mr Meshal was supplanted by a more radical and pro-Iranian camp that emerged largely from Hamas’s military command to assume the group’s political leadership. It espoused a vision of a Palestinian state stretching “from the river to the sea”, says Baraa Nizar Rayan, a writer with close ties to the movement, based in Qatar. Influential in this faction are Yahya Sinwar, its political and military leader in Gaza, and Saleh al-Arouri, Hamas’s representative in Beirut who previously commanded the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing (both pictured bottom right and left respectively). Mr Sinwar had signed up to to the new charter, but became more extreme after it failed to lead to a political settlement with Israel, Hamas people say. The attack on October 7th marked the ascendancy of the extremists. “It has proved that the only language Israel understands is force,” argues Azzam Tamimi, a sympathetic historian. “Peacemaking with Israel gets them nowhere.” Much will depend on what happens next with Israel’s military operation to destroy Hamas and kill its leaders. As The Economist went to press, Israel extended the truce for 24 hours in exchange for the release of more hostages. But Hamas will be able to buy no more than a day or two before it has traded all the children and female civilians it holds hostage. Officials of other governments in the region and experts think Hamas will try to keep on bargaining. It might offer to exchange male hostages (whom it defines as prisoners of war regardless of whether under humanitarian law they are soldiers or non-combatants) for high-profile Palestinian prisoners. It may also propose a long-term ceasefire, or hudna, in which it agrees not to attack Israel from Gaza, perhaps for at least ten years. A full ceasefire now would let Hamas claim victory, which would probably strengthen its hardliners, including Mr Sinwar, and give Hamas greater sway over Palestinian politics in the West Bank. “Any scenario that makes it possible for Hamas with any credibility to claim victory will make it possible for them to take over the Palestinian national movement without having to knock on anyone’s door,” says Salam Fayyad, a former prime minister of the PA. A stronger Hamas, particularly if it is emboldened by its attacks on Israel, would make progress towards a two-state solution impossible for the foreseeable future, given its dedication to violence and Israel’s distrust of it. It is still more likely that Israel will resume its assault on Gaza once the truce is over. Israel reckons it has killed about 4,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza and killed or captured about 1,000 more in Israel. It says it has “seriously hit” about half the group’s regional battalions in Gaza and killed the top Hamas commander in northern Gaza, three other senior commanders and dozens of battalion and company commanders. Israeli officials say that before the truce started on November 24th, Hamas’s ability to command and control its forces in northern Gaza had completely broken down. But it may well have used the lull to rebuild its command structure and some of its rocket-launchers. The moment the truce is over, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) plans to focus on the parts of northern Gaza it hasn’t yet entered, especially the district of Shuja’iyya. It also aims to start limited ground operations in southern Gaza with the intention of cutting off Khan Younis, a major city in the south, possibly also entering Gaza from close to the border with Egypt. Israel will probably keep trying to capture or kill Hamas’s leaders in Gaza, particularly Mr Sinwar, Muhammad Deif, who commands the Qassam Brigades, and Marwan Issa, his deputy, who is seen as a more skilled tactician. Yet many Hamas-watchers insist that it will survive the loss of its top leaders. “Deif and Sinwar have written themselves off,” says a Western spook. “Every day they survive is credit…money in the bank for other people to spend.” Others note that although Israel assassinated a number of Hamas leaders in the 1990s and 2000s, it failed to halt the movement’s growth. Even if it is militarily diminished, Hamas will probably retain much influence in Gaza. It might be nigh-impossible to govern the strip without a measure of its acquiescence. Yet there are also signs that Israel’s ferocious retaliation may be eroding support for Hamas among ordinary Gazans furious at the destruction Mr Sinwar has brought down upon them and their homes. The militant wing aligned with Mr Sinwar may also be weakening. By contrast, Hamas appears to have gained support in the West Bank, through winning the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails as part of the hostage bargain. With Mr Sinwar and many of the group’s military leaders in Gaza hiding in tunnels out of sight of Israel’s drones, Hamas’s leaders in exile, such as Khaled Meshal and its top man, Mr Haniyeh, both of whom advocated the charter’s revision in 2017, are growing in importance, says an Arab diplomat. Husam Badran, a senior Hamas politician in Qatar, acknowledges that “the state of Israel exists”, adding that ”the missing state is Palestine”. In effect, Hamas offers “de facto recognition (of Israel) but not de jure,” says Qusay Hamed, a Palestinian expert on the movement. There is huge demand among Palestinians for a government that again unites Gaza and the West Bank. Several Hamas men have held talks with other Palestinian leaders, including one of Mr Abbas’s ambitious rivals in Fatah, Muhammad Dahlan, whom Hamas chased out of Gaza in 2007. The 88-year-old Mr Abbas is firmly against a reconciliation with Hamas, but he is in the twilight of his rule. If much is left of Hamas after the war, its “resistance” may grant it greater legitimacy among Palestinians than other parties such as Fatah. For that to mean something, it would have to stop being a spoiler of peace. It is not yet clear, perhaps even to Hamas itself, whether it is ready to take that step, and if it does whether it would be accepted by Israel. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/07/israel-is-strangling-the-west-banks-economy,"The war in Gaza has ushered in a grim new economic reality in Ramallah, the de facto capital of the West Bank. Supermarkets have hired security guards to fight off shoplifters. Thousands of businesses have closed. One official reckons the current economic crisis is worse than that caused by the covid-19 lockdowns. About 160,000 Palestinians employed in Israel and in Jewish settlements in the West Bank have had their work permits revoked since October 7th. Tens of thousands more worked in Israel illegally. Before the war their salaries pumped some 1.4bn shekels ($370m) a month into the West Bank’s economy. Because it does not control its own borders, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has to rely on Israel to collect import taxes on its behalf, which account for 64% of its total revenue. When the Gaza war broke out, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, refused to transfer any of this money to the PA, though the Israeli cabinet later compromised, saying it would withhold the portion paid by the PA to Gaza. Though Hamas has controlled the strip since 2007, the PA still covers Gaza’s power bill to Israel and pays the salaries of thousands of public workers including those in the health ministry and the official Palestinian security forces, who are paid to stay at home. In response Shoukri Bishara, the PA’s finance minister, furiously rejected the whole amount. Accepting it would, he says, have been a “violation of our social contract” with Palestinians in Gaza. Those two factors have led to an 80% drop in the PA‘s revenues since October 7th, leaving Mr Bishara with a fiscal deficit of $1.5bn (roughly 10% of GDP in the Palestinian territories). In November it was unable to pay public servants their salaries at all, though it did manage to convince the Bank of Palestine to offer some employees loans worth half of their pay. Whereas foreign aid once made up 30% of the PA’s operating budget, it paid for just 0.7% of it this year. But the Palestinian economy still relies heavily on aid. Donors have shifted much of their direct budgetary support to development financing, in part because of frustration at the PA’s rampant corruption. That is one reason why the PA is in a poor position to deal with economic crises. Another is that it cannot get funds from the IMF, because it is not a member-state of the fund. With no central bank it has no lender of last resort to bail out its banks, some of which are starting to sweat after writing off at least $1bn in loans in Gaza. In normal times lending to PA employees is a tidy source of income. Yet unless they are paid their salaries soon, thousands will begin to default on their consumer debts. Adding to the banks’ woes are signs of capital flight, especially by Palestinians with a foot in Jordan or in the Gulf. Mr Bishara has reduced the PA’s borrowing from Palestinian banks and is loth to increase it again because of the risks this could pose to financial stability.  To stave off the PA’s financial collapse Mr Bishara could try to persuade Mr Smotrich to hand over the customs revenues. But there are few signs Israel’s finance minister will have a change of heart, even though America has tried to alert him to the security risks if the PA goes bust. America and the EU are particularly worried about the already meagre salaries of the more than 30,000 members of the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank. Without pay these men with guns will have little incentive to keep turning up for work. Some have already stopped. “We can tell him [Mr Smotrich] his policies are risking the financial collapse of the PA,” says a diplomat in Jerusalem. “But for him that’s a long-coveted dream.” The PA has asked Qatar for $900m to get through the next six months. But so far neither Qatar nor any of the other Gulf states seems prepared to pay Israel’s obligations, says Raja Khalidi, a Palestinian economist. If they did, it might further tempt Israel to deduct the money it is meant to hand over under a protocol of the Oslo accords, the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  A handout might also allow the PA to set aside desperately needed reforms. “Temporary mechanisms often have a terrible way of becoming permanent and ineffective,” says Mr Khalidi. It could also offer a lifeline to a sclerotic and corrupt institution that few Palestinians believe can ever bring about a Palestinian state.  America has been touting the idea of a “revitalised PA” as the only serious alternative to Hamas’s rule in Gaza. Yet if the pressure of the economic war being waged against the PA by Israel’s far-right government is not relieved soon, there may be little left of the PA to run the West Bank, let alone to govern Gaza. ■"
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/04/how-israel-is-using-drones-in-gaza,"THE GAZA STRIP is a risky place for an invading army: its cities provide cover for Hamas fighters, who know the terrain; it is heavily populated, with civilians often in harm’s way; fighting in built-up areas is likely to be at close quarters and consequently bloody. Since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas, some 75 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza (more than 300 other military personnel died in the terrorist attack on October 7th). Israel has used aerial and artillery bombardment to pummel Hamas from a safe distance: more than 15,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. When troops engage, Israeli commanders have other means to reduce the risk to their soldiers, by putting drones on the front lines. What role are drones playing in this war—and what risks do they pose to civilians? Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Drones are becoming an ever more important tool of war. In Ukraine, where they act as scouts and kamikaze bombers, cheap expendable models have become essential for infantry operations by both sides. The challenges in Gaza are different: most of the fighting in Ukraine has been in open terrain, not urban areas. But Israel has long been at the forefront of military-drone use, says Zachary Kallenborn, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington. In 1982, during the first Lebanon war, Israel Defence Forces (IDF) drones drew anti-aircraft-missile fire and located missile sites. By 1989 Israel had developed its first attack drone. In 2017 the Centre for a New American Security, another Washington-based think-tank, estimated that 60% of international exports of military drones over the previous three decades had come from the country. Like Ukraine it has a nimble tech industry, which has helped it to stay at the cutting edge. Now Israel’s home-grown expertise is being put to use in Gaza. Israel and America are both using large high-flying drones to carry out constant surveillance of the strip. But Israel is also deploying smaller drones that can get much closer to the action. (Hamas also used small drones in its initial assault to destroy cameras and attack IDF troops.) The IDF is not releasing details of its operations but Aviv Shapira and Rubi Liani, co-founders of Xtend, an Israeli drone startup, told The Economist that their models are being used in Gaza. One, Xtender, is a small drone designed for indoor and underground operations, making it well suited to buildings and tunnels in places such as Gaza city. The drone has shrouded rotors to prevent damage from contact with walls and its software allows it to recognise objects and avoid collisions. It can attach a charge strong enough to break down a door, back away before it is detonated and then proceed. Xtender can also carry a small explosive warhead, weighing up to 150 grams. Wolverine, a larger drone, can manage over ten times that. It is big enough to carry through-the-wall life-detection radar to check whether a building is occupied, or a gripping claw for picking up objects. These drones are often used to inspect possible explosives, and blow them up from a safe distance or create a diversion with a stun grenade while troops approach. Israel’s drones are advanced, but Gaza presents special difficulties. As Mr Shapira notes, the first thing drones lose in urban combat is GPS, which stops working indoors and in “urban canyons”  where tall buildings block signals from satellites. Drones operating in these conditions use Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping, an alternative system: their cameras build a 3D model of their environment and track their location. Radio links, used for communication, are also weaker indoors and underground; and Hamas is thought to be jamming both GPS and radio signals. One way of overcoming these obstacles is to have drones act as communication relays for other drones; Xtenders can work in a chain to connect an operator with a unit which would otherwise be out of reach. These drones can also operate semi-autonomously, continuing with a mission without human input or returning to a place where they can connect via radio. That they can function autonomously also makes these drones easier for operators to use, enabling them to focus on important updates, such as whether the drone has found people or weapons. Drones are intended to reduce the danger to soldiers, but they also have a devastating impact on civilians. Operators can and do make mistakes and to send explosive-laden drones into buildings where civilians are sheltering brings obvious dangers. And although Xtend is keen to point out that it does not build autonomous “killer robots” able to locate, identify and attack targets on their own, the technology to do just that is now feasible. For better or worse, there is now nowhere drones cannot reach.■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/30/israels-truce-with-hamas-is-drawing-to-a-close,"ALMOST A WEEK after the guns fell silent in Gaza on November 24th, the respite offered to the territory’s 2.2m people and the celebration of Israelis at the return of hostages appeared to be coming to an end. As The Economist went to press on November 30th the truce was on a knife edge. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas About two hours before fighting was due to resume at 7am local time, Hamas said Israel had rejected an offer for it to return seven female and child hostages along with the bodies of three more. Israel had previously said it would only extend the truce by 24 hours for every ten live captives. About an hour before the deadline they reached a deal when Hamas added one more name and Israel agreed to credit it with another two after the release of 12 hostages the day before. The exuberant scenes at the return of hostages and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel were the result of hard-nosed, cold negotiations that took place mainly in Doha, the Qatari capital, in a deal brokered by Hamas’s Qatari patrons. Hamas refuses to disclose whether hostages are alive or dead, save for a nightly list of those to be released the next evening. For every Israeli returned, three Palestinian women and minors, most of them accused of violence or terrorism, would be freed. Talk has since turned to the possibility of more deals for the release of the roughly 160 hostages still held in Gaza. A grand bargain has been aired whereby they could all be set free in return for Israel emptying its jails of thousands of Palestinian prisoners and agreeing to a long-term ceasefire. Israeli officials have been quick to quash these rumours. Their priority is to secure the release of the remaining children and civilian women, but they expect Hamas to demand a far higher price for the freeing of other categories of hostages: elderly men; male civilians of military age who are considered “combatants” by Hamas; and actual soldiers, male and female. They also worry that Hamas will try to drag out negotiations in order to extend the truce without giving anything in return.  The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) reckons that half of Hamas’s 24 battalions have been severely hit, with many of them losing their commanders and headquarters, both above and below the ground. The IDF has captured around 80% of the built-up area in the northern sector of Gaza and says it has found around 800 tunnel-shafts, half of which its forces have already destroyed. Military officials also say the IDF has achieved a key aim of capturing areas that hosted over half of Hamas’s rocket-launchers. This had sharply decreased rocket attacks on Israeli towns before the truce. It is notoriously difficult to count bodies during a war, especially since so many Hamas fighters are underground, but Israeli intelligence reckons that around 5,000 Hamas fighters have been killed so far in Gaza and Israel. Along with those wounded and captured, around a quarter of Hamas’s fighting force may have been eliminated. This is a big blow to Hamas, but not enough to prevent it from returning to power in Gaza once Israel leaves. The group’s leader there, Yahya Sinwar, and his chief military commanders, Muhammad Deif and Marwan Issa, are believed to be holed up in their home town of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. As soon as the truce ends, the IDF will have two immediate priorities: to continue destroying tunnels and Hamas’s structures in the area it already militarily controls; and to enter the remaining Hamas strongholds elsewhere in Gaza. Though Israel expects stiff opposition from Hamas’s remaining fighters, it will have two big advantages in the north. The area it will be attacking is almost entirely empty of civilians, who have fled south. This will allow the IDF to use its massive advantage in firepower, both from the air and its artillery, to help armoured columns smash through Hamas’s defences. Things will be tougher when Israel starts an expected second stage of its ground campaign in southern Gaza. The area is crammed with about 2m people, many of them displaced from the north, meaning Israel will have to be more restrained in its use of firepower and armour. It is already under pressure from its main ally, America, to inflict fewer civilian casualties than it did before the ceasefire, when more than 15,000 people were killed, according to the Hamas-run authorities. Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, was due to meet Israel’s war cabinet on November 30th to repeat this advice and to urge Israel to let more aid into Gaza. He also wants Israel to think about who will control Gaza once the fighting is over. Israeli officers admit that tackling Hamas in the south will be “more challenging” and talk of conducting a “mobile” offensive there. This would probably mean taking on the main southern Hamas strongholds in stages with smaller forces. This might reduce civilian casualties, but it would also prolong the war, further sapping international support for Israel. There is also talk, not in public for now because of the objections of the far-right politicians in Binyamin Netanyahu’s ruling coalition, of Israel facilitating the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Since October 7th Israel has not allowed aid to go through its own territory. Instead, supply convoys have taken a circuitous route through Egypt to an Israeli security checkpoint and then back into Egypt before entering Gaza through the crossing at Rafah. Israel’s security establishment is aware that letting in more aid is another way of increasing legitimacy for the military campaign in foreign eyes. Officials have privately said that they are working on re-opening the Kerem Shalom crossing, where most of Gaza’s imports arrived from Israel before this war. But the trauma still felt keenly by many Israelis after the massacre of October 7th and the stories emerging of hostages being maltreated will not make them keen to aid Gazans. ■"
https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/16/israel-needs-to-resist-irrational-retaliation,"“WE WILL OBLITERATE Hamas. We will triumph. It might take time, but we will end this war stronger than ever.” The words of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, are intended not only to convey resolve, but also to signal that his war in Gaza is different. No longer is Israel aiming to punish and deter Hamas. Now it wants to destroy it altogether. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas That is a tall order. Hamas is at the same time a religious idea, a social movement, a political party, a government and a hybrid militia wedded to terrorism. Whatever happens in Gaza, Hamas remains a powerful political force in the West Bank. In private conversations, Israeli military officials are defining the objective more narrowly: to seize the main urban centre, Gaza City; wipe out Hamas’s top political and military leadership in the territory; and destroy as much of its military capacity as possible. That might take weeks or even months of house-to-house fighting, given the extensive tunnel network beneath Gaza. In Iraq and Syria local forces backed by Western air power and thousands of Western troops spent 277 days in the streets of Mosul, and 90 in Raqqa, fighting the jihadists of Islamic State in 2017. Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister, argues that Israel faces four constraints. Three are about the war: how to fight despite the presence of hostages, how to avoid a two-front war that draws in Lebanon’s Hizbullah militia, and how to manage time given the inevitable erosion of international support as Palestinian suffering grows. A fourth concern is about the day after the fighting: “To whom can we pass the torch?” asks Mr Barak. The last question is a fiendish problem to which Mr Netanyahu offers no answer. Hamas’s onslaught on October 7th shows that Israel’s policy of controlling the territory from the outside, by sealing its perimeter on land and at sea, is perilous. Yet in the past the occupation of Gaza, which is home to more than 2m people, proved too costly to maintain. Under pressure of violence from Hamas and other militias, Israel withdrew the last of its military forces and Jewish settlers from the territory in 2005. Without a workable security and political strategy for the “day after”, any military victory may unravel. “Remember Afghanistan. Remember Iraq. Remember Lebanon,” warned Mr Barak on a recent webinar by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank. He was referring to Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and America’s invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and of Iraq in 2003. All three were provoked by acts of terrorism. All three were marked by great initial military successes. And all three turned into grave political debacles. “The Israelis are in the same state that we Americans were in right after 9/11,” argues Kenneth Pollack of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. “We were so angry and so frightened. All we really focused on was destroying anyone who threatened us, and there wasn’t nearly enough attention paid to what comes next.” What wars on terror wrought America’s “global war on terror” started triumphantly. Just two months after al-Qaeda’s attacks on America in September 2001, American-led forces were in control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. The Taliban government was gone. Al-Qaeda was hounded. Its leader, Osama bin Laden, was tracked to Pakistan and killed in 2011. But the Taliban fought a growing insurgency. Having lost more than 2,400 military personnel, America left in 2021. The Afghan government collapsed almost immediately and the Taliban returned to power. The war in Iraq was inglorious, too, and far bloodier. Once again, American forces quickly took the capital, Baghdad, in April 2003. President George W. Bush strutted on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft-carrier, under the sign: “Mission Accomplished”. In fact, the country was about to slip into civil war. American forces captured Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s dictator, but soon faced bloody insurgencies by both Sunni and Shia militias. American forces withdrew in 2011 but returned in smaller numbers in 2014 to help beat back Islamic State after it captured swathes of Iraq and Syria (see chart). All told, America lost some 4,500 service members, not to mention some 300,000 Iraqis who died, most of them civilians. For Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, an American think-tank, the lessons are clear. Terrorist and insurgent groups, he argues, resort to spectacular violence to provoke an irrational response: “They know that the harm that they can do to the dominant power is limited. They understand that the harm that the dominant power can do to itself is infinitely greater.” Israel’s own history offers similar warnings. In June 1982, during a tense ceasefire in artillery exchanges across Israel’s northern border and amid a series of other attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (plo), the Palestinian umbrella group, gunmen shot and wounded Israel’s ambassador in London. The Israeli government took the attack as a casus belli to invade Lebanon and dismantle the PLO, even though the hit was attributed to its rival, the Abu Nidal group. Israeli forces besieged the PLO in west Beirut, forcing its leader, Yasser Arafat, and thousands of fighters, to sail away into exile. Israel’s Christian ally, Bachir Gemayel, was elected Lebanon’s president. Then it all fell apart. Gemayel was blown up. In sight of Israeli forces, his Phalangist fighters exacted revenge by killing Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps. An Israeli commission of inquiry found that Ariel Sharon, Israel’s defence minister, was indirectly responsible, and he was demoted. Within a year, under pressure from anti-war protests, Menachem Begin, the prime minister, announced his resignation. One effect of the Lebanese imbroglio was that the PLO was replaced by Hizbullah, a more formidable Shia militia, which succeeded in pushing Israel out of Lebanon in 2000. Another impact was on Palestinians within the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Their first intifada, or “shaking off”, a stone-throwing uprising that started in 1987, set the stage for the Oslo accords between Israel and the PLO of 1993. Arafat made a triumphant return to Gaza the following year. Hamas emerged as the main force of violent rejectionism. Copying Hizbullah’s suicide tactics, it did much to destroy the Oslo accords. It forced Israel out of Gaza in 2005 and won the Palestinian legislative elections in 2006. The following year it pushed out the Palestinian Authority (PA), the administration created by the PLO. Bereft of Arafat, who died in 2004; stuck in parcels of autonomous territory in the West Bank; and unable to make progress towards statehood by negotiation, the PA was rapidly discredited as it sank into autocracy and corruption. Deterrence theory Since 2006 Israel’s wars have been based on punishment and deterrence, seeking not to destroy its enemies but to inflict such a heavy price as to dissuade the likes of Hamas and Hizbullah from attacking Israel. Deterrence, though, is hard to measure. In the case of Hizbullah, it has generally held since the last big war in Lebanon in 2006, sparked by a cross-border Hizbullah raid that captured two Israeli soldiers. The fighting led to widespread destruction, notably in Dahieh, a Shia neighbourhood of Beirut. Hizbullah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, later admitted he would not have ordered the raid had he known Israel’s reaction would be so severe. In Gaza, though, periods of calm have been shorter. Israel has engaged in what some call “mowing the grass”, ie, periodically beating down Hamas to weaken it. In response to Hamas rocket fire, Israeli forces have relied mostly on retaliatory bombardment, and the protection of its Iron Dome air-defence system. Ground units have entered Gaza only reluctantly. Deterrence holds until suddenly it doesn’t. Hamas’s bloodlust on October 7th was “perhaps the most cruel action in 100 years of conflict between Israel and Palestinians”, notes Mr Ibish. Yet Israel is falling into Hamas’s “trap” in the ferocity of its retribution. The fighting will turn international sympathy from Israel to the Palestinians, allow Hamas to claim leadership of the Palestinian cause and wreck prospects for rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, contends Mr Ibish. Israel is in no mood for restraint. Forget mowing the grass; it wants extirpation. But such uprooting creates a new problem. “If you are going to eliminate Hamas it’s a political issue, not a military one,” says Lawrence Freedman of King’s College London. “You have to establish something, or else Hamas is going to come back.” The Israelis in Lebanon in 1982, and the Americans in Afghanistan and Iraq after 2001, had allies on the ground and day-after plans of sorts, flawed as they turned out to be. In Gaza today, Israel is acting alone. The PA is weak and cannot be seen to return to Gaza on Israeli tanks. Most Arab governments have little love for Hamas, but little courage to be seen conspiring with Israel against it. “I don’t care what happens next,” says Eitan Shamir, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, an Israeli think-tank. “Whatever it is, it starts with destroying Hamas.” The Allies went to war against the Nazis and only later developed a plan to run post-war Germany, he notes. In his view, America’s and Israel’s misadventures began when they started to meddle in local politics instead of leaving promptly. Moreover, America’s experience has little relevance to Israel, says Mr Shamir. It was involved in expeditionary wars, and could bring troops home: “Israel is completely different. We are fighting for our homes. We have no other choice.” For the many Israelis who, like Mr Shamir, think peace is out of reach for the foreseeable future, the only option is to keep hitting foes hard, until they disappear or change. If the current war brings Israel some years of quiet, they say, that is good enough. Israel, though, does not have a free hand. International law and sometimes domestic opinion limit how harsh its response can be. It relies on the West, especially America, to fend off international pressure, but its support is not unlimited. The promise that America “has Israel’s back” risks making it complicit in Israel’s actions, to the detriment of its interests in the region and elsewhere. To take one example: Arab commentators are already drawing comparisons between America’s denunciations of Russia’s atrocities in Ukraine and its forbearance of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. Such concerns explain why Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, has been shuttling across the Middle East seeking to open a humanitarian corridor, allowing vital supplies into Gaza and at least some people out to Egypt. For now, though, Mr Blinken’s thinking about a post-Hamas world is mostly one of platitudes: “a region that comes together, integrated, normalised relations among its countries, people working in common purpose to common benefit.” A solution will not be easy. That is all the more reason to think about it now. Jay Garner, the American general charged with setting the new administration in Iraq in 2003, complained that George Marshall, the American army chief during the second world war, had enjoyed more than two years to plan for post-Hitler Germany, whereas he was being given just a few months to prepare for post-Saddam Iraq. Israel and the world may have even less time to prepare for what comes after Hamas in Gaza. ■ Correction (October 17th): This article was amended to correct the order in which events occurred leading up to Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/18/was-israels-attack-on-al-shifa-hospital-justified,"THE LAWS of war give special protection to hospitals. They lose that protection if they are used for “harmful” acts. Israel has long claimed that al-Shifa hospital, the largest in the Gaza Strip, serves as a key command centre for Hamas, the group which killed or took hostage around 1,400 people in Israel on October 7th. In the early hours of November 15th, after a tense six-day stand-off, members of Shaldag, an elite Israeli air-force commando unit, entered one wing of the hospital. So far there is little evidence of its being a major military facility. Only the coming days will determine whether Israel has in fact rooted out a Hamas headquarters. Whether good evidence turns up matters to both sides. For Israel, the hospital is a prime example of how Hamas hides behind innocent civilians inside targets that are calculated to provoke outrage if they are attacked. For the Palestinians, targeting a hospital is emblematic of how cheaply Israel values Palestinian suffering. If Israel fails to justify its charges against al-Shifa, its operation in Gaza will be undermined. Start with the public claims. On October 27th the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that al-Shifa, which is in the centre of Gaza city, was the “focus” of Hamas’s activity in the Gaza Strip. It said the site had “several underground complexes” used by leaders, including a “control centre” for Hamas’s internal-security unit and a “headquarters” to direct rocket fire, command forces and store weapons. A slick “intelligence-based” video published by the IDF the same day showed a 3D model of the hospital with a Bond-villain lair beneath, including labyrinthine corridors, large meeting rooms and rows of laptops. Israeli officials have said that Hamas had begun creating the facility by 2007, enlarging basements originally dug by Israel when it expanded the hospital in the 1980s. They have also said it had several floors and space for several hundred people. Amnesty International, a human-rights organisation, has said that Hamas had used parts of al-Shifa “to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise ill-treat suspects” in 2014. Hamas’s leadership is thought to have holed up below the hospital during wars in 2009 and 2014. Israeli officials say it has been used to treat the 240 hostages captured on October 7th, some of whom were wounded or had pre-existing conditions. America has endorsed many of these claims. On November 14th John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House, said that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller group, operated a “command-and-control node” from al-Shifa. On November 16th, after the IDF had entered the site, Mr Kirby said America was “still convinced of the soundness of [its] intelligence”. Hamas denies the allegations, and medical personnel at al-Shifa say they have seen no evidence of them. The proof Israel has produced so far has been underwhelming. The IDF says it has found “intelligence materials, military technologies and equipment, command-and-control centres, and communications equipment” at al-Shifa. It has published photographs showing guns, ammunition and Iranian-made anti-tank rockets it says were found in the MRI department, as well as the entrance to an unexplored tunnel shaft. Separately, the IDF has found the bodies of two hostages near the hospital. It has also taken some unidentified bodies back to Israel. It is too early to reach a definitive judgment on whether Israel’s most dramatic claims will eventually be backed by evidence. One reason is that it has so far combed through only a small part of the hospital compound. The IDF is negotiating with medical staff on evacuating the site, which is likely to take several days. Troops are also moving slowly for fear of booby traps. They are under strict orders not to enter tunnels and have used robots and sniffer-dogs to explore them. Israeli officials insist that “there is much more terror infrastructure in the area of the complex that is well hidden.” What’s more, they say, Hamas has had weeks to cover its tracks since it became clear that Israel’s ground offensive would be far larger than in the past. Even if Israel does find evidence, it may not meet the expectations of the watching world. In legal terms, the discovery of a weapons cache could be enough to cause a hospital to lose its protection. However, the Geneva conventions specify that the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from wounded combatants is not enough to qualify. And whatever the letter of the law, finding a clutch of Kalashnikovs and grenades would not be seen by many to justify taking over Gaza’s largest hospital. As a further complication, a command-and-control “node” or “headquarters” is unlikely to resemble the operations room of a conventional army or the IDF video. One tell-tale sign might be communications infrastructure: Hamas is thought to have planned the October 7th attack using hardwired telephone lines, rather than mobile-phone and internet networks monitored by Israel. Israel itself is largely responsible for the high expectations. Many Israeli defence personnel are privately critical of the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit for building up an unrealistic picture of what might be found underneath al-Shifa and exaggerating its centrality to Hamas. Even Israeli intelligence officials do not believe that the group currently has its main headquarters—to the extent that such a thing exists—below the hospital. These, they say, have probably moved to Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza that lies beyond Israel’s current zone of operations. On November 15th the IDF dropped leaflets on the city warning residents of certain neighbourhoods to leave. In practice, Hamas’s command-and-control structure is fluid. The group’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, does not have a single official headquarters or permanent bases. That has presented the IDF with two challenges. One is the intelligence problem of finding commanders. In recent years, the IDF’s military-intelligence branch has attempted to refresh its pre-war “target bank” by using artificial intelligence to analyse data collected from satellites and aerial surveillance. That process is opaque. The other challenge is legal. Under the laws of war, an otherwise-civilian object can become a military one by its “purpose”—if Hamas intends to return to a site in the future, it may be targeted. But the rules for hospitals are tighter. The International Committee of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organisation, says that an army must “interrupt” its attack “if the facility no longer meets the criteria leading to the loss of protected status”—for instance, if combatants have fled. The IDF, which appears to take an expansive view of the rules for hospitals as it does with all targeting, says that after several wars in which Hamas leaders have hunkered down under al-Shifa, Israel intends to clear out the hospital once and for all. ■"
https://www.economist.com/is-israel-acting-within-the-laws-of-war-in-gaza/2023/10/14/,"MORE THAN 1,900 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza since October 7th, when Hamas terrorists murdered 1,300 people in southern Israel. Israeli jets and artillery have been pounding the coastal enclave. “The scenes out of Gaza will be hard to stomach,” warned a spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on October 12th. Hamas, which has deliberately massacred civilians, and whose founding charter commits it to the destruction of Israel, is undoubtedly guilty of war crimes. How far can Israel go in response? Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas Israel’s initial actions have prompted a wave of criticism. B’tselem, an Israeli human-rights group, has accused Israel of “a criminal policy of revenge”, arguing that the scale of its air strikes and blockade constitute “war crimes openly ordered by top Israeli officials”. Médecins Sans Frontières, a humanitarian organisation, has accused Israel of unlawful “collective punishment” of Gaza “in the form of total siege, indiscriminate bombing, and the pending threat of a ground battle.” In practice, though, international law and the specific rules that govern warfare—the law of armed conflict (LOAC), also known as international humanitarian law (IHL)—give Israel considerable latitude to attack Hamas, according to legal experts. Article 51 of the United Nations charter gives states the right of self-defence against armed attack, provided that, according to customary international law, the force they use is necessary and proportionate. Proportionality does not mean symmetry in the type of weapons used or the number of casualties caused. It means that the defending state can use as much force as is needed to address the threat—and no more. Drawing that line is a subjective and contentious process. But Israel’s campaign so far would meet those criteria, argues Aurel Sari, a law professor at the University of Exeter who lectures to NATO armed forces. The scale of Hamas’s attack, its demonstrated intent and proven capability means that invading Gaza or even occupying it temporarily to destroy the group “will be relatively easy to justify” legally, he says. Nonetheless, some measures are particularly contentious. Israel, helped by Egypt, which controls a southern crossing, has maintained a ground, air and naval blockade of Gaza for years, with only some goods and people permitted to cross. Sieges and blockades are not in themselves illegal. But on October 9th Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, said that would turn into a “complete siege”, with “no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed”. Three days later Israel Katz, the energy minister, warned that no “electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter” until Hamas freed hostages. Israeli officials justify this move on the basis that Hamas diverts civilian goods for military use. “Clearly” says Amichai Cohen, a law professor at the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, “there is some level of supply that Israel should allow. The question is whether Israel should provide electricity to areas which are clearly controlled by Hamas, and where Hamas will use the electricity in order to attack Israel.” Others, such as Tom Dannenbaum, a law professor at Tufts University in Boston, argue that Mr Gallant’s order plainly violates a prohibition on starving civilians—even if the goal is to squeeze Hamas. That may be one reason why, despite Mr Gallant’s combative rhetoric, Israeli officials are privately working with Egypt to ensure that some supplies can come in from the south. A second source of legal dispute is the IDF’s decision, late in the evening of October 12th, to tell 1.1m civilians living in the northern part of Gaza to move south. (Hamas called on civilians to ignore the call.) The grave humanitarian consequences of this decision are not in doubt. Gaza’s infrastructure is in ruins and there are few places for so many people to go. But the legal aspects are more complicated. Lawyers distinguish between temporary evacuation of civilians in warzones, which can be lawful, and permanent displacement, where the intent is to prevent them from returning, which is not. However the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a humanitarian group, says that the evacuation instructions, combined with the siege, “are not compatible with international humanitarian law”. It is also not always safe to move while the bombardment continues. Video footage verified by the Washington Post showed a number of people including several children who had been killed, apparently by an Israeli strike while they were fleeing to the south on Friday. The question of evacuation is tangled up with the specific conditions of Gaza, where Hamas is deeply intermingled with the civilian population. IHL, which governs the conduct of armies once they are waging a war, demands that soldiers distinguish between combatants and military objects on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other. Targeting the latter on purpose is always illegal. But an attack that kills civilians—even lots of them—can be legal if it is necessary for some military purpose and proportional “in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”. Israel’s targeting is “broadly within the mainstream of contemporary state practice” and in line with American doctrine, argued Michael Schmitt of the University of Reading and Lieutenant-Colonel John Merriam, a US Army Judge Advocate, in papers published after they visited the IDF’s headquarters and studied its procedures shortly after Operation Protective Edge, Israel’s 50-day war on Hamas in 2014. But the same legal principles, even interpreted in broadly the same way, can result in different and sometimes jarring outcomes because of local circumstances. Hamas’s large rocket force, capable of striking most of Israel, means that the anticipated “military advantage” of attacks is seen to be high, note Mr Schmitt and Lt-Col Merriam. That can justify, in the IDF’s view, high levels of collateral damage that would appear excessive to an army whose civilian population did not face a comparable threat—though, conversely, the effectiveness of the country’s Iron Dome missile-defence system can have the opposite legal effect. Similarly, Israel’s conscript-heavy armed forces are casualty averse and sensitive to soldiers being taken prisoner. That can result in a greater reliance on firepower. Hamas’s way of war also plays a role in Gaza. “It’s not a regular city,” argues Avichai Mandelblit, who served as Israel’s chief military advocate general (MAG) from 2004 to 2011 and attorney-general from 2016 to 2022. “It’s a military city. There are thousands of legal military targets inside the neighbourhoods of Gaza. You cannot distinguish them.” Israel’s war aim is to destroy Hamas. “If you want to do it,” says Mr Mandelblit, “then you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas.” Evacuation of civilians is thus unavoidable, he says. “There is no other way—the other way is they’re going to be killed.” The law nonetheless demands discrimination. Each target must be judged individually. But the scale of Israel’s bombardment—6,000 bombs dropped in six days, compared with 2,000 to 5,000 per month across Iraq and Syria during the American-led air campaign against Islamic State from 2014 to 2019—has given rise to concern that the definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point. “It is very hard to see a legal basis for many of these strikes,” argues Adil Haque of Rutgers Law School in New Jersey. “It’s hard to believe that all of these buildings were in active use by Hamas when they were levelled, or that their military value would outweigh the foreseeable harm to civilians in or near them.” Mr Sari says that the IDF, in his experience, is “world-class” in its legal expertise and professional ethics. “I have a lot of faith in the Israeli military, lawyers and their system. It is very robust.” Military lawyers are present at Israeli military headquarters from the brigade-level up to advise on targeting. “Every target is legally examined,” insists Mr Mandelblit. Legal policy is set by the MAG and civilian attorney general together, with the latter getting the last word. But this system is likely to face its greatest test in the weeks ahead. On October 10th an Israeli official told a television station: “Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents. There will be no buildings.” Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, boasted that “hundreds of tons of bombs” had been dropped on Gaza. Then, he added: “the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy.” Neither statement can be squared with the law. Major acts of terrorism can unmoor even the most professional armed forces. America engaged in torture after 9/11. American, Australian and British special forces have all faced allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. A video published on October 10th appears to show Israeli troops executing Palestinian gunmen who were on their knees and waving a flag of surrender. “If you send tens of thousands of conscript soldiers on a revenge mission into a dense urban area that civilians can’t leave, the results are entirely predictable,” warns Jack McDonald of the Department of War Studies at King’s College London. Restraints that applied in previous military operations may not apply in this war. Mr Mandelblit gives the example of the IDF’s policy of giving prior warning for some strikes. Armies are generally obliged to provide warning of attacks when they can, though not if surprise is essential. “You cannot do it in such a war,” he says. “It’s more like Lebanon now,” he says, alluding to Israel’s war with Hizbullah, the militant group, in 2006. “All we can say to civilians is: look, go away from your cities or your homes, where Hamas is mixed.” The IDF has already abandoned its earlier practice of “roof knocks”—the use of smaller bombs a few minutes ahead of larger strikes—in favour of general warnings to entire neighbourhoods. Israel’s war has acquired an existential quality. “This time it’s going to be a war to the end,” says Mr Mandelblit. “It’s either us or them because we know what they’re going to do to us.” Yet Mr Cohen warns that the law is not the only consideration in waging war. “The fact that a lot of children in Gaza, Palestinian children, will die in an attack—even if it’s legal—is destructive for Israel’s legitimacy around the world.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/23/how-the-gaza-war-affects-israels-minorities-in-different-ways,"About a quarter of the population of the world’s only Jewish state are not Jewish. The different experiences of Israel’s minorities during the war in Gaza highlight the complexities of their position. It was impossible, on November 19th, to drive through the small hillside town of Peki’in in Galilee. Blue-and-white Israeli flags and the multicoloured banners of the Druze flew side-by-side on lamp-posts on the winding street leading to the main square and its statue of a mustachioed Druze warrior. Thousands had come to pay their last respects to Major Jamal Abbas, a 23-year-old paratrooper in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) who was killed in action. In the heartland of Israel’s Druze community, which numbers 150,000, half a dozen military funerals have been held since October 7th. The IDF’s highest-ranking officer killed in the ground campaign inside Gaza was a Druze. Over 80% of Israel’s Druze men enlist, many in combat units. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Other non-Jewish Israelis have been on the front lines too. Hamas is reported to have killed 21 Bedouin Arabs on October 7th, many of them at their places of work on Jewish farms near the border. Six Bedouin are among the 240-odd hostages taken by Hamas into Gaza. In the days after the attack, an alliance of Jewish and Bedouin NGOs jointly set up a hub in Rahat, a mainly Bedouin Israeli city east of Gaza, where volunteers from different communities have been making food packages for families hit by the war. The predicament of the Bedouin hostages held by fellow Muslims in Gaza is delicate. Many Bedouin have relatives there, under Israeli bombardment. Some in Rahat are suspected of sheltering Hamas attackers on the run. Three-quarters of Israel’s 2m Arabs are Muslim Palestinians, and for them the war is especially traumatic and conflicting. Many condemn Hamas but are horrified by the violence in Gaza. “There is widespread revulsion among Arab and Muslim citizens over what Hamas did on October 7th,” says Wurud Jayusi, the head of the Arab Academic Institute at Beit Berl College, north of Tel Aviv. “The murder of civilians, of children, the barbarity of it, is something we can never accept. But at the same time we watch the Arab TV channels showing the terrible destruction in Gaza where many of us have family, something our Jewish friends are less concerned about.” A survey by the Israel Democracy Institute, a think-tank in Jerusalem, reported that the proportion of Arab-Israelis saying that they identify with the state was at its highest ever in the first weeks of the war. Yet as fighting continues, relations may come under strain. In the last outbreak of fighting in Gaza, in 2021, riots erupted in many of Israel’s mixed Jewish-Arab towns. Disturbances have not so far occurred during this one, but that may be because Arab-Israelis are afraid of the current right-wing government. Dr Jayusi says she is “cautiously optimistic” about the prospects for coexistence, but fears a chauvinistic trend among Jewish Israelis in the wake of the Hamas attack and warns against heavy-handed policing of Arab-Israeli dissenters. The Arab Centre for Alternative Planning, an advocacy group based in Eilaboun, a mainly Arab Christian village in Galilee, has so far recorded more than 200 arrests of Israeli Arabs, mainly for alleged “incitement” on social media. The domestic agenda of Israel’s right-wing politicians is also unhelpful. Two laws, passed by previous governments led by Binyamin Netanyahu, the present prime minister, have challenged non-Jews’ official status as citizens. One was a law to stiffen sentences on people who build homes without a permit, a sore point for Israel’s non-Jews, who are often discriminated against in land-allocation and planning permits, among other issues. The other—the Nation State Law—deemed an affront by minorities, states that “the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish People.” At the end of the funeral for Major Abbas, the fallen Druze officer, his grandfather, also a colonel (retired), called for those two laws to be abolished. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/24/america-israel-and-saudi-are-at-the-cusp-of-a-deal,"Muhammad bin salman does little to hide his relish at the prospect of a strategic pact between America, Israel and Saudi Arabia. In a rare television interview on September 20th, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and the country’s de facto ruler acknowledged with a smile that an agreement is on the cards. “Every day we get closer. It seems it’s for the first time real, serious.” A pact would, he said, be “the biggest historical deal since the cold war”. On September 22nd Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, confirmed that the trio of countries were “at the cusp” of a deal. It would, he said, be a “quantum leap”. Four days later Israel’s tourism minister landed in Riyadh for a conference. He arrived to little fanfare, but as the first-ever public visit by an Israeli cabinet minister to the kingdom, it was a historic moment. Formal diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia, the richest and arguably most influential Arab state, and Israel, the Jewish state which the kingdom has long ostracised, have been a long time coming. Since becoming crown prince in 2017, mbs, as Prince Muhammad is known, has held at least one secret meeting with Mr Netanyahu. Both countries have a shared rival in Iran and quietly do business deals. But in 2020 the Abraham accords were signed between Israel and several Arab states, without Saudi Arabia. Few expected Israel-Saudi ties to be formalised during the lifetime of the prince’s father, King Salman, who is of a generation for whom any relationship with Israel was unthinkable. Yet the incentives to do a deal have sharpened. For the Saudis, the motivation is a new strategic alliance with America. The two countries have a security relationship, but the kingdom wants a more formal defence pact, not least because Iran’s intensifying nuclear programme means it is on the threshold of having nuclear weapons, upending the region’s security balance. The talks include the possibility of a Saudi civilian nuclear-energy programme, with a uranium-enrichment facility run by Americans on Saudi soil, according to the Wall Street Journal, rather as Aramco, the Saudi oil giant, was originally American-run. While this effort would be civilian in nature, and America’s unspoken goal is to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, mbs says he reserves the right to pursue nuclear weapons if Iran crosses the threshold. “If they get one, we have to get one…but we don’t want to see that,” he said in his tv interview. For President Joe Biden, a new American-backed diplomatic and defence framework in the Middle East, built around the two regional powers, would be a major foreign-policy achievement with which to enter an election year. During his election campaign several years ago he promised to treat Saudi Arabia as “the pariah that they are” following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist. But today realpolitik rules. His administration sees a deal as a way for America to adapt to a new geopolitical era, in which it remains the ultimate guarantor of the Gulf states’ security even as their economies tilt towards Asia. This would thwart Iran, calm energy markets and prevent China from pulling the Middle East into its sphere of influence. The domestic obstacles remain significant. On the Saudi side, even a near-absolute monarchy must take some account of public opinion. Only 2% of young Saudi Arabians support normalisation of relations with Israel, according to the 2023 Arab Youth Survey, compared with 75% in the United Arab Emirates and 73% in Egypt (both countries have formal ties with the Jewish state). That explains the crown prince’s repeated references in his interview to Israel’s military occupation of the Palestinian territories. “For us, the Palestinian issue is very important. We need to solve that part,” he emphasised. Parallel talks between the Saudis and Palestinians are intensifying. Palestinian officials have been visiting the Saudi capital almost every week in the past few months, according to one source in the West Bank. And on September 26th the Saudis’ first envoy to the Palestinians travelled to the West Bank. In his tv interview the prince did not, however, mention the Arab Peace Initiative, a plan endorsed in 2002 by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states. That envisaged relations with Israel only after an Israeli retreat from all the territories it captured in the 1967 six-day war, including East Jerusalem, and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Instead, the crown prince made vague promises of a deal that would give the Palestinians “their needs” and ensure “a good life” for them. All sides paint a picture of a new Middle East where economic opportunity transcends old hatreds. mbs’s vagueness on Palestinian rights is a recognition of Mr Netanyahu’s domestic travails. Every Israeli leader has yearned to end their country’s regional isolation, which has lasted since its foundation in 1948. For Mr Netanyahu, who is facing widespread protests against the policies of his far-right government as well as corruption charges (which he denies), peace with the Saudis is also a golden opportunity to polish his tarnished legacy. The chaotic first nine months of his latest premiership may explain why the politician who has been so vocal for so many years on the dire dangers of Iran’s burgeoning nuclear programme seems willing to countenance Saudi uranium enrichment. A deal could create shock waves in Israeli politics. Mr Netanyahu’s hardline coalition includes parties which represent the religious Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, who oppose any concessions to the Palestinians. The settlers are well represented within his own Likud party as well. All warn they will oppose any compromise or deal in which Israel has to relinquish control over any territory. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, seems to have realised that the Saudis will no longer wait for a Palestinian state before establishing ties with Israel. But he would like Israel at least to cease building new settlements and guarantee greater Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank. Even that would bring down Mr Netanyahu’s current coalition. “The only formula the coalition will stand for is the Palestinians getting Saudi money for their needs, but no more rights,” says a senior right-wing Israeli politician. If mbs backs even part of the Palestinian demands, Mr Netanyahu will probably lose the support of some of his coalition, and with it his majority in the Knesset. His only option would be to use the prospect of a historic deal to gain the support of the centrist parties, which have hitherto refused to join his government and would demand serious policy changes to do so now. Mr Netanyahu might welcome the opportunity to rejig his coalition, replacing the far-right with centrists. But while the centrist parties led by Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid are in favour of a Saudi deal (though Mr Lapid has expressed serious reservations at the prospect of Saudi nuclear enrichment), both have bitter experience of serving in his previous governments and remain justifiably reluctant to relive that. Even Mr Biden may find the deal hard to sell at home. The prospect of a Saudi nuclear programme will worry Americans wary of regional proliferation. Both progressives in his own Democratic Party, who abhor the Saudis’ human-rights record, and the Republicans, who will fight anything his administration proposes, may obstruct it. His hope is that Mr Netanyahu, who remains popular among Republicans, can sway his opponents. The potential for an American-Saudi-Israeli agreement may be vast, but the political window for securing it is small. “If we don’t achieve it in the next few months,” said Mr Netanhayu, “we might delay it by quite a few years.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/10/how-the-term-genocide-is-misused-in-the-israel-hamas-war,"MANY GOVERNMENTS and citizens are appalled by the civilian casualties from Israel’s bombardment and invasion of Gaza, which is its response to Hamas’s attack on Israel. On October 10th the Palestinian envoy to the UN, Riyad Mansour, described Israel’s actions as “nothing less than genocidal”. Iran and Iraq have also accused Israel of genocide. Politically, it is clear why Israel’s enemies should invoke the heinous crime. But the allegation has also been made by countries that have usually been friendly to Israel. Colombia, Honduras and South Africa have all withdrawn their ambassadors from Israel, accusing its government of committing “genocide”. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Protesters and commentators in the West use the term too. “It is now clear that Israel is engaging in a genocide of the Palestinian people,” argued M. Muhannad Ayyash, a professor of sociology at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Canada. Craig Mokhiber, director of the New York office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, wrote on October 28th that “This is a text-book case of genocide.” Israel has both denied genocide and accused Hamas of the crime. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s permanent representative to the UN, said on October 26th that “This is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation.” What exactly is genocide, and how, if at all, is the term applicable to the current conflict? In December 1948, in the aftermath of the second world war, the UN adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The convention defines a genocide as acts intended “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Contrary to the common understanding of the term, the UN says not only killing counts. “Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction” does too, as does inflicting “serious bodily or mental harm”, “measures intended to prevent births”, and “forcibly transferring children of the group to another group”. Categorising atrocities as genocide has legal implications. The International Criminal Court is able to indict someone for the crime, for example. Interpretations of the convention differ because it is so broadly framed. So which atrocities constitute genocide? The systematic murder of 6m Jews by the Nazis was genocide. The organised butchery of perhaps 500,000 ethnic Tutsis by Hutu militias in Rwanda in 1994 was too. In both cases the intent, to destroy a people, was clear. Yet the case of Darfur, in Sudan, where about 300,000 people died in the years after fighting broke out there in 2003, is less clear. America called this a genocide. But in 2005 a UN commission concluded that Sudan’s government had “not pursued a policy of genocide” (although some individuals may have acted with “genocidal intent”). Donald Trump’s administration called the Chinese government’s treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang a genocide but others disagreed. This newspaper concluded that China’s persecution of the Uyghurs was “horrific”, but not genocidal.By the UN definition, Hamas is a genocidal organisation. Its founding charter, published in 1988, explicitly commits it to obliterating Israel. Article 7 states that “The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them”. Article 13 rejects any compromise, or peace, until Israel is destroyed. Hamas fighters who burst into Israel on October 7th and killed more than 1,400 Israelis (and other nationalities) were carrying out the letter of their genocidal law. Israel, by contrast, does not meet the test of genocide. There is little evidence that Israel, like Hamas, “intends” to destroy an ethnic group—the Palestinians. Israel does want to destroy Hamas, a militant group, and is prepared to kill civilians in doing so. And while some Israeli extremists might want to eradicate the Palestinians, that is not a government policy. Neither do the Israelis display any obvious intent to prevent Palestinian births. But those who accuse it of genocide point to the large number of civilians killed, at least 10,000 so far, and claim its blockade of the strip meets the “conditions-of-life” criterion. The Israelis have clearly inflicted “serious bodily or mental harm” on the Palestinians. They have also displaced people from the north of the strip. If those people are not allowed to return, this could be considered a partial destruction of their territory or, as Jan Egeland, a former UN head of humanitarian and relief efforts, has warned, a forcible population transfer. Even if an army’s actions do not pass the threshold of genocide, they can still be wrong. As the UN concluded during its report into Darfur, “crimes against humanity and war crimes that have been committed…may be no less serious and heinous than genocide”. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/29/how-america-should-manage-the-next-stage-of-the-gaza-war,"Editor’s note: This article was updated on December 1st A SEVEN-DAY TRUCE between Israel and Hamas came to an abrupt end early in the morning of December 1st. During the pause in the fighting as hostages and prisoners were swapped, some things became clear. One is the cynicism of Hamas, which having taken part in the murder, rape or abduction of 1,400 Israelis has engaged in trading infants. Another is the brutal toll Israel has inflicted on Gaza. The north of the strip lies devastated. Some 15,000 people, including terrorists, have been killed according to the Hamas-run authorities, and 2.2m are crowded into the south in dire conditions. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Also visible is the dilemma facing America, Israel’s staunchest ally: for how long should it endorse the war? And how should it try to shape what happens next? These are not abstract questions. As in the past, America has provided Israel with arms and diplomatic cover, and deterred its regional foes. This gives it leverage over Israeli decisions. America’s goals must be to protect Israel’s security and right to self-defence, and to reopen a path to a two-state solution that offers Palestinians self-determination. President Joe Biden should choose the approach that maximises the odds of these goals being reached. That means marginalising the extremists on both sides who want to sabotage a long-term settlement. One option is for America to urge a permanent ceasefire now. That would dramatically cut civilian casualties: were Israel to enter southern Gaza and use the tactics it has in the north, the toll would be far higher because the area is now more densely populated and civilians have nowhere to go. The end of the war might also lead to the fall of Israel’s hard-right coalition government led by Binyamin Netanyahu, which has been and remains an obstacle to a two-state solution. The trouble is a permanent ceasefire now would leave Hamas victorious, undermine Israel’s security and wreck the prospects for two states. Hamas still has perhaps three-quarters of its military strength and says it wants more attacks, cheered on by Iran. Gazans would remain under Hamas’s grim rule. And if Hamas were Gaza’s de facto government, with growing sway in the West Bank, two-states would be impossible, because Hamas would not be seen as a plausible partner for peace. Having used violence to such effect on October 7th, if it were ever to claim that it renounced terror and recognised Israel, it would take years for its word to be believed. That is why America should instead press ahead with its efforts to shape how Israel conducts the war, influence its post-war planning, and steer its politics towards two-states. Mr Biden must be clear that his support for action in southern Gaza is contingent on Israel adopting new tactics, using less armour and bombardment and more infantry, even if that risks more Israeli military casualties. Israel must spell out a realistic military goal: to destroy most of Hamas’s military capabilities and its ability to govern Gaza, rather than eradicating it entirely. Israel needs to go beyond its minimum legal responsibilities and open its border at Kerem Shalom to aid flows, and provide Gazans with shelter and medical help in the enclave and in Israel. Last, America should insist that Israel articulate a long-term plan. In the coming weeks we will explore how a new two-state solution might work. But the ingredients are an interim authority in Gaza, with a role for Israel’s friendly Arab neighbours; a new government in Israel and new, moderate Palestinian leaders; and a resumption of negotiations. As an ardent opponent of two-states, Mr Netanyahu is not credible on the subject. But America can signal its intent by talking to his potential successors and by requiring that he release cash owed to the Palestinians, crack down on violent settlers and restrain the army in the West Bank. If this results in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition falling, so be it. America, rightly, offers Israel extraordinary support in times of need. That gives it extraordinary influence. It should be put to use. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/16/the-rights-and-wrongs-of-israel-and-hamas-at-al-shifa-hospital,"The CRISIS at al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza is a tragedy in its own right and a microcosm of the awful trade-offs created by Hamas’s atrocities and Israel’s invasion of Gaza. Some of Israel’s critics believe that any military activity near or in the hospital is a war crime because civilians may be killed. In fact, because it appears likely that the hospital has been used by Hamas as a military facility, Hamas has probably turned it into a legitimate military target. Still, as a matter of international law, morality and self-interest, Israel must do more to protect civilians. That matters at al-Shifa and beyond it. Even as Israel has won effective control in northern Gaza, the already grave humanitarian crisis is about to explode in the south where over 2m people are at risk as winter looms. Read all of our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Start with the hospital, a set of buildings near the centre of Gaza city. It is surrounded by the Israel Defence Forces (idf) which claims that it made a “precise and targeted” raid on the complex. Around 1,500 people are sheltering in the hospital’s grounds, including babies and critically ill patients. Because fuel and supplies are scarce, conditions are dire. Many innocent lives have been lost. Fighting may kill more civilians if they cannot get treatment or are hit by crossfire. Israel says tunnels beneath the hospital form a Hamas military headquarters. Hamas denies this, but it has a record of deceitfulness. There is also a pattern of violent activity: Amnesty International reported that in 2014 Hamas tortured people within al-Shifa’s grounds. On November 14th America said its intelligence indicates that Hamas uses the hospital and tunnels beneath it as “a command-and-control node”. Using a hospital as a military base, as Hamas may well be, is a war crime. But is attacking the fighters using it as a shield a war crime too? The laws of war establish that once a hospital is used as a military facility it may lose its special protection. Any attacking force must nonetheless take a high degree of precaution, by for example giving adequate notice to evacuate and ensuring evacuation is feasible. In 2016-17 an anti-Islamic State coalition attacked a hospital in Mosul that is used as a stronghold. But the coalition gave a substantial warning period, by the end of which time the hospital was essentially non-functional, and provided trauma centres within 10-15 minutes of the front lines. All this suggests al-Shifa is a legitimate military target for the idf, providing its intelligence is correct. On November 16th Israel said it had found an arms cache in the hospital; soon it will become clear if there is a Hamas tunnel complex, too. Israel says it has sought to evacuate the hospital and supply incubators and fuel to it. But in order for evacuation to be feasible, people need somewhere safe to go. Israel therefore needs to go further by providing more immediate support to the hospital, supplying trauma and other medical facilities nearby and ensuring those who are evacuated have an alternative refuge. This lesson of applying the letter of the law, and going beyond it, applies to Israel’s campaign more broadly. Security for Israel and a better future for Gazans will not happen under Hamas’s rule. The idf has now achieved some of its narrow military goals. It is in effective command of northern Gaza. Yet over 11,000 Gazans have died, according to the Hamas-run authorities. In the south over 2m people face appalling conditions. For Israel’s campaign to be legitimate and even partially succeed, two other tests must be met: civilians need a safety net and there must be a resumption of the peace process. A crucial step is to open its border point at Kerem Shalom to let in aid and fuel deliveries. Israel should also create emergency medical facilities, take patients to Israeli hospitals, and be prepared to set up temporary refugee camps in Israeli territory in the Negev desert. Israel is entitled to go to war with Hamas. But it must do more to rebut the charge that it is going to war against the Palestinian people. ■"
https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/08/israel-hopes-technology-will-help-it-fight-in-hamass-tunnels,"The “Gaza metro” is nothing if not formidable. The network of tunnels built by Hamas beneath the enclave is hundreds of kilometres long. It houses command centres, weapons dumps and stores of food and fuel. It gives Hamas’s fighters the ability to ambush Israeli troops, and to shelter from bombs and artillery. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Israel’s stated goal is to destroy Hamas. Its troops, which entered Gaza on October 27th, are therefore trying to attack and destroy the tunnels. On November 8th Israel said it had destroyed 130 already. But subterranean fighting is notoriously hard and lethal work. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) will be using a variety of technology to help its soldiers with the task. The first job is to find the tunnels. Israel’s network of spies in Gaza has dwindled since it withdrew in 2005, says Michael Milshtein, a reservist IDF colonel. Surveillance drones are one alternative. They can detect “patterns of life” that give clues as to where the entrances are. Imagine, says Robert Cardillo, a former director of America’s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, if 20 people enter a small structure and no one comes out for 24 hours. Satellites are useful, too.  Modern satellite radar can detect surface-height variations on the order of millimetres. That is enough to spot the subtle surface disturbances caused by tunnelling—though Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist who analysed tunnel networks during his time in the IDF, notes that the rubble produced by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza  will have made that sort of analysis harder. Troops can also use ground-penetrating radar, which can detect voids up to 30 metres beneath the surface in ideal conditions. But Gaza’s coastal, saline soils are far from ideal. In practice, detection ranges are limited to a handful of metres. The technology, says Dr Roskin, has proved “unreliable” in the past. Acoustic detection can do better. Amir Avivi, a former deputy commander of the IDF’s Gaza Division, says vibration sensors can detect the digging of a new tunnel, though they are less useful at finding ones that already exist. Those can be spotted instead with ground-based sonar. Like its maritime counterpart, this involves sending out sound waves (often by hammering on a metal plate) and listening for echoes. Pinging the underworld in this way, says Carey Rappaport, a computer scientist at Northeastern University in Massachusetts, can reveal tunnels 100 metres down. Even fancier technologies exist. Buried fibre-optic networks can detect underground vibrations by the “backscatter” they cause in the photons travelling through the cables. Sintela, a British seller of such technology, is mum on the specifics, but its system, branded Onyx, is used on America’s southern border. Tunnels can even be revealed by detecting tiny decreases in gravitational pull caused by their voids. Silicon Microgravity, a British startup, aims to develop, by the end of next year, a gravimeter sensitive enough for the task. Once a tunnel has been discovered, the next step is to disable or destroy it. With relatively shallow tunnels that can be done from the air, using “bunker-buster” bombs that penetrate the ground before detonating. But Hamas’s tactic of digging tunnels beneath civilian infrastructure means that such strikes can kill many civilian bystanders. The IDF, for instance, claims that some of Hamas’s leaders are holed up in a tunnel network beneath the al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s biggest. Egypt, which controls Gaza’s southern border, has in the past flooded smuggling tunnels used by Hamas with sewage. Israel has poured concrete into tunnels during earlier conflicts. But hauling in enough is probably impractical in the present war, reckons one American military official. An Israeli security official says the idf will be making use of “sponge bombs”. These contain chemicals that, when mixed, expand into a dense, hard foam, blocking off the tunnel and buying time for a proper demolition with explosives later on. Sponge bombs are also used in a tactic known as “purple hair”. A smoke grenade is thrown into a tunnel before a sponge bomb seals the entrance. If the trapped smoke wafts out of a nearby building, that suggests it conceals another entrance. Sometimes, though, soldiers will need to enter the tunnels. Drilling rigs can make new entrances to avoid booby-traps set at existing ones. Elbit Systems, an Israeli firm, has developed an armed quadcopter that uses computer vision to fly in enclosed spaces. Other drones can roll through tunnels and climb stairs. Both sides are in for a brutal fight. Hamas will be hoping that its tunnels will help it compensate for the IDF’s overwhelming advantage in firepower. The Israelis, meanwhile, will hope their technology can transform those same tunnels from a refuge into a trap. ■ Curious about the world?

Supporters of the Palestinians have taken not just to the streets but also to their keyboards. “At first I was angry at Hamas and Palestine for the attacks” wrote one user,  “but now after seeing more of what’s going on I cannot support such a regime in Israel. #FreePalestine”. Do such views reflect overall opinion? At our request dmr, an ai-technology firm, collected 1m posts from Instagram, Twitter and YouTube from October 7th to 23rd. All contained hashtags from a list with similar numbers of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian terms in English, or replied to such posts. dmr then built a machine-learning model to classify posts as backing one side, the other or neither. It was trained on content in English, but also processed posts in any language that included English hashtags. dmr found a sharp shift against Israel over time. On October 7th the two sides had roughly equal shares of support. By October 19th pro-Palestinian posts were 3.9 times more common than pro-Israeli ones. Israel has fared far worse online than in surveys of overall public opinion. A poll of Americans by YouGov found three backers of Israel for every Palestinian supporter on October 20th—a day with twice as many pro-Palestinian posts on American social media as pro-Israeli ones. In Britain, another YouGov survey found equal support for each side that day, when the Palestinians won the British social-media battle by a six-to-one margin. One cause of this gap is age. Social-media users skew young, and such people are unusually pro-Palestinian in their views. Moreover, DMR’s sample did not include Facebook, which may be the most pro-Israel platform owing to its older users. In polls of people in Denmark, France, Spain and Sweden, Israel drew more total sympathy, but young participants’ opinions matched social-media ratios. Yet in America and Britain, social-media views are even more pro-Palestinian than those of young poll respondents. Israel’s backers show rather less zeal for online combat. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/why-israel-must-fight-on,"ISRAELI FORCES are entering a hellscape of their own making. One in ten buildings in Gaza has been pulverised by Israeli aircraft and artillery. Over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them children. Shortages of fuel, clean water and food, imposed by an Israeli blockade, pose a growing threat to the lives of many thousands more. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Around the world the cry is going up for a ceasefire or for Israel to abandon its ground invasion. Hearing some Israeli politicians call for vengeance, including the discredited prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, many people conclude that Israel’s actions are disproportionate and immoral. Many of those arguing this believe in the need for a Jewish state, but fear for a Jewish state that seems to value Palestinian lives so cheaply. They worry that the slender hopes for peace in this age-old conflict will be buried under Gaza’s rubble. Those are powerful arguments, but they lead to the wrong conclusion. Israel is inflicting terrible civilian casualties. It must minimise them and be seen to do so. Palestinians are lacking essential humanitarian supplies. Israel must let a lot more aid pass into Gaza. However, even if Israel chooses to honour these responsibilities, the only path to peace lies in dramatically reducing Hamas’s capacity to use Gaza as a source of supplies and a base for its army. Tragically, that requires war. To grasp why, you have to understand what happened on October 7th. When Israelis talk about Hamas’s attack as an existential threat they mean it literally, not as a figure of speech. Because of pogroms and the Holocaust, Israel has a unique social contract: to create a land where Jews know they will not be killed or persecuted for being Jews. The state has long honoured that promise with a strategic doctrine that calls for deterrence, early warnings of an attack, protection on the home front and decisive Israeli victories. Over the past two decades Israel lost sight of the fact that Palestinians deserve a state, too. Mr Netanyahu boosted Hamas to sabotage Palestinian moderates—a cynical ploy to help him argue that Israel has no partner for peace. Instead, Palestinian suffering became something to manage, with a mix of financial inducements and deterrence, kept fresh by repeated short wars. On October 7th Hamas destroyed all this, including Mr Netanyahu’s brittle scheme. The terrorists ripped apart Israel’s social contract by shattering the security doctrine created to defend it. Deterrence proved empty, early warning of an attack was absent, home-front protection failed and Hamas murdered 1,400 people in Israeli communities. Far from enjoying victory, Israel’s soldiers and spies were humiliated. The collapse of Israel’s security doctrine has unleashed a ferocious bombardment against the people of Gaza. The reason is an attempt to restore that founding principle. Israel wants its 200,000 or so evacuees to be able to return home. It wants to show its many enemies that it can still defend itself. Most of all, it has come to understand that, by choosing to murder Israelis regardless of how many Palestinians will die in Gaza, Hamas has proved that it is undeterrable. The only way out of the cycle of violence is to destroy Hamas’s rule—which means killing its senior leaders and smashing its military infrastructure. The suggestion that a war which entails the deaths of thousands of innocent people can lead to peace will appal many. In the past one act of violence has led to the next. That is indeed the great risk today. However, while Hamas runs Gaza, peace is impossible. Israelis will feel unsafe, so their government will strike Gaza pre-emptively every time Hamas threatens. Suffocated by permanently tight Israeli security and killed as Hamas’s human shields in pre-emptive Israeli raids, Palestinians will be radicalised. The only way forward is to weaken its control while building the conditions for something new to emerge. That starts with new leadership for both sides. In Israel Mr Netanyahu will be forced from office because he was in power on October 7th, and because his reputation for being Israel’s staunchest defender is broken. The sooner he goes the better. His successor will need to win a mandate for a new security doctrine. That should involve a plan for peace and reining in Israeli settlers, who even now are molesting and killing Palestinians on the West Bank. The Palestinians need moderate leaders with a democratic mandate. At the moment they have none. That is partly because Mr Netanyahu boosted Hamas, but also because Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian authority, has sidelined potential rivals. The question is how to stop Hamas or its successor from seizing back control of Gaza before fresh leaders can emerge from fair elections. Hence, the second condition for peace: a force to provide security in Gaza. Israel cannot supply it as an occupying power. Instead the strip needs an international coalition, possibly containing Arab countries that oppose Hamas and its backer, Iran. As we have argued in previous leaders, creating a coalition that all sides can agree on will take committed leadership from the United States and a leap of faith from the region. And that leads back to the condition that makes all this possible: a war to degrade Hamas enough to enable something better to take its place. How Israel fights this war matters. It must live up to its pledge to honour international law. Not only is that the right thing to do, but Israel will be able to sustain broad support over the months of fighting and find backing to foster peace when the fighting stops only if it signals that it has changed. Right now, this means letting in a lot more humanitarian aid and creating real safe zones in southern Gaza, Egypt, or—as the best talisman of its sincerity—in the Negev inside Israel. A ceasefire is the enemy of peace, because it would allow Hamas to continue to rule over Gaza by consent or by force with most of its weapons and fighters intact. The case for humanitarian pauses is stronger, but even they involve a trade-off. Repeated pauses would increase the likelihood that Hamas survives. Nobody can know whether peace will come to Gaza. But for the sake of Israelis and Palestinians it deserves to have the best possible chance. A ceasefire removes that chance entirely. ■"
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history,"ISraelis know they cannot take their physical safety for granted. But nothing in the country’s 75-year history could have prepared them for the carnage of October 7th. As The Economist went to press estimates of the number of Israelis killed in Hamas’s attack had reached 1,300, with a further 3,300 injured. Around 150 hostages are thought to have been taken to Gaza. The failure of Israeli intelligence to anticipate the attack is comparable to the start of the Yom Kippur war of 1973, when Egypt and Syria launched simultaneous surprise offensives on Judaism’s most important holiday. The number of civilian lives lost is, however, very different. In 1973 those invading armies sought to capture territory, not slaughter non-combatants. The 2,656 Israelis who died during the three-week war were all soldiers. In contrast, only around 13% of Hamas’s victims this week were active military personnel. Most of the victims were shot by gunmen who streamed across the border and reached as far as Ofakim, a city some 25km (15 miles) inside Israel. By current estimates, the most deadly attack took place at a music festival in the desert near Reim, a kibbutz around 5km from the border, where at least 260 people were murdered. At the same time Hamas fired an unprecedented barrage of mortars and rockets into the country, spreading fear over a wider area. Around 4,500 explosive projectiles were launched between October 7th and 9th—roughly as many as during an entire two-month war in 2014—causing blazes that were visible from space. The number of fires detected in Israel on October 7th by FIRMS, a NASA satellite system, was the second-highest of any day in the past decade, surpassed only by a spate of wildfires in 2020. Most were clustered around the border with Gaza, but some reached as far as the southern suburbs of Tel Aviv. The assault dwarfs all other mass murders of Israeli civilians. The bloodiest atrocity committed by Arabs during Israel’s war of independence, a massacre at Kfar Etzion, an Israeli settlement, in May 1948, left 127 people dead. And the deadliest previous attack by Palestinian terrorists, a bomb detonated at a Passover seder at a hotel in the city of Netanya in 2002, killed 30. The death toll from October 7th has already surpassed the total number of Israelis killed during the second intifada, a Palestinian uprising that lasted from 2000 to 2005. As a share of Israel’s population, it is equivalent to 12 September 11th attacks—a daily mortality rate exceeded only by full-scale wars, genocides or natural disasters. The most searing historical comparison predates Israel’s founding. Not all of Hamas’s victims were Israeli, and not all of the Israeli dead were Jewish. But under reasonable assumptions about the ethnic make-up of those killed in this and previous attacks, the last time before October 7th that this many Jews were murdered on a single day was during the Holocaust. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/29/israel-faces-agonising-choices-in-the-battle-for-gaza,"ARMIES CAN struggle to pursue a single war aim without being blown off course. Israel is pursuing four of them, and they are in tension with each other. Its forces have begun what on October 28th the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, called the second stage of the war—the ground invasion of Gaza. He warned that this phase will be “difficult and long” and he is right. Israel’s leaders will continuously have to balance those four competing objectives. Striving harder for one may frustrate all the others. The first war aim is to destroy Hamas. Over the past three weeks that has come to mean eradicating the group’s military infrastructure and killing its leadership and as many of its foot soldiers as possible. Because Hamas undertook a mass-attack to kill Jews, Israelis can no longer tolerate the old stand-off in which Hamas violence was supposed to have been kept at a tolerable level by a combination of financial rewards and the threat of Israeli attack. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas One reason for this is practical. For as long as Hamas is in power, Israelis will not feel secure. Many of the thousands who were evacuated from the south will not return home. Another reason is tactical. Hamas humiliated Israeli intelligence and the Israeli army. To lower the chances of similar attacks by other groups, the country needs to re-establish deterrence. The last reason is strategic. With Hamas in charge, there can be no peace process. The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians will remain stuck. It is a harsh truth for people being bombed, but Gazans, too, will remain in misery for as long as they live under Hamas’s dictatorship and the suffocating Israeli security that it entails. Israel’s second goal is to free more than 220 people who have been taken back to Gaza as hostages. This aim is likely to hamper the fighting. Hamas appears to have been using the promise of hostage releases to delay the start of the ground offensive. It is likely to try to influence Israeli tactics now that troops are inside Gaza, in the hope that the invading forces will hold back. The government in Jerusalem does not have a free hand with the hostages. Their importance looms large in Israeli politics because their friends and families fear that, without public pressure, Israeli leaders will strike a trade-off that favours eradicating Hamas. On October 28th, the morning after the biggest incursion into Gaza yet, the families complained about the risks the fighting poses to the hostages’ survival. The third goal is to minimise casualties—of both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians. If many Israeli troops die, it could threaten the entire operation. As civilian casualties mount, so will international pressure for humanitarian pauses and an outright ceasefire. In the past such factors have led Israel to go in hard and fast, in the knowledge that time for fighting is limited. Today, however, the aim is to wreck Hamas’s tunnel network. That will take many months. Yet the clock is already ticking fast. Even as civilians are killed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, they are also caught up in its siege tactics, especially over supplies of energy. Israel is trying to create bargaining power for the release of the hostages by stopping any fuel from getting into the strip. It faces a dilemma because it believes that hospital generators also provide the electricity needed to ventilate and light Hamas’s labyrinth of tunnels, where its fighters lurk. And Israel has encouraged the mass movement of civilians to the south of the strip where the bombardment is less intense. The terrible conditions that all these things are creating within the strip pose a grave threat to civilian lives. Israeli officials acknowledge that the ground offensive, which they describe with the sanitised word “manoeuvre”, must operate under international law and that this law requires them to facilitate supplies of essential aid. For the war to be sustained, Israel will therefore have to find ways to help, even if that makes it harder to eliminate Hamas and get the hostages released. The last goal is to lay the foundations for restarting work in the Middle East on an eventual peace, a process that has been stalled for years. Just now the idea of a post-war arrangement between Israel and the Palestinians in East Jerusalem, Gaza and on the West Bank is unthinkable for many on both sides, but hard-headed Israeli strategists believe that the prospect of genuine peace will be needed to create lasting stability. This will require the backing of at least some Arab governments, most likely those that have drawn closer to Israel under the Abraham accords. America will lend its weight, by pressing them to give cash and diplomatic support. Some even imagine Arab states also providing security in Gaza after Israel moves out. In some ways many Arab governments are on Israel’s side, though they would never admit it publicly. They loathe Hamas and its sponsor, Iran, and would be happy to see it fail. But civilian deaths stir up trouble among their citizens. Western governments are also jittery. More than half of the hostages carry foreign passports and they worry about the radicalisation of their own Muslim populations. Israel’s ground operation is trying to accomplish a lot—too much, probably. At the moment, the country’s generals look as if they are trying to square all the circles by going slowly and hitting as hard as they dare. They deserve to win. They have the firepower to win. But they will struggle to accomplish everything that is being asked of them. Israel may yet have to choose what it wants most. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/07/will-america-pull-the-plug-on-israels-invasion-of-gaza,"Israel’s ground offensive is entering a dangerous new stage, nearly two weeks after it began. On November 5th the Israel Defence Forces (idf) unleashed a series of devastating air strikes in and around Gaza city. The goal was to damage Hamas’s tunnel networks. Israeli troops are now operating in the city’s centre, where they believe Hamas has its underground headquarters, having encircled it from three sides. The advance units on different axes are now so close to each other that one of their chief concerns is avoiding “friendly fire” incidents. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Israel’s forces have penetrated far farther into Gaza than in the ground campaigns of 2009 and 2014. They believe they are getting closer to their stated goal of destroying Hamas, in particular its leadership, which Israeli intelligence believes to be holed up under the Shifa hospital (Israel claims it has evidence that Hamas is using other hospitals in the city as cover too; Hamas says this is a “false narrative”). Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defence minister, said on November 7th that Israeli forces had Yahya Sinwar, the current head of Hamas in Gaza, surrounded (he did not specify where). But to get to Hamas’s headquarters, the idf must first get through the group’s defensive lines. On November 4th The Economist was invited by the idf to accompany troops to the front line. Over the course of several hours no civilians were seen. Officers and soldiers said they had sighted only a handful since entering Gaza city on October 27th. Around three-quarters of the 1m-strong civilian population is estimated to have heeded the idf’s warnings and fled south, away from the part of the city which Israeli troops are now encircling. But for the generals preparing the battle plans, the diplomatic clock is ticking. In horrific scenes over 10,000 Palestinians have already been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas. More than 11% of Gaza’s buildings have been damaged or destroyed. That explains why Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, received a chilly reception as he shuttled across the Middle East in recent days. Anger is mounting across the region. In Amman his Jordanian counterpart, Ayman Safadi, told Mr Blinken to “stop this madness”. The language he heard in private across the region was even tougher. His meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, lasted less than an hour and ended with no joint statement. Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey did not bother to meet him at all. Israeli generals still talk about waging a long campaign that will last up to a year. On November 7th Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told abc News that Israel would be in charge of Gaza’s security for an “indefinite period”. In practice, though, what Israeli officers call their “window of legitimacy” is probably far shorter. How fast that window closes will depend largely on America, which is supplying Israel with munitions, diplomatic support and an aid package worth perhaps $14bn. If Joe Biden wants the war to end, Israel will be hard-pressed to ignore him. So far, he does not. Although he now supports “humanitarian pauses” to allow more aid to enter Gaza, Mr Biden has rejected calls for an outright ceasefire. But administration officials have made clear, in a series of leaks, that they doubt Israel has a coherent exit strategy in Gaza. They complain that Mr Netanyahu is barely willing to discuss the topic, and say they want to put their concerns on the record now lest the war end badly. They also have concerns about Israeli tactics. Asked about the IDF’s efforts to minimise civilian deaths, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, practically tied himself in knots: “We have seen some indications that there are efforts being applied in certain scenarios to try to minimise [them],” he said. To think a war risks becoming a devastating quagmire but to support it nonetheless is an untenable position—especially when many American voters agree. An Associated Press poll found that 58% of Democrats think Israel’s response has gone too far and 44% think America is too supportive of it. A Quinnipiac survey of registered voters found that 51% of independents and 66% of people aged 18-34 disapprove of Mr Biden’s policy. His ratings have plummeted among Arab-American voters, which could hurt him next year in crucial swing states like Michigan. Sources in Washington think it will still be several more weeks before Mr Biden pivots to talk of a truce—but do not doubt that he will make such a shift. Arab states certainly hope so. Fears of a multi-front war, which were acute in the days after Hamas’s massacre, have eased. Hizbullah, a Lebanese Shia militia, is still firing rockets daily at Israel, but Hassan Nasrallah, the group’s leader, signalled in a speech on November 3rd that he was not yet keen on all-out war. The Houthis, a Shia militant group in Yemen, have lobbed drones and missiles at Israel but are too far away to pose a strategic threat. Many regional autocrats would be happy to see Israel smash Hamas. But they are also nervous that the war will mobilise their subjects, many of whom are already restive about awful economic conditions. This adds to pressure on both America, which has heard their fears for weeks now, and Israel, which is keen to preserve its recent diplomatic gains in the Arab world. So far, most countries have made do with symbolic rebukes of Israel. On November 2nd the lower house of Bahrain’s parliament announced that the country would recall its ambassador from Israel. The chamber has few powers; recalling ambassadors is not one of them. Envoys from both countries had gone home weeks earlier. Parliament, in a fit of populism, made it seem as if lawmakers had decreed their return. Officials in both Bahrain and Israel say diplomatic ties remain intact. Four days later King Abdullah of Jordan announced that his air force had dropped a shipment of medical aid into Gaza. Jordan would not have taken such action without seeking Israel’s approval, which the Israeli army later confirmed it had indeed given. By omitting that detail from his announcement, though, the king could act as if he had challenged Israel’s blockade of Gaza. Such gestures do not earn much goodwill at home, however. Even the United Arab Emirates (uae), Israel’s closest Arab ally, has grown increasingly critical (at least in public). Anwar Gargash, a foreign-policy adviser to the uae’s president, said at a conference on November 4th that America should push for a ceasefire, “the quicker the better”. Then there is Israel itself. Morale is high in the army and Israelis seem willing to accept far more casualties than normal (36 Israeli soldiers have been killed so far). But the public is furious with a prime minister more concerned with political survival than battlefield strategy. Protesters gathered at Mr Netanyahu’s house on November 4th to demand his resignation. Another question is the economy. The month-long Lebanon war in 2006 cost around 9.5bn shekels ($2bn at the time, or 1.3% of GDP), whereas the last big Gaza conflict in 2014 cost 7bn shekels (0.6% of GDP). This one may be even costlier. The Bank of Israel thinks the government’s deficit will climb to 3% of gdp next year, compared with a 0.6% surplus in 2022; some outsiders put the estimate above 5%. Mobilising 360,000 reservists has left parts of Israel’s economy with a shortage of workers, even if some of them have now been sent home. Israeli officials hope the next phase of the war will change these considerations. If the idf can destroy the facilities it has surrounded in Gaza city and kill large numbers of militants, it hopes Hamas’s chain of command will be broken. Some leaders may escape, either through tunnels or disguised among evacuees, to southern Gaza. But Israel believes that having them on the run will weaken Hamas. That could allow a shift in strategy. “We can change tactics, have fewer forces inside Gaza, and attack Hamas strongholds in a series of smaller raids,” says one general. That in turn could ease international pressure, which spikes every time Israeli jets bomb a bakery or a refugee camp, and ease pressure on the economy by allowing the army to release some reservists. The Israelis also recognise that relieving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza could buy more time. On November 6th the UAE announced that it would set up a 150-bed field hospital in Gaza, a move co-ordinated with Israel. On November 8th Israel said 50,000 more people had fled north Gaza through a temporary civilian corridor. Arguably, though, the biggest challenge to Israel’s international legitimacy is Mr Netanyahu himself. His government is stacked with radicals. Amichai Eliyahu, the heritage minister, recently suggested dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza. Zvi Sukkot, the new head of a parliamentary committee that oversees the occupied West Bank, is a far-right ideologue who has been investigated by Israel’s Shin Bet for his alleged extremist activity. When they met in Ramallah, Mr Abbas told Mr Blinken that the Palestinian Authority, which controls parts of the West Bank, could return to Gaza to govern the enclave after the war. Such an outcome would please both the Israeli army and the Americans. But Mr Abbas added that it would happen only “within the framework of a comprehensive political solution”—in other words, as a step towards a two-state solution, which Mr Netanyahu has spent his entire career fighting against. On November 8th Mr Blinken offered a more pointed criticism of Israel’s post-war plans. There could be no permanent reoccupation of Gaza, he said, nor any forced displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza. He also ruled out any reduction in its territory (some Israeli officials have proposed creating a larger “buffer zone” around Gaza, on land carved out of the enclave). Mr Netanyahu has not ruled out any of these. If he stays in office, there will be no serious talk of an endgame. America’s patience will run out and Israel will find its room for manoeuvre increasingly limited. ■ Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/28/israels-new-plan-to-encircle-hamas,"AS NIGHT FELL over the Gaza Strip on October 27th, the Palestinian mobile-phone networks in the coastal enclave stopped working. Rumours soon spread that Israel had begun a ground invasion of the territory. A terse statement from the army confirmed that ground operations were “expanding” but offered no other details. The few cameras that offered a view into Gaza captured some of the fiercest bombardment yet in the three-week war between Israel and Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls the strip. Sunrise brought a bit more clarity. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) had indeed entered Gaza from two points: around Beit Hanoun, a town in the north, and Bureij, near the narrow midpoint of the 45km-long strip. Relentless air strikes and artillery had provided cover for dozens of tanks and other armoured vehicles carrying infantry and combat-engineering troops. The incursion seemed bigger than the raids of the previous two nights, which were small and lasted only a few hours before troops returned to Israeli territory. This time they remained inside and established temporary strongholds within Gaza’s borders. Still, it was hardly the division-sized attack that the Israeli army had been signalling for the past few weeks, since Hamas murdered more than 1,400 Israelis (mostly civilians) on October 7th. In interviews over the past several days, IDF officials said the aims of the war remain unchanged: to isolate and destroy Hamas’s military infrastructure, particularly its network of underground tunnels, and to remove it from control of Gaza’s government. But the army’s tactics are not what they were assumed to be in the days after the massacre. The two locations where Israel entered on October 27th—north and south of Gaza city, the enclave’s largest urban area—suggest a gradual plan to encircle it. One senior officer describes the ground offensive as a campaign that will take months, perhaps a year. Some Israeli politicians have begun to argue that a big ground offensive would play into Hamas’s hands, drawing the IDF into urban fighting for which Hamas has surely prepared ambushes and booby traps. It would also cause significant civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure in Gaza, which would create international pressure for a ceasefire. Israeli strikes have already killed more than 7,000 Palestinians in the enclave, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. “I don’t want us to get bogged down there without achieving our goal of dismantling Hamas,” says Naftali Bennett, who served a one-year stint as prime minister until June 2022. A slower campaign would rely, in effect, on siege tactics. Hamas has stockpiled fuel, food and other essentials in its labyrinth of tunnels. At some point, though, supplies will run out: a lack of fuel for generators would mean no fresh air or lights underground, which would force Hamas to surface. “Hamas doesn’t expect this at all. It expects a ground invasion for three to six weeks,” Mr Bennett argues. Israel’s tactics are constrained already by the more than 220 hostages abducted on October 7th by Hamas and other factions. Their families have put pressure on the Israeli government to prioritise their release. So have foreign governments: at least 41 countries have citizens in captivity (around a quarter of the hostages are thought to be migrant farm workers from Thailand). Hamas has released just four women thus far. There are ongoing talks, mostly via Qatar, the Gulf state which is one of Hamas’s patrons, to free more. One Israeli official says the limited size of the ground campaign is an effort to balance competing priorities: to show that Israel is prepared to attack, while leaving room for a hostage deal. Still, even the incursion on October 27th was enough to anger the families. They called it “the worst of all nights” in a statement the next morning, which bemoaned the “complete uncertainty regarding the fate of the abductees who are being held there and are also subject to the heavy bombardment”. The presence of so many Palestinian civilians is another constraint. On October 13th the IDF told the residents of northern Gaza, more than 1m people, to flee south. Around two-thirds of the civilian population is thought to have heeded that order—which still leaves a vast number of people in the area Israel is encircling. The mobile-phone outage during the October 27th bombardment made it impossible to call ambulances. Witnesses in Gaza say people brought the dead and wounded to hospitals on tuk-tuks. Even in the “safe” zone, conditions are intolerable. Israel has continued air strikes in the south (though they are less intense than those in the north). It has not allowed any supplies to enter Gaza via its border. Aid began to trickle across from Egypt on October 21st, after Israel lifted a veto on the deliveries, but it is woefully inadequate. Just 84 lorries of food, water and medicine have entered in the past week; the United Nations says 100 lorries a day are needed. Israel still refuses to allow fuel into Gaza. The IDF said this week that Hamas’s underground headquarters is located beneath Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest, and that the same generators which provide electricity for medical treatment also power ventilation systems and communication networks in the tunnels below (Hamas denies these claims). For Israel, then, the blockade on fuel is a military necessity. For civilians, though, it is a source of growing misery. Gaza’s sole power station shut down on October 11th. Overcrowded hospitals rely on generators for electricity (several have run out of fuel). There are hours-long queues for meagre supplies of bread at the few bakeries that still have fuel for their ovens. Israeli politicians insist they will not send any aid to Gaza until all of the hostages are freed. Army officials have begun to acknowledge this position is untenable, saying a prolonged war will require them to oversee a humanitarian effort. On October 27th the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution that called for an immediate “humanitarian truce”. The vote was 120-14, with 45 abstentions. America, which rejects any talk of a ceasefire, was one of the “no” votes. “We’re not drawing red lines for Israel,” said John Kirby, a White House spokesman, on October 27th. Still, it has started pushing Israel for “humanitarian pauses”, temporary lulls that would allow more aid to enter and let people with foreign citizenship leave Gaza through Egypt. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, has also endorsed the idea. Army officials also hope a more gradual war will keep other fronts quiet. Iran continues to make threats—and not only to Israel. “If the US continues what it has been doing so far, then new fronts will be opened up against the US,” said Hossein Amirabdollahian, the foreign minister, in an interview with Bloomberg on October 27th. Iranian-backed militias have already carried out at least 19 drone or missile attacks against American bases in Syria and Iraq. On October 26th the Pentagon said it had conducted retaliatory air strikes against Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Syria. None of this is unusual, however. Those militias have been attacking American bases for years, although such attacks had subsided since March with an undeclared truce linked to prisoner-swap talks between America and Iran. The events of the past few weeks are a reversion to the norm, in other words, not a major escalation. Worries about a second front in northern Israel have also subsided. In the days after the Hamas attack Israel called up 360,000 reservists, many of whom were sent to reinforce the border with Lebanon amid fears of a similar assault by Hizbullah, the Shia militant group and political party. Though tensions remain high, Israel believes Hizbullah and Iran, its patron, are wary of broadening the conflict. Both Israeli and Arab officials say Hizbullah has suffered more casualties than expected—it admits around 50 of its militants have been killed so far—and may be reassessing its tactics. The Israeli army may consider sending home some of its reservists, whose mobilisation is a heavy burden on the economy. A slower war, coupled with a serious effort to provide humanitarian aid, could ease some of the pressure on Israel. But it would not solve the strategic dilemma of how to uproot Hamas or what to replace it with—questions which Israeli officials admit they have yet to answer. And it is little comfort to civilians in Gaza, who would be fated to endure months of displacement and despair. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/22/are-the-abraham-accords-over,"IT FEELS like an image from an alternate reality. Hundreds of bankers and executives will descend on Riyadh this week for the Future Investment Initiative, a flashy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”. The money men will try to pretend it is business as usual but the Middle East is boiling. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas The war between Israel and Hamas is threatening to trigger a broader conflict that draws in the Gulf states, whose booming economies are key to global oil and gas markets. On October 20th an American destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted cruise missiles that Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen fired towards Israel. That day President Joe Biden said the goal of Hamas’s attack was to prevent a peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. “I was about to sit down with the Saudis….the Saudis wanted to recognise Israel,” he said. The oil price, a barometer of regional escalation risk, has hit $92 per barrel. Gulf states had hoped this would be a year of de-escalation in the region. They wanted calm to focus on ambitious plans to diversify their economies. Now the region’s oldest conflict has roared back to life. For one Gulf monarchy, Qatar, which has supported Hamas, the immediate goal is self-preservation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), however, want to weaken Hamas, forestall a wider confrontation with Iran and somehow keep alive their vision of an autocratic but more peaceful and prosperous region. It is a delicate and dangerous balancing act. Qatar looks vulnerable. It is both an American ally and a supporter of Hamas. Since October 7th, when Hamas militants murdered more than 1,400 people in Israel, those ties have become a source of embarrassment and nervousness. Some of Hamas’s leadership lives in Doha, the Qatari capital. The gas-rich emirate donates up to $30m a month to Hamas-run Gaza. For years Qatar has told allies that its ties with Hamas were a benefit: it could be an interlocutor between those groups and the West. For now Qatar is scrambling to show that it can still be useful to America. On October 20th Hamas freed two of the more than 200 hostages it seized during the rampage, both American-Israeli dual citizens, in a deal that Qatar helped broker. But there are also signs of denial and panic in the tiny, wealthy state. On October 14th, a Qatari diplomat contacted your correspondent to say that Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, was not in Doha but in Turkey. Hours later, Iran’s foreign minister held a televised meeting with Mr Haniyeh—in Doha. Qatar’s ties with Islamist groups were one reason why four Arab states imposed a travel-and-trade embargo on the tiny emirate in 2017. When the dust settles on this war, the country could come under greater American pressure to sever its links with militant groups. The UAE, which in 2020 became the first Gulf state to recognise Israel, has taken a different stance. Unlike most of its neighbours, its initial statement on the October 7th attack was one of sympathy with Israel, and its leaders made multiple condolence calls to their Israeli counterparts. They loathe political Islam, which they see as a threat, and in private are scathing in their criticism of Hamas. Hours after the explosion at Gaza’s Ahli Arab hospital on October 17th, the Israeli army denied that it targeted the facility in an air strike (and the evidence, so far, seems to support its denial). The UAE still joined other Arab states in condemning Israel. Such statements, however, should be taken as diplomatic theatre: ties between the two countries remain solid. Saudi Arabia has tried to chart a middle course. Its response to the Hamas attack was to cite a list of Israel’s past misdeeds and call for an immediate ceasefire—the sort of statement it always issues after flare-ups in the Holy Land. But there are also signs that its stance has shifted. On October 17th Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who led the kingdom’s intelligence service from 1979 to 2001, spoke in English to an American think-tank. His words carry weight as a former mandarin and a member of the royal family. He denounced Hamas for killing civilians and suggested it was un-Islamic. He condemned Israel too, for both its “indiscriminate bombing” in Gaza this month and the crimes of its half-century occupation. He made little mention of Iran, which is Saudi Arabia’s regional nemesis and one of Hamas’s main backers. A day later Al Arabiya, a Saudi-owned news channel, aired a tough interview with Khaled Meshaal, the former head of Hamas. Rasha Nabil, the presenter, asked him repeatedly how Hamas could expect support from other Arab countries after it made a unilateral decision to go to war, pressed him to condemn the murder of Israeli civilians and needled him on whether Iran’s help had “lived up to your expectations”. It was an interview the likes of which Hamas officials are almost never subjected to on Arabic-language channels. Mr Meshaal seemed rattled. Clips of the interview were widely shared on social media and even on Israeli television. Three conclusions can be drawn about Saudi Arabia’s intentions. First, it wants to undercut Hamas. Second, it wants to avoid a broader confrontation with Iran. Prince Turki implied that rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran was still alive. The two foes agreed in March to reopen embassies and ease their years-long feud. The Saudis are nervous that a regional war could lead to Iranian-sponsored attacks on the kingdom, like the one in 2019 that briefly disabled half of its oil production. Lastly, Saudi Arabia is not shutting the door on normalisation with Israel. America spent much of this year pushing for a deal that would have seen the Saudis recognise Israel; the kingdom wanted a defence pact with America in return. The Saudis had seemed content to push for token gestures toward the Palestinians—not an end to the occupation, merely to make it less painful. Now Muhammad bin Salman (pictured), the Saudi crown prince and the country’s de facto ruler has called for the creation of a Palestinian state along the region’s pre-1967 borders. Talks with Israel will continue, albeit more quietly than before, but the price for Israel will now be higher. Much now depends on the nature of Israel’s looming ground invasion of Gaza: as the civilian death toll rises the Gulf states will come under growing pressure at home and across the Arab world to condemn Israel and sever ties. Still one thing the Gulf leaders can all agree on: they want the war to end. The financiers gathering in Riyadh this week want to talk about billion-dollar ideas for travel, trade and tourism. None of them is likely to come to fruition if there is a risk of missiles flying overhead.■"
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/18/a-short-history-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict,"Visit our dedicated hub for coverage of Israel and Hamas. HOW HAVE Israel’s borders changed over time? And why did Palestinian autonomous territories end up scattered in two separate regions? The shifting lines on the map help to explain more than a century of conflict between Arabs and Jews in the Holy Land. Our explanation begins in 1916 (see map 1). During the first world war Sir Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, and François Georges-Picot, a French one, were appointed by their governments to secretly divvy up the lands of the Ottoman empire. The Arab provinces were to be split up among European powers. Palestine was envisioned as international territory given its significance in Christianity, Islam and Judaism. In 1917 Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, stating its support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”. By then Jewish agricultural settlement in Palestine had already begun, and the Zionist movement, founded by Theodor Herzl, had declared its aim to create a Jewish homeland at its first congress in Basel in 1897. The San Remo Conference of 1920 finalised the partition of the Ottoman empire.  Britain was given a mandate to rule parts of the international territory envisioned under Sykes-Picot. This was split again the following year into Palestine and Transjordan, an Arab kingdom under Hashemite rule. The mandate was approved by the League of Nations, a forerunner to the United Nations, in 1922. Importantly, it included support for the Balfour Declaration. Arabs living there turned increasingly to violence against their occupiers and growing numbers of Jewish migrants, including German Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1936 the Arabs revolted. The British crushed the uprising, but tried to win over the Arabs by restricting Jewish ambitions in the region. Jewish militant groups began launching their own revolt which spread after the second world war. Eventually the British gave up and handed the problem over to the UN. After the Holocaust, pressure grew for the international recognition of a Jewish state. In 1947 the UN proposed the partition of Palestine into three parts: an Arab state, a Jewish state and Jerusalem, which was intended to be a corpus separatum, or a separate, internationally run entity. Violence only worsened. As Britain completed its withdrawal in 1948 Jewish leaders declared the establishment of the state of Israel. Neighbouring Arab countries promptly invaded. Israel survived the Arab invasion. In the Armistice of 1949 a demarcation line (known as the “Green Line”) served as the de facto borders between Israel and Arab states, though the Arab governments refused to recognise Israel. More than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were pushed out of their homes. They called this the nakba, the catastrophe. The Gaza Strip and the West Bank came under the control of Egypt and Transjordan (later Jordan), respectively. Jerusalem was divided. In 1967, during the six-day war between Israel and its Arab neighbours, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai peninsula. It annexed East Jerusalem, along with a slice of the West Bank, and moved to build Jewish settlements in the occupied lands. In October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria launched an attack in Sinai and the Golan Heights. Under American auspices, Israel and Egypt signed the Camp David accords in 1978 and a peace treaty the following year. Israel agreed to give back all of Sinai, and to grant Palestinians autonomy. Outraged Arab countries kicked Egypt out of the Arab league, and there was no progress on Palestinian autonomy. In 1987 Palestinians rose up, in what became known as the first intifada, a sustained movement of strikes and stone-throwing protests. In 1993 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation signed the first Oslo accord, which set out a five-year period of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under a new entity, the Palestinian Authority (PA). The interim arrangements created a messy patchwork in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip: in Area A the PA was given full civil and security control; in Area B it had civil-affairs and some law-and-order powers, but Israel retained ultimate security control; and in Area C Israel kept full control. The accord left the final status of Jerusalem and settlements to be sorted out later. During the second intifada, which lasted from 2000 to 2005 and involved the use of guns and suicide bombs by Palestinians, Israel built a security barrier in the West Bank and eventually withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip. In the West Bank it pulled out of four settlements. Today almost 3m Palestinians live in the West Bank, as well as more than 450,000 Israelis living in settlements (excluding East Jerusalem), a figure that has grown roughly fourfold since the Oslo accords were signed. Some settlers have now lived in the West Bank for two generations. Jerusalem is ringed with settlements. Palestinians in Gaza fare considerably worse than those elsewhere. The region has been controlled by Hamas, a militant group, since 2007. After it came to power, Egypt and Israel tightened a stifling blockade on the territory. Hamas militants and Israel have now been at war five times. The latest fighting has been the deadliest yet.■"
https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/05/did-hamas-make-millions-trading-the-october-7th-attacks,"Before its attack on October 7th, Hamas maintained tight operational security. The assault blindsided Israel’s spies, and seems to have surprised even Hamas’s political leaders. But did someone know enough to profit? A new paper by Robert Jackson Jr, a former commissioner of America’s Securities and Exchange Commission, and Joshua Mitts of Columbia University suggests so. The authors’ most striking finding is a surge in short sales—bets that a security’s price will fall—of an exchange-traded fund (etf) listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker eis, which tracks an index of Israeli shares. In September an average of 1,581 shares a day of EIS were sold short, representing 17% of the daily total trading volume. On October 2nd, five days before the attacks, a whopping 227,820 shares were shorted, representing 99% of total volume. Rather than reflecting a souring of market sentiment, the increase in activity seems to have come from just two trades. Then, on the first trading day after the attack, standard “long” transactions outnumbered short sales by a similar number of shares (248,009). If these trades were made by the same investor, they would correspond to a $1m profit. Other securities also showed suspicious patterns. During the three weeks before the attacks, the number of outstanding options contracts expiring on October 13th on American-traded shares of Israeli firms—the derivatives that would yield the greatest returns if prices moved sharply in the direction a trader expected—rose eightfold. In contrast, the number of longer-dated options on such shares, whose value depended on events beyond mid-October, barely changed. The paper’s authors examined other periods of turmoil in Israel, such as that prompted by the government’s attempted judicial reform earlier this year, and did not detect similar behaviour. The only match was in April—two days before Passover, which according to reporting by an Israeli tv station was the date originally scheduled for the attack. Critics of the paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggest that the activity could reflect investors closing positions on the first day of a quarter, or have been a market-maker’s response to a trader buying up shares in the fund. Yet no surge has occurred at the start of any other quarter since 2009. The authors say that had any large purchases of eis been made to offset the shorts, such transactions would appear in their data. Another objection is that although a big short sale should in theory drive down prices, eis actually rose in value. In response, the authors note that the fund’s value is tied to the prices of the shares it contains, and that the shorts of EIS were tiny in comparison with the market capitalisation of the firms the fund tracks. The study has prompted an inquiry by Israel’s securities authority. Assigning motives to trading activity is always hard; the authors cannot rule out benign explanations. But they argue that the most plausible account is that whoever made the trades was familiar with Hamas’s secrets. Although the millions of dollars in potential profits are small, Mr Mitts notes they are a lower limit identifiable with public data. He thinks that they could be “just the tip of the iceberg”.■ Editor’s note (December 7th 2023): This article has been updated to include criticism of the study and the authors’ response to it."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/13/what-is-israels-iron-beam,"FOR EVERY ten incoming rockets, Israel’s system of defensive mobile batteries, the Iron Dome, typically shoots down nine. Israel claims to have maintained that ratio even as Hamas has fired bigger salvoes from Gaza in the aftermath of the Islamist group’s attack on Israel on October 7th. However, Iron Dome has limitations. Chiefly, replenishing interceptor stocks, even with American manufacturing help, is pricey. Reported costs for a single interceptor, called Tamir, range from $40,000 to more than double that. Israel thus plans to deploy laser air defences. It would be the first country to set up such a system. How does Iron Beam, as the system has been dubbed, actually work? Israel’s defence ministry decided to build out Iron Beam last year after it destroyed rockets, mortars, drones and anti-tank rounds in tests. As Naftali Bennett, then prime minister, put it, Israel would erect a “laser wall”. Operations were expected to begin in perhaps 2025. Now, with war raging, the timeline is being crunched. The big selling-point, says Uzi Rubin, a former head of the defence ministry’s Israel Missile Defence Organisation, is Iron Beam’s unlimited magazine. Laser shots are “manufactured on the run”, he notes, each with a few dollars’ worth of diesel in an electricity generator. Iron Beam is a technological marvel. The mobile laser guns use a complex configuration of mirrors to redirect photons from light-emitting diodes into a single beam. To prevent the mirrors from melting, they were designed with exceptional reflectivity and cooling systems. After 10km of travel, an Iron Beam laser reportedly has the diameter of a coin and is stunningly precise, despite the distorting effects of wind and air temperatures. But however fearsome Iron Beam’s 100-kilowatt (kW) lasers, Dr Rubin cautions that widespread expectations of “Star Wars performance” are unrealistic. Experts reckon that Iron Beam’s range, at best, will be just over a third that of Tamir interceptors, which can hit targets even 70km away. The system’s state-owned Israeli developer, Rafael, has spoken of a range of “several miles”. One constraint is that weather can affect the system—moisture and particles, like smoke, absorb laser energy. Another drawback is “dwell time”. It takes several seconds of contact for an Iron Beam laser to pump enough energy into a spinning rocket for it to break apart or explode. An Iron Beam gun will therefore be unable to parry a heavy barrage, so the system will be used alongside Iron Dome, which fires interceptor volleys rapidly. Iron Beam will also draw targeting data from Iron Dome’s network of radars and fast computers. And the new system’s lasers might be best suited to fighting slower attack drones, which do not spin and rely on relatively delicate rotors, wing flaps and guidance systems, so they can be shot down with briefer laser blasts. One worry is that Hamas and other militant groups might manage to sheath rockets in a heat-resistant material. And the set-up cost of Iron Beam’s batteries is considerable (though not disclosed). Yaakov Amidror, a retired major general and former head of Israel’s National Security Council, says that it remains to be seen whether Iron Beam shoots down enough rockets to justify the investment. Other laser air defences are in the pipeline. Lockheed Martin signed, in December 2022, a deal with Rafael to jointly develop a variant of Iron Beam for America’s forces and, potentially, their allies. The US Air Force Research Lab’s “directed energy” team in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is developing 300kW-class lasers to defeat what wargaming suggests could otherwise become “overwhelming salvoes” of missiles, according to Nicholas Morley, a senior scientist at the lab.■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/02/the-pace-of-israels-war-in-gaza-far-exceeds-previous-conflicts,"THE WORLD shook, and then the ground opened. On October 31st Israeli jets carried out air strikes in Jabalia, a refugee camp in northern Gaza. A witness reported hearing multiple explosions, which left huge craters. Videos from the site showed apocalyptic scenes: buildings crumpled and canted at odd angles, dead bodies being pulled from the rubble. Dozens were killed. The Israeli army said it was targeting the underground headquarters of a Hamas commander, Ibrahim Biari, and militants with him, and that much of the damage was caused when tunnels collapsed. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas The war between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, is nearing the end of its first month, and it is already the bloodiest conflict between Israelis and Palestinians since 1948. Since it began on October 7th, when Hamas murdered more than 1,400 Israelis, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has struck more than 11,000 targets in Gaza, far exceeding the pace of previous wars. The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 8,800 Palestinians have been killed, including some 3,500 children. Large parts of northern Gaza, normally home to more than 1m people, have been reduced to rubble. Much of Israel’s formidable border fence with Gaza is gone. Hamas breached it in 29 separate locations during its attack, and Israel has dismantled more of it to facilitate the entry of armoured battalions. Israeli troops entered Gaza on October 27th from two places: near Beit Hanoun in the north, and at a point just south of Gaza city in the narrow waist of the 45km-long strip. Their goal is to bisect Gaza and gradually encircle the northern part of the enclave, which they have told civilians to evacuate. Hamas does not want a head-on fight with an advancing IDF, which has vastly superior firepower. Instead it will seek to harass Israeli troops with guerrilla warfare. Israeli military sources think they have only a short window of opportunity in which to operate with large formations inside Gaza. They will try to destroy tunnels and command centres to disrupt Hamas’s freedom of movement and divide its fighters. In the coming weeks, Israeli generals expect international pressure will force them to revert to a more limited presence inside Gaza. The war will shift to raids against specific targets. These, they predict, will take months, perhaps even a year. About two-thirds of northern Gaza’s population is thought to have heeded the evacuation order. That still leaves hundreds of thousands of people. Conditions in the south, supposedly a safe zone, are dire. More than half of Gaza’s population—1.4m people—has been displaced. Shelters are overflowing: one un facility in Khan Younis, the first city south of the evacuation line, now houses 22,100 people, more than ten times its intended capacity. Essential supplies are still scarce. Around 250 lorries have entered Gaza since October 21st, when Israel lifted its veto on aid deliveries. Martin Griffiths, the un’s top humanitarian official, calls the deliveries thus far a “drop in the ocean compared to the vast scale of needs”. Israel still refuses to allow shipments of fuel to Gaza, arguing that this will eventually force Hamas fighters, who need it to light and ventilate their tunnels, to move above ground. The sole power plant ran out of fuel on October 11th. One-third of Gaza’s hospitals and two-thirds of its clinics are closed, either because they have no fuel left or because they were damaged by Israeli bombardment. After weeks of delay, people with foreign citizenships were allowed to leave Gaza via Rafah on November 1st. Egypt also allowed ambulances with injured Palestinians into its territory for treatment. But it refuses to open its border for refugees. As the fighting expands, so has the dysfunction in Binyamin Netanyahu’s government. Many Israelis hold the prime minister responsible for the failures leading up to Hamas’s attack. Though the army and intelligence chiefs were also culpable, they are much more popular than he is. Half of Israelis told pollsters they trust IDF commanders to lead the country in war. Just a tiny minority trusts Mr Netanyahu more. This has enraged the prime minister, which compounds the divisions within Israel’s war cabinet. Officials present at its meetings have described a “traumatic” atmosphere. The day after ground forces entered Gaza, Mr Netanyahu took to X (formerly Twitter) and blamed intelligence and security chiefs for their assessment, before the October 7th attacks, that “Hamas was deterred and sought accommodation.” He deleted the post after public criticism from members of the war cabinet. The divisions are affecting military decision-making. They explain why IDF soldiers sat in staging areas near the Gaza strip for two weeks until the order to go in was given. “The army took a terrible hit but is now standing on its two feet,” says one senior official. “The same can’t be said for the rest of the government.” The public is also furious with Mr Netanyahu for his handling of the hostage crisis. At least 240 people were abducted during the Hamas raid and brought back to Gaza. Four have been released, and on October 30th Israel said its forces had freed a soldier, Ori Megidish, captured during the Hamas assault. There are ongoing talks via Qatar, which has close ties with Hamas, about a deal to free more hostages.  As the ground offensive grinds on, Israel will have to decide whether to release more of the 360,000 reservists called up after Oct 7th. Their mobilisation is a growing burden on the Israeli economy. Some in the war cabinet, however, would like to take advantage of the country’s war footing and attack Hizbullah, the Shia militant group in Lebanon that has been firing rockets and anti-tank missiles at Israel. Those attacks have reached steadily further into Israeli territory. On October 29th a rocket hit a house in Kiryat Shmona, the largest city on its northern border; another barrage was aimed at Rosh Pina, 14km from the Lebanese border. Israel’s retaliatory strikes have also moved deeper into Lebanon. Still, the view in both Israel and Lebanon is that Hizbullah does not wish to expand the fighting much further. Hassan Nasrallah, the group’s leader, was due to make a speech on November 3rd, his first public appearance since the war began. His silence is unusual. But he is under intense domestic pressure to keep Lebanon out of the war. A survey published in al-Akhbar, a Lebanese daily sympathetic to Hizbullah, found that 68% of Lebanese opposed opening a full-fledged war with Israel. On October 31st the Houthis, a Shia militant group that controls large parts of Yemen, launched drones and ballistic missiles at Israel. One was shot down by Israeli missile-defences. The Houthis are keen to show their support for Hamas, but their drones are slow and their missiles inaccurate. One explosive drone aimed at Israel hit Taba, an Egyptian resort town, and injured six people; another landed in Jordan. Though Iran continues to issue near-daily threats, it seems reluctant to unleash its proxies. Raz Zimmt, an Iran-watcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think-tank, notes that some Iranian media outlets have tried to portray Israel’s ground offensive as a failure. This may make it appear as if Hamas can continue the fight without Iranian help. “[It] provides Iran with justification to avoid expanding the conflict,” says Mr Zimmt. In Gaza, though, that conflict will expand. A day after the first strike on Jabalia, Israeli jets bombed the camp again. There will be many more scenes of devastation in what will be a long war. ■ Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/16/will-bibi-break-israel,"This should have been Israel’s moment. As it approaches its 75th birthday in April the risk of a conventional war with neighbouring Arab states, for decades an existential danger, is at its lowest since 1948. The last Palestinian intifada, or uprising against occupation, ended 18 years ago. Israel’s tech-powered economy is more successful and globally relevant than ever. Last year gdp per person hit $55,000, making it richer than the eu. Yet instead of celebrations, Israel faces a crisis. Judicial reforms proposed by the right-wing coalition government would undermine the rule of law and weaken Israeli democracy. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has led Israel for 15 of the past 27 years, prides himself on making ruthless, often ugly, trade-offs that ultimately leave Israel stronger. Now he risks squandering his legacy and leaving Israel less able to cope with the social and geopolitical challenges of the coming decades. The country is in turmoil. On March 11th hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in what may be Israel’s largest-ever protests. Generals, entrepreneurs and scholars warn that democracy is under threat; some 60% of Israelis oppose the legal reforms. Fiery rhetoric from right-wingers, including government ministers, helps fuel violence in the West Bank: so far this year 80 Palestinians have been killed, the highest rate for perhaps two decades. The struggle may escalate further. The Knesset, or parliament, could pass the legislation in the next couple of weeks. There could be a showdown between it and the Supreme Court, forcing citizens and soldiers to make a painful choice about where their loyalties lie. Ehud Barak, a former prime minister and army chief, has called for mass civil disobedience. The reforms are a bad solution to a real problem. Israel has no written constitution. For decades, however, the Supreme Court has asserted that some “basic” laws amount to a quasi-constitution it can enforce, overruling the Knesset. Such activism was not clearly understood to be the aim when these basic laws were passed. The right sees a power grab by a lefty judicial establishment. But Mr Netanyahu, who faces corruption charges and detests the legal elite, is imposing a woeful remedy. His reforms would let the Knesset appoint judges and override the Supreme Court, thus handing virtually unchecked power to a slim majority in the single-chamber legislature. The fight is part of a struggle over Israel’s identity, which has become polarised. A far-right fringe has grown, fuelled by Mr Netanyahu’s demagogic anti-elite politics, inequality and a bigger number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank. The number of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel has grown fast: they are 13% of the population and many study the Torah instead of working or serving in the army. Together, far-right and Orthodox parties won a quarter of Knesset seats in elections last year. With the centre-left parties and Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud unwilling to govern together, he has formed a coalition with them. Moderate Israelis fume that they create the wealth, pay the taxes and fight the wars, in a country that is betraying its liberal roots. Plenty of other states have survived bouts of populist and divisive rule. Yet Israel is unusually vulnerable. One reason is the economy. With $196bn of foreign reserves, Israel is not about to face a financial collapse. But the core of its economy is technology, which generates over half of its exports. This is powered by spending on research and development which, at 5% of gdp annually, is higher than in any other rich country. The experts and entrepreneurs who make this possible do not relish their country being in thrall to religious fanatics, and could emigrate. Israel is also vulnerable because it cannot afford to alienate America, which guarantees its security and supplies 80% of its imported arms. Bipartisan support for Israel among Americans is eroding: a majority of Democrats and people aged 18-29 view it unfavourably. Over 90 members of Congress have written to President Joe Biden, objecting to the legal reforms. Meanwhile Iran has enriched uranium to 84% purity and Britain, France and Germany are warning of “the increasingly severe escalation of its nuclear programme”. Mr Netanyahu has built links with Sunni Arab states, including via the Abraham accords, in order to form an anti-Iran coalition. But last week Saudi Arabia struck a de-escalation deal with Iran, brokered by China. In a dangerous, unstable region, America remains Israel’s indispensable ally. The final vulnerability concerns Israel’s Arab citizens and Palestinians in the West Bank. If minority rights in Israel are weakened, Israeli Arabs, who face discrimination, will grow more disillusioned. And in the West Bank the Supreme Court has to some degree curbed settlements. Weakening the court, even as Israeli ministers openly espouse anti-Arab racism, is incendiary. Mr Netanyahu hopes the Palestinian question can be put on ice for ever. But the Palestinian Authority’s biddable 87-year-old boss may not last much longer, and new militant groups are forming. What is to be done? The legal reforms should be paused. A fitting goal for Israel’s 75th anniversary would be a constitutional convention to strike a balance between the courts and parliament and secure broad consent. Divided countries need stronger institutions and safeguards, not weaker ones. Israel also needs a political realignment so that its parties reflect social change. Some 50-60% of Israeli voters are moderate and together they could command a majority in the Knesset. Broad party realignments have happened before. Mr Netanyahu, an mit-educated, secular pragmatist, is Israel’s most consequential politician of the past 25 years, with a big hand in its economic revival and rapprochement with some Arab states. He surely knows that a more restrained government could run Israel better than this one, which relies on extremists. If he could catalyse a new centrist configuration in Israeli politics he would secure his legacy. Alas, his brand is too toxic and he is too bent on self-preservation. His time has passed. To stop Bibi from breaking Israel, moderates must resist his power grab—and press for a government that puts the Middle East’s only successful liberal democracy on a less dangerous path.■ For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/12/as-israel-fights-on-in-gaza-its-dilemma-gets-worse,"A LARGE SCREEN dominates a tent at the edge of a military base in the Negev Desert. Dozens of blue squares represent Israeli troops on the ground, 20km away, north-east of Gaza city. Inside the headquarters of one of the infantry brigades of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), operations officers co-ordinate search-and-destroy missions of Hamas tunnels from afar. Two weeks after the launch of its ground offensive inside the Gaza Strip, Israel has around four divisions (somewhere around 10,000 troops) in the territory. Some of the columns are making their way into the centre of Gaza city. Others are operating in the outlying towns, which are now mostly empty, going from house to house, searching for more tunnel openings. “This will be our only opportunity to finish off as much of Hamas’s underground network as we can,” says one of the officers, referring to the group’s 500km-long tunnel system. “We don’t know how long we have to operate and we need to make the most of it while we can.” Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Western support for Israel’s campaign is wavering. On November 10th France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, called for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying that, although he supported Israel’s right to respond to Hamas’s terror attack on October 7th, “de facto, there’s babies, there’s ladies, there’s old people bombed and killed. There is no reason for that and no legitimacy.” But Israel’s closest ally, America, has not yet demanded a ceasefire, so the IDF is wasting no time. Israel’s army has, however, reached a point in its campaign where the Israeli government’s stated objectives—to destroy Hamas’s military infrastructure and to rescue the 239 hostages still held in Gaza—are in increasing tension. In recent days much attention has been focused on the hospitals in central Gaza, especially al-Shifa, the biggest. These have become concentrations, not just of the wounded, but also of thousands of civilians who remain in the city, sheltering around them. A doctor at the al-Ahli hospital said that the facility’s blood supply had run out on November 12th, preventing patients from being transfused. Israeli intelligence believes that the hospitals are also where Hamas’s main underground headquarters are situated. Staff at al-Shifa have accused Israel of firing on them and causing the deaths of patients by cutting off the hospital’s electricity. On November 12th the IDF announced that it was opening up an escape-route for civilians out of al-Shifa and two other hospitals, which would get them them to the road leading south of the Israeli perimeter. Israeli officials say that the order to launch a final assault on the hospitals that it says are Hamas’s headquarters has not yet come from the war cabinet led by Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister. But on the same day, Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, while acknowledging “open source information” that pointed to Hamas’s use of hospitals as arms caches and command posts, told CBS News that his country “does not want to see firefights in hospitals, where innocent people, patients receiving medical care, are caught in the crossfire.” The main reason for the cabinet’s reluctance is the hope of reaching an agreement with Hamas on the release of a large number of hostages; Israel is holding out for at least a hundred. In return Israel would free some Palestinian prisoners—it holds 4,450 of them in its jails—and allow more supplies, including fuel, into Gaza. Indirect talks on any kind of deal are ongoing in Qatar and Egypt, but the final word will be that of the head of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, who is Israel’s prime target. It is unclear whether any deal would postpone the IDF’s attempt to destroy any Hamas’s facilities near or below the hospital; it seems unlikely to abandon it. As the tense negotiations continue, Israel is trying to urge as many as possible of the remaining civilians inside Gaza city, who are thought to number around 100,000, to leave for the south as well. But the Israeli government’s refusal to commit to any form of Palestinian control of Gaza after the war is also undermining international support for its campaign. Members of the far-right coalition have been calling for Israel to re-occupy Gaza and rebuild the settlements that Israel dismantled there in 2005. Mr Netanyahu has denied that there are any plans to do so but has also insisted that Israel should retain, post-war, the “overall security control, including the capacity to go in whenever we want to eliminate terrorists who may pop up again”. He has also ruled out a return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which was ousted by Hamas in a coup in 2007, saying it “educates its children to hate Israel, to kill Israelis, to eliminate the State of Israel” and that its president, Mahmoud Abbas, “still has not condemned the terrible massacre 30 days later.” The Biden administration has already made it clear that it wants the PA to control Gaza once the fighting is over—and is working towards such a future. Mr Netanyahu, whose public support has been plummeting, seems more worried about clinging to his shrinking nationalist base than preparing for the enclave’s fate if Hamas is removed from power. Yet in a sign that he may not be in office forever, Israeli officials are already quietly working on plans for Gaza under PA control. ■"
https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-a-reading-list,"Tensions in the Middle East are a political inheritance of the dissolution of the Ottoman empire after the first world war and the piecemeal settlements of 1922. This landmark book, published in 1989 and named as a finalist for the Pulitzer prize, provides a sweeping account of the period between 1914 and 1922, ranging from the Mediterranean to Afghanistan. It astutely traces the Allies’ motivations for carving up the Arab world and shows why the West’s imperial vision was doomed to fail. When, exactly, the Israel-Palestine conflict began is hard to say. Many consider November 2nd 1917 to be the starting-point: that is the date of the Balfour Declaration, when the British government vowed to use its “best endeavours” to create a “national home” for the Jewish people in Palestine, a territory it would take from the Ottomans. This balanced book, praised by Palestinian and Israeli historians alike, offers a tour of the past century of conflict. An eminent Palestinian-American historian explains why Palestinians failed to achieve an independent state. The book is resonant with personal history and lays out the barriers that obstructed Palestinians’ aspirations. It counts the poor decision-making of certain Palestinian leaders among its explanations, too. The militant organisation that rules the Gaza Strip first emerged in 1987 during the first Palestinian intifada (“shaking off”, or uprising). In its first charter Hamas styled itself as the “Islamic Resistance Movement” and declared Israel illegitimate. In 2006 Hamas became the first Islamist movement to ascend to power in the Middle East by winning an election. The authors interviewed hundreds of people over three decades, including the group’s leaders, fighters, opponents and victims. This book explains the inception of the “largest, most influential and most deadly Islamist organisation” and how it became entrenched in Gaza. The right first came to power in Israel nearly five decades ago, but its current government may be the most right-wing in the country’s 75-year history. This richly detailed book analyses with clarity and insight the political and philosophical ideas that drive the right. The author, who is a professor at Cambridge, studies important thinkers and figures such as Ze’ev Jabotinsky (the founder of the Zionist Right) and Binyamin Netanyahu (Israel’s prime minister). In 2000 the author, a British doctor, accompanied her husband, a UN official, and three small children to Israel. A month later the second Palestinian intifada erupted. This moving memoir—which spans three years—documents the events she witnessed. She gave birth to a fourth child in a hospital in Bethlehem, which was shelled by the Israeli army. A Palestinian suicide-bomber blew himself up near her children’s school, with his head landing at the foot of their teacher. The Economist’s journalists have also written books about the conflict. Anton La Guardia, our diplomatic editor, is the author of “Holy Land, Unholy War: Israelis and Palestinians”. Nicolas Pelham, a Middle East correspondent, wrote “Holy Lands: Reviving Pluralism in the Middle East”; Gregg Carlstrom, also a Middle East correspondent, wrote “How Long Will Israel Survive?: The Threat From Within”. Anshel Pfeffer, our Israel correspondent, is the author of “Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu”. ■ For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"
https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/26/israels-war-economy-is-working-for-the-time-being,"Less than three weeks since Hamas plunged Israel into war, conflict is taking a toll on the country’s economy. The shekel has sunk to its lowest level against the dollar in more than a decade, prompting Israel’s central bank to sell $30bn of foreign-exchange reserves to prop up the currency. The price of insuring the country’s debt against default has rocketed. Firms from builders to restaurants have shut. On October 19th the finance ministry outlined plans to ramp up defence spending and provide for those pushed out of work. Four days later the central bank cut its growth forecast for the year from 3% to 2.3%. Since war is not just fought by military forces, but also by economic ones, an important question hovers over all this activity. Can Israel withstand the economic pain? The country’s clashes with Hamas since withdrawing from Gaza in 2005 do not provide much of a guide. In each case billions of shekels—a mere fraction of gdp—were spent on the military and repairs. The conflicts did not pose a threat to the country’s economy, which has long had one of the highest incomes per person in the Middle East. The scale of Hamas’s attacks on October 7th, and the likely ensuing conflict, is therefore pushing economists to the history books. In 1973 the cost of weapons and drafting 200,000 army reservists for the Yom Kippur war brought Israel to the brink of financial collapse. The country’s central bank reckons that, in 2002, a single year of intifada (Palestinian uprisings that ran intermittently from the late 1980s to the 2000s) cost 3.8% of gdp. To dodge disaster, Israeli officials must face up to three challenges. The first is employment. There are not enough workers to support both the economy and the war. Since October 7th the armed forces have mobilised more than 360,000 reservists, or 8% of the country’s workforce—a bigger call-up than in 1973. Most have left jobs, producing an enormous hole in the economy. Worse, the recruits are some of Israel’s most productive workers. Start-Up Nation, an Israeli charity, reckons that a tenth of tech workers have been called up. Workers in the industry are a quarter more productive than the average in the oecd club of mostly rich countries. By contrast, those in the rest of the economy are two-fifths less productive. Just a handful of reservists are from ultra-Orthodox communities in which employment is shunned. There is another source of labour shortages. Many of Israel’s low-skilled jobs are done by Palestinians from the West Bank, some 200,000 of whom work in either Israel or its settlements. But unrest in the West Bank means that many workers are not being allowed across the border, and they may begin to strike. During part of the second Palestinian intifada, which lasted from 2000 to 2005, missing Palestinian workers were one of the biggest brakes on Israeli growth, according to the imf. Moreover, there are few workers with which to replace reservists and Palestinians, since Israel’s labour market is ultra-tight. According to the central bank, which has spent the past few months raising interest rates to cool the economy, unemployment is at 3.2%. Strict labour laws mean that firms can only hire temporary replacements for those on military duty—not an attractive option. Investors worry about capital flooding away from “Silicon Wadi” and back to its Californian namesake. Start-Up Nation reckons that 70% of tech firms are struggling to function. The risk is that, when the war finishes, there will be fewer jobs to which to return. A second challenge for policymakers is the collapse of private consumption. Amid uncertainty and fear of repeat attacks, people have changed their consumption habits by staying at home. For nearly three weeks, restaurants and shopping malls have been empty. Those with the workers to open have discovered there are few customers. Tourism, Israel’s main business aside from tech, has screeched to a halt. Entire towns along the border with Gaza and Lebanon have been cleared out, putting a stop to economic activity. In order to support firms, all but the biggest businesses that suffer because of the war will receive covid-style grants to cover fixed costs. vat payments have been deferred. Workers who used to toil in areas now deemed unsafe will get handouts. That brings the final challenge for Israeli policymakers: managing the fiscal costs of conflict. Rescuing businesses, paying reservists and housing the population of entire villages in hotels will take its toll. An enormous increase in defence spending will be required in order to finance a ground invasion this year, and stock Israel with enough weapons to feel secure next year. Israel’s debt is currently at around 60% of gdp, a modest ratio for somewhere so rich. Even assuming that the war continues to the end of the year, it is forecast to rise to a mere 62%. The central bank has a healthy $170bn of foreign-exchange reserves. On top of this, America will help, assuming that President Joe Biden is able to unlock the $14bn he is asking for in military aid from Congress. Yet the longer the conflict continues, the more risks will grow. In 2024 Israel’s primary deficit is forecast to jump from 3% of gdp to 8%. The country’s economy had been on the rocks before Hamas’s attack. The government’s revenues were down by 8% in September, after a tough first eight months of the year. Now the cost of borrowing is rising and the tax base is crumbling. A longer war will mean more destruction, and reconstruction will not come cheap. The government will not be able to pay its way for ever, which is one reason why a chorus of local politicians insists that a ground invasion of Gaza ought to proceed straight away. Although, in the next few months, households and firms will receive generous financial support, conflict is draining labour, capital and expertise from Israel’s economy faster than it can be replaced. Other economies may have withstood far greater damage in pursuit of military victories in the past, but that will be little consolation to those forced to bear the costs in Israel this time around. ■ Read more from Free exchange, our column on economics:Do Amazon and Google lock out competition?

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/09/hamass-attack-was-an-israeli-intelligence-failure-on-multiple-fronts,"THE VICIOUS success of Hamas’s attack on Israel, without their plans being unveiled, is matched by the astounding failure of Israeli intelligence at every level. The assault by land, sea and air on October 7th left at least 800 dead in Israel, and must have required months of planning. Officials are in shock that such a significant military buildup by the Islamist movement that controls Gaza escaped their notice. That will surely be the subject of multiple investigations once the fighting in Gaza is over. But it is already clear that the failures came in two forms: one of intelligence-collecting and the other of assessing and interpreting that intelligence. First, Israel was let down by its extensive array of electronic sensors, surveillance systems and old-fashioned human intelligence in the form of agents on the ground. These are all the responsibility of the army’s intelligence branch and Shin Bet, the domestic security service which is tasked with covering Gaza and the West Bank. Read more on this story: Second, the information that they did manage to collect which now, with hindsight, could have pointed to an impending attack, was misinterpreted or ignored leading to the wrong assessment of Hamas’s intentions. It is a failure which resonates with Israelis 50 years after the Yom Kippur War. That began with an attack by the Egyptian and Syrian armies that caught Israel’s intelligence agencies and armed forces unawares and which is still to this day called “the failure” by Israelis. In that assault, too, crucial intelligence was misinterpreted. The first may be explained by what was evidently a high level of operational security by Hamas. Those who knew about the operation in advance would have been limited to an extremely tight circle of senior operatives who did not risk using phones or any other form of electronic communication that Israel would have intercepted given that it monitors all communications in Gaza. The Hamas foot soldiers who were sent on the mission would have probably been given only a few hours’ notice, and told to arrive with their weapons at a point near the border, without being given any further details. Some may have been surprised that they succeeded in penetrating, in some places, as much as 30km into Israel, or that the incursion would continue for days. But in the past Israel has succeeded in foiling similar plans. This time around, they failed. There are some mitigating factors, especially at the level of field intelligence. The conscripts and junior officers monitoring the network of cameras and sensors that cover every inch of the border area can identify individual Hamas members on their screens. But the sight of them walking near the border, even in large numbers, would not necessarily have struck those watching the area as odd. Hamas’s military wing is built around regional brigades and battalions. Its members operate in their local neighbourhoods. The entire coastal enclave is just 360 square kilometres and the distance between the border with Israel to the east and the Mediterranean coast in the west is at some points as little as ten kilometres. Many of the attackers on the border fence would have been within walking-distance of their homes and expected to be in that area. Neither would the presence of bulldozers on building sites near the border have aroused suspicion. And the attack employed civilian vehicles, such as pick-up trucks, that would have passed unnoticed. Hamas also mounted what looks like a textbook military operation. It began its assault with a careful attack against Israel’s sensors and communications. Many of Israel’s surveillance cameras were targeted by snipers and disabled. Electronic warfare appears to have been involved, too. A commando attack on the Israel Defence Forces’ southern Gaza headquarters jammed its communications and prevented commanders from issuing an alert, according to a report by Reuters, a news agency. Militants breached the formidable security barrier around Gaza, which has a strip of no-man’s land in front of it and is festooned with cameras, heat-sensors and automatic machine-gun positions, at 29 separate locations, mainly using civilian bulldozers. Dozens of vehicles and hundreds of gunmen (by one assessment as many as a thousand) streamed through the holes in the fence. The attack also made use of what military types call combined-arms warfare: a massive rocket salvo at dawn provided cover for the ground advance, which was backed up by fighters using powered gliders and others who arrived by sea. None of this excuses the failure to detect for months the planning and procurement of weapons. But the most serious failure is at the highest level of political assessment. Since the 11-day war between Israel and Gaza in May 2021, Israeli intelligence officials had assumed that Hamas has been deterred from provoking another war and that its leader in Gaza, Yihya Sinwar, had decided to focus on rebuilding the beleaguered strip’s economy. For that he would need Israel and Egypt, who have maintained the closure of Gaza since the Hamas coup in 2007, to allow day-labourers and traders across the border. That remained their assessment until Saturday morning. It is a failure of the Israeli political leadership as well. No country has unlimited intelligence resources. Their allocation—the intelligence-targeting—is to a large degree determined by politicians’ priorities. Israeli securocrats have long complained that Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has neglected the Gaza threat, preferring to focus on Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hizbullah. American and Israeli officials say that there is no evidence of an Iranian hand in the attacks. Ministers in his current hard-right government, formed at the end of 2022, have demanded more resources for policing the occupied West Bank, where their supporters, Israeli settlers, live among mostly Palestinians. Mr Netanyahu has presented himself throughout his career as an expert on terrorism. Indeed this was his early claim to fame in the American media. But in this case he seems to have taken his eye off the ball. Hamas’s success and Israel’s intelligence failure is likely to be studied closely by armed forces around the world. In recent years, military thinkers have argued that persistent sensors and precision weapons have made it progressively harder for armies to go on the offensive, because concentrated forces tend to get spotted and hit. That trend has forced Ukraine, for instance, to forgo large-scale armoured counter-offensives in favour of smaller assaults by small teams of soldiers on foot. Hamas’s raid shows two things. One is that large-scale infiltration remains possible, even in the face of some of the world’s most advanced surveillance technology, if an attacker is diligent and a defender complacent. That is a lesson for countries that face reckless foes across long land borders—the Baltic states or South Korea, for instance. The other is that Hamas remains a dangerous “hybrid” actor—neither an old-fashioned terrorist group nor a conventional army, but, like Hizbullah, a highly capable armed force that blends elements of both. After this latest war, however it ends, there will be no shortage of culprits to blame for Israel taking its eye off Gaza. “Heads will roll once this is over,” predicted one official. The biggest, he continued, should not be spared. Mr Netanyahu will be only too aware of how the failures of 1973 fatally undermined the then prime minister, Golda Meir, and led to her resignation.■"
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/16/israels-tank-commanders-are-studying-russias-mistakes,"LIKE EVERY modern army, Israel’s generals have been watching the battles in Ukraine over the past year and a half closely and taking notes. Now that the tank battalions of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) are poised to enter Gaza in force, following the terror attack on Israeli communities on October 7th in which more than 1,400 were murdered, those lessons are particularly relevant. Tanks, though increasingly vulnerable to drones, loitering munitions and modern anti-tank guided missiles, which strike from the top, remain the only platform on the battlefield combining mobility, protection and serious firepower. They will form the vanguard of Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza, blasting a path for the infantry units behind them. “We saw how the Russians fought in Ukraine and the mistakes they made,” says Brigadier General Hisham Ibrahim, commander of the IDF’s Armoured Corps, who has the job of preparing Israel’s tanks and their crews for war. “They fought there in a single-corps fashion, instead of using combined arms tactics,” he explains. In other words, Russia’s armoured regiments operated as separate tank units instead of working in integrated formations with infantry, combat-engineering and artillery units, and without co-ordination with intelligence and air power. In some cases, tank columns were sent single-file down a road without any support, leaving them to be picked off by Ukrainians. Russian tank crews were poorly trained and showed little sign of following their own doctrine. “Israel’s armoured corps has a different shape than it used to,” says General Ibrahim. “We have been training in a combined-arms fashion at all levels for some years now. We no longer see the tank as being capable of doing everything. The battlefield has changed; it’s much more crowded and built-up. There are many challenges to these big platforms and I expect the infantry and engineers to make up for my disadvantages. Our soldiers in all the courses and exercises are now accustomed to fighting in a combined-arms environment.” Many of these ideas were originally learned from Israel’s large-scale tank battles during the Yom Kippur war, 50 years ago. During that conflict the IDF’s armoured battalions, sometimes operating on their own, took major losses from Egypt’s then-novel Sagger anti-tank missiles, supplied by the Soviet Union, as well as from opposing tanks. The IDF quickly adapted, and its tactics were widely studied and adopted by the US Army in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, Israeli tank crews are widely seen as being among the best trained and prepared in the world. But the IDF is not alone in having learned from Ukraine. At the start of Hamas’s assault on the Israeli border, the attackers used drones carrying large grenades to take out observation posts. In one case at least, there is footage of such a grenade hitting an Israeli Merkava tank. Similar tactics have been used by the Ukrainians against Russian tanks. General Ibrahim insists that while some of the tanks on the border were hit “two or three times”, none was destroyed and all will be back in action shortly. Nevertheless, in some of the staging areas, Merkava tanks have been seen with “cope cages”, slatted metal barriers fixed over the turret, the most exposed part of the vehicle, to block such attacks from above. Russia’s resort to such improvised devices provoked sniggering last year, but Israel’s adoption suggests that armour professionals take the threat from drones increasingly seriously. The more advanced version of the Merkava used by the IDF’s regular armoured brigades, as opposed to those crewed by reservists, is equipped with the TROPHY, an extremely sophisticated Israeli-designed “active protection system” system which has proven effective at defeating incoming anti-tank missiles with explosive panels that blow outwards. Not all of the tank units have the system, however. And every tank, including earlier versions of the Merkava, in Israel’s storage depots is now being deployed, suggesting the large scale of the operation to come and the need to guard Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Within two hours of the start of the Hamas attack, General Ibrahim had notified all the IDF’s armoured-brigade commanders that they should start mobilising, even before the official order had arrived from the army bosses. Now, for the first time in over four decades, since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the entire armoured corps has been called up. This is a massive force, and although the IDF, keen to protect its operational security, is not giving out numbers, it is understood to include over 1,000 main battle tanks. Many of these are not intended for the ground offensive in Gaza, but are being positioned in northern Israel for the possibility of war flaring up also with Hizbullah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese movement, which has been provoking an Israeli response with daily rocket and mortar shelling since the Hamas attack on October 7th. If a second front does erupt, Israeli tank-crews will be fighting two types of war. While both Hamas and Hizbullah have used similar tactics and weaponry in previous encounters with Israeli tanks—small ambush teams firing Russian-made (and Iranian-supplied) anti-tank missiles—the terrain will make a lot of difference. Facing Hizbullah in the hilly, woodland areas of the Galilee and southern Lebanon is a very different prospect from fighting in densely built-up urban areas of Gaza City, where attacks can come from close quarters. For many years, the consensus among military experts was that fighting with lumbering tanks in narrow city streets was a liability. But the more informed view is that if used properly, and in conjunction with other ground forces, nothing can replace the tank’s firepower and breaching capabilities when fighting in an urban environment defended by heavily armed opponents. American commanders say that tanks proved vital in key urban battles in the Iraq war, including situations where lighter armoured vehicles proved inadequate. In Sadr City, a hostile suburb of Baghdad, American tanks and other armour formed what one study calls “roving, armoured boxes” which could move slowly, steadily and safely without exposing dismounted troops to danger. Israel’s tank corps has at least two advantages over many other tank operators. One is that Hamas is not thought to possess “top-attack” anti-tank missiles like the American Javelin and Anglo-Swedish NLAW, supplied to Ukraine, which strike a tank at the weakest part of its armour—the top of the hull. The other is that Israeli tanks are designed to fight on the country’s borders, rather than far from home, and to give high levels of protection. That makes them relatively bulky and heavy, and potentially less mobile, but capable of withstanding serious hits. In addition to their “active” protection, the more advanced Israeli tanks and infantry fighting vehicles also have sophisticated communications systems. These connect them to a network which supplies troops, on screens in the tank, with all the information being collected by sensors on other Israeli platforms, including footage from drones hovering overhead. “Today’s tank can use information collected from other sources to fire on its targets and collect information itself which will be used by other sources of fire,” says General Ibrahim. That overcomes the traditional problem of urban warfare: short lines of sight, in which one tank platoon may have little idea of what is going on around the next block. Like tank generals the world around, he deeply disagrees with those who inferred from Russia’s failures that the day of the tank was over, and cites the events of October 7th as proof. As thousands of fighters were charging into Israel through 29 breaches along the border fence, he argues that at some points, the small number of tanks stationed that morning on the border “were the only remaining layer of protection, and they were using all their weapons, cannon, machineguns and simply running over, to try and stop hundreds of terrorists around them who were trying to get into the communities.” With most of the observation and cameras on the border knocked out, the tanks were often carrying the only surveillance systems still operating to pass along vital information. Ultimately the IDF’s failure that morning was one of intelligence assessment and a lack of forces within quick reach of the border. But of the few tanks which were there and made it to the kibbutzim, General Ibrahim insists “they were the key element in restoring control to those communities and ending the bloodshed. Nothing could have done that like a tank.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/26/israel-has-lurched-closer-to-constitutional-chaos,"Tisha b’av is the saddest day in the Jewish calendar. A time of mourning and fasting, it marks the destruction of the first and second temples in Jerusalem—the result, in part, of infighting among the Jewish people. This year the commemoration began on July 26th, two days after Israel’s government passed a law aimed at dramatically weakening the country’s Supreme Court. The reform’s many opponents see it as an act of self-destruction. The echo of Tisha B’Av only deepened their sorrow. The vote on July 24th means that the Supreme Court will no longer be able to overturn government decisions on the ground of “reasonableness”, which critics had seen as a blank cheque for judicial meddling. It has prompted a furious reaction among many Israelis. The opposition boycotted the final vote. Israelis once again flooded into the streets to protest. Trade unions are talking about a general strike. Thousands of army reservists have vowed not to turn up for duty. The day after the vote Morgan Stanley downgraded Israeli sovereign debt. In a striking criticism, America, Israel’s closest ally, described the government’s move as “unfortunate”. The outrage reflects—and has deepened—the divisions within Israel over the most fundamental questions surrounding the country’s democratic and Jewish character. If infighting is not to threaten the Jewish state once again, politicians from all sides need to step back from the brink and search for a constitutional reform that commands broad support. Whether or not Binyamin Netanyahu wished it, the judicial reforms have become his defining policy. The prime minister had delayed a vote in March to give time for compromise, but talks went nowhere. Even as he waited to vote in the Knesset this week, he tried in vain to persuade his allies to delay once again. Instead his coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties forced through the reform. Just a day out of hospital for heart surgery, Mr Netanyahu looked exhausted. He faces charges of corruption that Supreme Court reform may help dismiss. By caving in to his far-right partners’ threats to resign, he has made clear that he puts his own political survival above all else. He has thus given the extremists the upper hand. Even the government’s fiercest critics agree that Israel’s judicial system needs reform. Many would place limits on use of the reasonableness standard, without abolishing it altogether. The committee that appoints judges has a majority of sitting justices and Bar Association representatives, leaving politicians in a minority. Because the right feels the court no longer reflects the country’s views, the idea that it is self-perpetuating is harmful. However, the way the government has rammed through its changes has fed fears that the far-right means to clear any legal obstacles to its efforts to transform Israel, whether by changing the status of religion or by annexing parts of the Palestinians’ West Bank. After the vote, Yariv Levin, the hardline justice minister, declared that this was merely the first step in the coalition’s plans. Some worry that the government wants legislation that would skew the electoral system to make conservative victories more likely. Because the Knesset has only one chamber, Israel risks falling into majoritarian rule—a particular threat to secular Jews and minorities, including Israeli Arabs. The Knesset is about to go into its summer recess. That gives two months to find a way to heal a divided country. Although Mr Netanyahu is concerned with his own political survival, he must realise that if the cost is ramming through the judicial reform, he will pay with his legacy. If he does not want to be remembered as the prime minister who weakened Israeli democracy, he needs to build consensus. If he cannot find that among politicians, he should establish a broad and inclusive constitutional convention that would codify the powers of parliament and the courts. And if Mr Netanyahu fails? The task will fall to the Supreme Court. It has said it will hold off from hearing appeals against the law until September. If the coalition is determined to pursue the reforms to their full extent the court should strike down the law. It faces a terrible choice. As the first court to reject part of one of Israel’s basic laws, which is in effect the country’s stand-in constitution, the court would seem to be vindicating those who say it is out of control. But failing to do so would leave all of Israel’s institutions in peril. Striking down the law would bring Israel’s constitutional crisis to a head. But that would force the country’s leaders to deal explicitly with how to preserve democracy. Israel’s founders failed to write a constitution because they could not agree on principles such as its relationship with the Palestinians and the role of religion. It has muddled through for 75 years. If the temple is not strengthened, it may start to crumble. ■"
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/17/hamas-tunnels-under-gaza-will-be-a-key-battlefield-for-israel,"STUDENTS OF urban warfare divide the battlefield into four planes. One is the sky above cities, increasingly thick with drones. Next are the buildings that extend upwards, offering vantage points and hiding places. A third is the streetscape: the lattice of roads, alleys and paths that form a city’s peacetime arteries. It is the fourth—the tunnels lying beneath—that will present the greatest challenge to the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) when they begin their invasion of the Gaza Strip in the coming days. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas The first smuggling tunnels in the area were built by Bedouin clans on both sides of the Egypt-Gaza border after 1981, when Israel and Egypt demarcated the border. The first known tunnel attack from the strip occurred in 1989. But it was in 2001 that Hamas, the militant group that would later take over the territory, after Israel withdrew in 2005, began construction of a remarkable subterranean network. Its initial aim was to smuggle in material and arms from Egypt. But the tunnels had manifold other uses. Commanders could hide in them and use them to communicate without relying on Gaza’s phone network, tapped by Israel. They provided hiding places for weapons and ammunition. Hamas could use them for ambushes during Israeli ground wars in Gaza. And they allowed cross-border raids into Israel for attacks and abductions—such as the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit in 2006, a raid that later helped Hamas secure the release of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hizbullah, the Lebanese militant group, built similar tunnels on the Israel-Lebanon border, though most were destroyed in 2018-19. The military rationale of such tunnels was ultimately to erode Israel’s way of war. “In 2008”, said a Hamas commander, reflecting on a brief but intense war over Gaza that winter, “the air strike and air surveillance [by Israel] took us by surprise…so we made strategic plans to move the battle from the surface to underground.” By 2014 the group’s tunnelling effort employed 900 full-time staff, with each tunnel taking three months and an average of $100,000 to build, according to a study by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank. Hamas raised capital for the tunnels, pitching them as commercial investment schemes, complete with contracts drafted by lawyers, through mosques in Gaza. Iran and North Korea are thought to have helped with construction, supplying money and engineers. In 2014 the IDF launched Operation Protective Edge, an air and ground war targeting the tunnels. It destroyed around 32 of them, stretching for 100km in total, 14 of which penetrated Israeli territory. That was a tiny fraction of the whole network, which was thought to number 1,300 tunnels extending, according to Hamas, 500km in all—more than ten times the length of Gaza itself. A commission of inquiry after the war found that the IDF was unprepared for the danger presented by the tunnels, despite having warned the country’s political leadership that they presented one of the five most serious threats to the state. Israel’s defence minister at the time boasted that it would take just a few days for the IDF to destroy the tunnels it had targeted; it took weeks. Locating tunnels proved extremely difficult. “We were familiar with the tunnels mainly in theory,” noted General Nadav Padan, who commanded a division in 2014. “We did not have operational experience.” (General Padan, since retired in New York, returned to Israel on October 8th to rejoin the IDF.) The IDF used “geophones”, as well as ground-penetrating radar, which turn ground vibrations into voltage, and detection of echoes from controlled explosions, a technique honed in the oil industry. But many tunnels were discovered thanks to human intelligence—sources inside Gaza—or infantry patrols that happened to find the entrances. Israeli signals-intelligence units also looked for occasions when Palestinian phone signals would suddenly disappear. Even when a tunnel was found, destroying it was another matter. Israel’s air force attempted to drop precision bombs along the tunnel’s route, a practice dubbed “kinetic drilling”, but some failed to detonate at the right depth. The IDF also used “Emulsa”, a gel-like explosive, but each tunnel required nine  to 11 tonnes of the stuff on average, notes RAND, with ground troops forced to secure entrances for long periods. Units often had to improvise; some borrowed trolleys and agricultural equipment from Israeli border villages to shuttle explosives into Gaza. In the past, IDF personnel generally sought to avoid fighting in tunnels, many of which were booby-trapped. The army’s high command barred troops from entering them unless one end had been blown up or secured; this order was disregarded only once, in 2014, when an Israeli officer’s body was snatched into a tunnel in Rafah, Gaza’s southern crossing with Egypt. The prohibition made sense. In many ways, subterranean warfare epitomises the trickiest aspects of urban warfare. Cities involve limited lines of sight, close-quarters battle and poor communications, with radio signals travelling poorly between tall buildings. Tunnels exacerbate all those things. Even the most sophisticated drones cannot see underground. Navigating by GPS is impossible. Radio signals for communication do not penetrate far. The experience of British soldiers involved in a recent tunnel exercise in Leeds, a northern city in England, highlighted the challenges that IDF soldiers are likely to face. The total darkness made night-vision goggles all but useless, for instance, since such devices rely on amplifying the faint ambient light that is present above ground even at night. Disturbing stagnant water risks releasing toxic gases into the air. The air is colder than above ground by as much as ten degrees Celsius. “You realise that unless you are properly drilled, and have spent a long time down there, you’re not moving fast,” noted one British soldier in the Leeds exercise. The sound of weapons fire is also amplified in an enclosed space, observes Joe Vega, the US Army’s top expert on underground warfare. That, he says, is why larger teams are needed to clear tunnels, “because you have to continually replace people in and out—they just can’t last.” The effect, known as overpressure, also causes weapons fire to kick up dust and dirt, reducing visibility. The techniques once used to clear tunnels—America used tear gas in Vietnam; the Soviets a variety of chemical agents in Afghanistan—“would likely be regarded as unlawful today”, says Daphné Richemond-Barak in “Underground Warfare”, a book on the topic. (Despite its frequent use against domestic protesters, tear gas is largely illegal in war.) The IDF increasingly relies on technology to help. It has remote-controlled ground robots, for instance, which can look for booby traps or ambushes lying in wait. “To enter a tunnel after a robot has combed through it…makes the situation a lot less stressful,” says a soldier from the IDF’s elite Samur (weasel in Hebrew) tunnelling unit, quoted in a recent study. “It lowers the tension and the environment becomes much more sterile.” But tech is unreliable. “More than once a soldier was operating a robot that got stuck inside a tunnel,” complained another officer. “Now try and go in and retrieve a robot that is 400 metres inside a tunnel complex. It’s like running 150 metres where each metre is like crossing a desert for a month.” In the nine years since Operation Protective Edge, the IDF has invested heavily in tunnel operations; it has introduced new doctrine, techniques and specialised units. It has constructed its own version of Hamas tunnels for training. Its Yahalom battalion, an elite combat engineering unit, which includes Samur, was reorganised, notes Omer Dostri of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy & Security, a think-tank, with its size doubled from 400 to 900 personnel and new tunnel reconnaissance units attached to the IDF’s Gaza division. It faces a forbidding task. On October 16th Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, the IDF’s chief of staff, promised “to enter Gaza, to go to the places where Hamas is preparing, acting, planning, launching” and to “attack them everywhere, every commander, every operative, destroy infrastructure.” In practice, identifying, clearing and collapsing several hundred kilometres of underground warrens will be the work of years—not weeks or months. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/19/the-stakes-could-hardly-be-higher-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict,"How rapidly things fall apart. The deadly blast in Gaza at Ahli Arab hospital on the evening of October 17th killed many Palestinians who were taking shelter. Despite strong evidence that their deaths were caused by the failure of a Palestinian rocket laden with fuel, Arab countries rushed to condemn Israel. Hizbullah, a heavily armed Lebanese militia, is lurching closer to outright war with Israel. Bridges built painstakingly between Israel and its Arab neighbours lie in ruins. How fragile are the forces trying to hold things together. Fifteen hours after the blast, President Joe Biden landed in Israel, an old man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Mr Biden’s diplomacy is a geopolitical moment. As well as signalling grief and support for Israel, it brings into focus how much this crisis matters to the Middle East and to America . For the past half-century the United States has been the only country willing and able to bring any kind of order to the region. Regardless of the many failures of American policy there, including in Iraq and Syria, Mr Biden and his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, have once again taken up that burden. Death and disease hang over Gaza. The poison is spreading across the Arab world. They do not have long. The imminent danger is on that second front in the north of Israel. The death toll at Ahli Arab means that Hizbullah and its Iranian sponsors risk losing face if they fail to avenge lost Palestinian lives. Hizbullah will now also have strong backing in the Arab world if it attacks. If Israel concludes war is inevitable, it may strike first. America has tasked two aircraft-carriers with deterring Hizbullah and Iran from opening a second front. If they defy it, it should use them for a show of force. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas A second danger is of Arab-Israeli relations being put back decades. Amid Israel’s unprecedented bombing, Arabs remember previous wars in which Israel hit schools and hospitals. Israel has imposed a total siege of Gaza; its president has said all Gazans share responsibility. Despite Israel’s excesses, Arab leaders could have called for calm and for an independent investigation of the hospital blast. What looks like the mass killing of Palestinians by Palestinians ought to have redoubled their efforts to safeguard Gaza’s civilians and spurred them on to create a regional plan for a better Palestinian future. Instead, the blast has deepened hatred and grievances. In words that cannot easily be taken back, Israel’s Arab partners heaped blame upon the Jewish state. Jordan immediately cancelled a summit between Mr Biden and Arab leaders that had been the best hope for regional diplomacy. Egypt is more resolved than ever to keep temporary refugees out of the Sinai, partly for fear of being seen to abet Israel in what Palestinians worry is a plan to empty Gaza permanently. This is a lamentable failure of leadership, with profound regional and global implications. Most Arab governments loathe Hamas and its backer, Iran. Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia need stability and benefit from good relations with Israel. However, they are so wary of testing their citizens’ anger with the truth about the rocket’s origin that they have chosen to sabotage their people’s long-term interests. For Iran, that looks like victory. For years it has had a strategy of financing, arming and training proxies like Hamas and Hizbullah. It calculates that violence and mayhem weaken Israel and discredit Arab governments. If the sight of America fighting Hizbullah alongside Israel leads to a rupture of Mr Biden’s relations with the Arab world, an exultant Iran will have built the foundations for its own regional dominance. Russia and China are winning, too. There is a perception in the global south that this complex story is actually a simple one of oppressed Palestinians and Israeli colonisers. China and Russia will exploit this caricature to argue that America is revealing its true contempt for brown-skinned people in Gaza and its hypocrisy over human rights and war crimes—just as they claim it did by supposedly provoking a war in Ukraine. What can Mr Biden do? His analysis must start with the need for peace between the Palestinians and Israelis and a recognition that there can be none for as long as Hamas governs Gaza—not after it has demonstrated that it puts Jew-hatred before any other goal. Gaza City is honeycombed by tunnels. Destroying Hamas’s ability to wage war therefore requires a ground offensive. Everything follows from the prosecution of that ground war. The tragedy of Ahli Arab validates the cynical calculation that Palestinian casualties help Hamas by undermining support for Israel. The Israeli army needs to be seen to spare civilians, not least because it needs time to destroy Hamas’s tunnels. Gaza is on the brink. Poor sanitation threatens epidemic disease. Israel has at last agreed that some aid can cross into Gaza. Much more will be needed. If Egypt continues to bar refugees, Israel should go further by creating havens on its own territory in the Negev, supervised by UN agencies. It is also vital to spell out what comes after the invasion. Israel needs to show that its fight is with the terrorists, not the people of Gaza. It should pledge a new beginning after the war, with a programme of rebuilding and the promise that it will not strangle Gaza’s economy. It should support a new Palestinian constitution and new elected leaders. All this would be easier under a new Israeli government voted in when the war is done. Even if Mr Biden can persuade Israel to take these steps, that leaves the hardest question of all. How to provide security in post-Hamas Gaza? Israel cannot occupy the enclave permanently. That idea was rightly abandoned in 2005. An international commitment is therefore needed. Because it is not clear who would join this, Mr Biden should start building a coalition now. The more Israel shows the Arab world that it is serious about protecting civilians and planning for the day after, the more likely Arab leaders are to play their part. This is a tall order. Much can and will go wrong. Ordinary Arabs’ ingrained anti-Zionism will gnaw at their leaders’ willingness to help. But the alternative is the decay that feeds scavenger states like Iran and Russia. Mr Biden is the only leader who can pull things back together. If he fails, and the security of the Middle East crumbles, it will be a catastrophe for America, too. ■ For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/07/who-is-herzi-halevi-the-chief-of-staff-of-the-israel-defence-forces,"EVEN BEFORE Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, attacked Israel on October 7th, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi was in a difficult position. In January 2023, when he became chief of general staff of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), the most senior position in Israel’s army, the officer and reserve corps were rent by divisions over proposed reforms to the country’s Supreme Court. Some reservists threatened not to serve if the divisive prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and his far-right coalition passed laws weakening the powers of the court. It was one of the army’s most turbulent periods in recent times. Hamas’s murder of 1,400 Israelis, and capture of more than 200 hostages, eclipsed all that. General Halevi is now commanding an aerial and ground offensive against the militant group in Gaza, in which more than 10,000 Palestinians have died, according to the enclave’s health ministry. Popular rage at the way Israel is conducting the war has inspired protests in many countries. The UN human-rights office says that Israel may have committed a war crime when it struck the Jabalia refugee camp. A minister in the Netanyahu government raised the possibility of using nuclear weapons against Gaza (he was suspended for his remarks). But in General Halevi Israel has a commander with a strong reputation for upholding legal and ethical standards in the conduct of warfare. What is his background and how might it influence how he prosecutes the war? He was born in 1967 in Jerusalem and named after his uncle, who had been killed in action a few months earlier in the Six Day War. His mother’s family had lived in the city for 14 generations; his paternal grandparents emigrated from Russia. His father’s father was a member of Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary group active in the years leading up to the establishment of Israel. The general began his regular army service at the age of 18, as a paratrooper, and started training to be an officer two years later. During the early years of his career he skirmished with Hizbullah, a Shia militant group in southern Lebanon that is now exchanging shellfire with Israel, and joined Sayeret Matkal, a special-forces unit that conducts secret operations deep in Arab countries, which he eventually commanded. He next headed a brigade in the occupied West Bank. In 2009, he led paratroopers in Gaza, in a ground offensive in the towns north of Gaza city where the IDF is fighting once again. As commander of the Galilee Division from 2011 General Halevi led the IDF on the border with Lebanon. He became head of military intelligence in 2014 and of the Southern Command from 2018, with responsibility for deterring Hamas. It was after his experience in the Gaza war of 2008-09, in which hundreds of Palestinian civilians died, that he became an outspoken advocate of the legal and ethical conduct of warfare. In a lecture in 2009 he criticised other Israeli field commanders for failing to set “moral standards” for soldiers fighting in urban areas with many civilians present. “A soldier cannot go into battle with a law book,” he said, but commanders have a responsibility to ensure that moral and legal standards are upheld. General Halevi’s views belong to an Israeli military tradition. Yitzhak Sadeh, a leader of the Haganah, a Zionist militia that was the forerunner of the IDF, coined the term “purity of arms” and warned fighters against acts of wanton retribution. But the IDF also had commanders who ignored such principles. As a young commando officer in 1953 Ariel Sharon, who was prime minister between 2001 and 2006, led a reprisal in Qibya, a village in the West Bank, then controlled by Jordan, that killed 69 Palestinians. Three decades later an Israeli commission found that Sharon, then defence minister, had not acted to prevent the massacre by Israel’s allies of Palestinians in refugee camps in Lebanon. General Halevi is leading the IDF at a time when the ethics of Sadeh are under challenge from the vengeful spirit of Sharon. The IDF has gone deeper into Gaza city than it did in 2009 and 2014 and Hamas is better prepared with more fortifications and tunnels. With civilian casualties spiralling, intense bombardments and close-quarters fighting under way, the concept of an ethical and legal war is being tested to the brink. After the current fighting in Gaza is over, General Halevi’s roles as head of the Southern Command and of the IDF overall will come under scrutiny. Hamas’s surprise attack in October showed an extraordinary lapse in intelligence gathering. General Halevi was the first senior official to accept responsibility, saying on October 12th that “the IDF is responsible for the security of the state and its citizens” and that on the morning of the attack “we failed”. People close to him believe that he intends to resign in the not-too-distant future. But first he has his last war to fight. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza,"IN THE 18 years since withdrawing from the Gaza Strip, Israel has invaded it, in force, twice. The first occasion was Operation Cast Lead, which involved a 15-day ground invasion in January 2009. The second was Operation Protective Edge in 2014, in which the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spent 19 days on the ground. A third ground invasion, in response to the massacre of Israeli civilians by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, is imminent. It looks likely to be larger, longer and more violent than anything that came before. Air strikes and artillery, including missiles launched from land and sea, are already pounding Gaza. This is taking place on a massive scale and with less deliberation and advance warning than in previous campaigns. Israeli officials say that the IDF is no longer applying its policy of “roof knocks”, whereby the air force would give warning of air strikes by first launching a harmless round on the targeted building. At least 900 Palestinians, many of them civilians, have so far been killed, according to the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza. Israeli political leaders are now considering the scope of their ground offensive. One option is a shallow incursion of the sort which occurred in 2014, when the IDF captured territory adjacent to the border with the aim of closing tunnels used to smuggle food, fighters and arms. It stuck to the outskirts of main towns to avoid urban warfare. Another is a deeper invasion to occupy larger tracts of the Gaza Strip, a densely packed area of more than 2m people, including entering cities, as in 2009. Yet these past approaches may seem inadequate to Israelis given the widespread revulsion at Hamas’s atrocities. “The scope of this is going to be bigger than before and more severe. It’s not going to be clean…We are going to go very, very aggressively against Hamas,” Israel’s military spokesman, Richard Hecht, told reporters on Tuesday morning. “We should all change the paradigm.” Israeli leaders have promised to “destroy Hamas”, rather than simply weaken it, as in the past. “The era of reasoning with these savages is over,” declared Gilad Erdan, Israel’s envoy to the United Nations. “Now is the time to obliterate Hamas terror infrastructure, to completely erase it, so that such horrors are never committed again.” News of a gruesome massacre in Kfar Aza, a southern kibbutz, has hardened the mood. Some have hinted at collective punishment. “Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified,” said an Israeli general. “Human beasts are dealt with accordingly.” Hamas, notes Daniel Byman of Georgetown University, is deeply rooted in Gaza, embedded in a range of charities, schools and mosques. “Separating Hamas from Gaza is an almost impossible task,” he says. A re-occupation of Gaza is implausible. Israel left it in 2005 in part because it was so costly to hold. In the West Bank, notes Mr Byman, Israel uses the Palestinian Authority, Hamas’s rival, as a sort of auxiliary force. That is not an option in Gaza. Using Israeli troops would bog down a large proportion of the IDF, leaving it short-staffed in the restive West Bank. “The last thing Israeli politicians would want would be a steady drip-drip of casualties from Gaza, where every week there’s more Israeli death.” An alternative approach would be a larger version of Cast Lead. The IDF is not yet ready for that. It has mobilised 360,000 reservists, almost as many as during the Yom Kippur war of 1973. However, many of these troops are not combat soldiers but ballast for intelligence units, air-force squadrons and logistics units. The IDF is likely to deploy two armoured divisions and one lighter airborne division, each of which has five brigades. Some of these units are waiting for their tanks and other armour to reach staging areas around Gaza. Others took losses over the last several days of combat with Hamas. If Israeli leaders eventually order a large-scale invasion, one or two armoured brigades with tanks would probably push 6km west to the coast either north or south of Deir al-Balah, a central city, to cut Gaza in two. Two or three other brigade-sized units—a few thousand men each—would probably focus on the north, including around Gaza city, and one or two others on Khan Yunis or Rafah in the south. Their aim would probably be to target Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a separate militant group close to Iran, focusing on leaders and infrastructure that could not be struck from the air, or where doing so would entail particularly high civilian casualties. Hamas has several hundred kilometres of tunnels in Gaza. Locating their entrances and dropping in explosives will be a priority. The biggest challenge will be urban warfare, a notoriously messy business. In 2014 Hamas used small but heavily armed assault squads, equipped with machine guns, anti-tank guided missiles and grenades, and sometimes wearing IDF uniforms, to inflict casualties on even the best Israeli and armoured formations, according to a study by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank. “Resistance to Israeli ground forces was skilful, adaptive and conducted coherently,” notes the study. “Personnel were willing to engage in close combat with Israeli forces and conducted infiltration and ambush missions with determination.” Much will depend on which of Israel or Hamas has learnt more effectively from that previous round of fighting. The IDF will take heart from its recent experience in the West Bank. In July two small brigade teams of 1,000 men in total, without tanks or infantry fighting vehicles, entered the town of Jenin for 48 hours, destroyed dozens of buildings used by militants and killed 12 Palestinians, nearly all of whom were thought to be combatants. The IDF lost only two soldiers. Its job will also be made easier in Gaza because Hamas lost over 1,500 men during its raid; those are likely to have included many of its most motivated fighters. Israel’s success in Jenin was achieved mainly through diligent planning, good intelligence, quick movement and constant drone coverage. The latter will be impossible to replicate in Gaza, given the sheer number of drones that would be required for blanket coverage, but the IDF might choose to work in stages, focusing on a few neighbourhoods at a time. Drones will be even more crucial in this campaign because the massive array of ground-based cameras and sensors around Gaza was decimated during Hamas’s raid. Colonel Roi Levy, the head of the IDF’s elite “Ghost” unit, a highly specialised and secretive reconnaissance outfit designed to find hidden objects, was also killed on October 7th. A massive invasion will face several constraints, apart from delays in assembling the force. Israeli casualties could be severe, potentially pushing the IDF to employ more firepower. “I think it’ll be willing to inflict a lot of casualties,” says Mr Byman, “both to restore deterrence, but also to protect its forces.” The IDF will also have to guard its northern border in case Hizbullah, a powerful Lebanese militant group, joins the fray. Towns in northern Israel have been evacuated. Late on October 10th Israel also responded to attacks from Syria with artillery fire. A further complication is the presence of over 100 Israeli and foreign hostages in Gaza. Hamas has threatened to execute one each time Israel strikes civilian homes “without advanced warning”. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, has called for the IDF to “not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration.” The IDF will use special forces to find and rescue hostages if it can, but Hamas is likely to have dispersed them over a wide area, including underground. On October 10th Joe Biden, America’s president, offered strident support for Israel, promising military aid, some of which has already been sent. Israel has asked for precision-guided munitions and interceptors for its Iron Dome missile-defence system, both of which might run short in a prolonged war. British, French, German and Italian leaders have also offered their support. But a backlash from Arab states is inevitable, potentially jeopardising Israel’s effort to normalise ties with Saudi Arabia, a process which had been accelerating in recent weeks. Ultimately, Israeli leaders are caught between the maximalist rhetoric of eliminating Hamas and the implausibility of re-occupying Gaza. Hamas leaders and a large proportion of fighters are likely to emerge from their bunkers and restore control over the strip the minute the IDF leaves. Even if Israel were to succeed in smashing the group, it is unclear to whom Israel would then turn to administer the territory. During his long career in Israeli politics, Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has been cautious in using military force, despite his public hawkishness. Yet the trauma of October 7th—which Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, described as the bloodiest day for Jews since the Holocaust—may have a profound effect. “The Israeli willingness to bear—and exact—costs is much higher than in the past,” says Natan Sachs of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington. “Just as the US would do things on 9/12 it wouldn’t have dreamed of doing on 9/10…so Israel is very different than the Israel of 10/6.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/10/27/marc-weller-on-what-international-law-has-to-say-about-the-israel-hamas-conflict,"LAW ACCEPTS the reality that war is a feature of human relations. Hence, law in war is meant to strike a balance between the need to use force in extreme circumstances and the wish to reduce the prospect of war and keep the associated human suffering to a minimum. This balancing act takes two forms. The UN Charter limits the right of states to make war. Humanitarian law limits the means of warfare. The UN Charter permits necessary and proportionate self-defence. But it is not always easy to determine how much force is proportionate to an armed attack and necessary to prevent the next one. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11th 2001, for instance, it was widely accepted that America enjoyed the right of self-defence, even against a non-state actor like al-Qaeda. But how much force would be proportionate to the murder of over 3,000 people in New York? American forces were entitled to pursue and defeat al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, where Osama Bin Laden’s group was mainly based. Arguably, this included the right to go as far as overthrowing the Taliban government, which was so closely intertwined with al-Qaeda that it would have been impossible to defeat the one without at the same time taking on the other. In response to the horrific attack of October 7th, Israel, too, is entitled to self-defence. But what is a proportionate response to the horrendous atrocity that cost some 1,400 mainly civilian lives and still exposes over 200 hostages to ceaseless terror? Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, asserts that it is necessary to eradicate Hamas as a political and military force if further outrages are to be prevented. Even if self-defence goes that far, there is still more balancing of competing values to be done under the second branch of applicable law, humanitarian law. A civilian population remains protected by the fundamental principles of humanitarian law even in a conflict triggered by an indefensible outrage of the kind mounted by Hamas, which evidently does not play by humanity’s rules. Israel fully accepts this fact. The difficulty arises, again, with respect to proportionality—this time as an element of humanitarian law. The first principle of humanitarian law is that of distinguishing between combatants and civilians along with the obligation to ensure the protection of civilians. Attacks must not be directed against a civilian population. This prohibition includes indiscriminate aerial bombardments of civilian areas. Where it is impossible to isolate civilians from an attack against a lawful, military objective, proportionality requires a balancing of the military advantage gained through the attack against the extent of civilian damage it will foreseeably cause. Humanitarian law states that if “incidental loss of civilian life would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” then the operation must not take place. Israel argues that, given the gravity of the threat to its national security and the lives of its citizens, this provision must not place undue restrictions on its military campaign. Sharvit Baruch, formerly a senior legal adviser to Israel’s armed forces, argues: “Even if many civilians in Gaza are harmed during the attacks”, when weighed against Israel’s overwhelming security interest in defeating Hamas “this is not necessarily excessive incidental damage and therefore [these] would not be disproportionate attacks that are illegal.” This view would unhinge the law on the protection of civilians. The extent of its application cannot be relative, depending on the sense of injustice and threat felt by the state using force. Every state going to war will inevitably feel that its vital interests are at stake. But this becomes a judgment on how far force can be used in self-defence under the UN Charter, and not on the extent to which civilians must be protected under humanitarian law when that force is used. Humanitarian law requires that the military advantage of each and every combat operation during conflict needs to be balanced against the risk of civilian casualties, even if vital interests of the state mounting the operation are at stake. Colonel Baruch adds that “Since Hamas places its military infrastructure in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip, including in residential houses, schools, mosques and businesses, it is permissible to direct attacks toward these sites, as they have lost their civilian nature and have become legitimate targets due to this use.” Again, the fact that Hamas operates from a densely populated territory does not strip the civilian population in that territory of legal protection. These are not willing human shields, even if Hamas may attempt to keep them in place through misinformation and propaganda. Attacks against Hamas can only be undertaken if there is no foreseeable risk of causing excessive civilian casualties when compared to the military advantage gained from the attacks being contemplated. Israel asserts that it is fulfilling its duty of distinguishing between civilians and combatants by telling the population of northern Gaza to evacuate. At a tactical level, where a specific building is to be attacked, such measures may be legitimate or even legally required. However, even where Hamas has networks of subterranean tunnels, clearing out a million civilians in order to generate a clear field of fire throughout all of northern Gaza is not permitted. Israel cannot discharge its duty of distinction between combatants and civilians simply by wishing the entire civilian population away. This may make it far more difficult for Israel to wage this war, but it cannot simply transfer the risks involved in armed combat in an urban environment from its soldiers to civilians. The International Committee of the Red Cross has issued a declaration confirming that this displacement is incompatible with humanitarian law, especially as southern Gaza, the area to which the population is supposed to move, is also subject to attack and deprived of that which will be necessary for those living or moving to survive—unless aid arrives consistently and reliably. The refusal to allow sufficient quantities of humanitarian supplies into the area, delivered under international control and supervision, can also not be justified by whatever military advantage such a strategy is meant to yield. Even if, as Israel asserts, Hamas is secretly holding its own stocks of fuel and supplies and reserving them for war rather than for other Gazans, this cannot justify withholding from civilians, crowded together in a position of extreme vulnerability, what they need to survive.■ Marc Weller is professor of international law and international constitutional studies at the University of Cambridge.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/13/israel-faces-the-danger-of-fighting-on-a-second-front,"AS ISRAEL ORDERS an evacuation of Gaza and prepares to invade it there are ominous signals on its northern border with Lebanon, where the opening of a second front would dramatically complicate Israel’s military position and escalate the conflict. Speaking from Lebanon on October 13th Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, said there was “every possibility” of a second front if Israel’s blockade of Gaza were to continue. The fighters of Hizbullah, the Iran-backed Shia militia based in Lebanon, are gung-ho. “Imagine what we could do,” says a commander just back from Lebanon’s border with Israel. There are “game changing” plans to cross the border, he says, and capture the Galilee and northern Israel. Israeli strikes on Hizbullah would be returned by Hizbullah rockets, destroying Tel Aviv “tower for tower”. Israel’s nuclear reactor is a far easier target, he says, than Iran’s nuclear installations are for the West. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas Hyperbole perhaps, but some Lebanese are preparing for war. Southerners clog roads heading north and in Beirut people queue for petrol. At night a city famed for parties is a ghost town. “Death is a cup from which we all have to drink,” says a driver, quoting the Prophet Muhammad. Hizbullah has already traded missiles with Israel and a handful of troops on both sides have been killed. Both sides are reinforcing: Israel in the hope that it can deter an attack. The risk of miscalculation is growing, says a United Nations observer in southern Lebanon, who has repeatedly run to his bunker each day for a week. The Shia militia could be waiting for Israel’s invasion of Gaza—just as it did in 2006, when it launched an attack two weeks into Israel’s ground operations in Gaza. Like Hamas, Hizbullah seeks an uprising against the Palestinian Authority (PA), the administration in the West Bank, which both groups see as a corrupt tool of the Israelis. “Nothing will remain of the PA,” says the commander. In its war with Hizbullah in 2006, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) were shocked by the group’s professionalism and high-quality weaponry. The guerrillas of the 1990s had morphed into something resembling a conventional army, capable of mounting complex, “swarming” attacks against poorly trained IDF tank forces. Since then Hizbullah’s capabilities have made another leap. In 2006 it fired almost 4,000 rockets at Israel over a month. Now the group’s stockpile of rockets and missiles has grown tenfold to 150,000 or so. Many are hidden among the banana plantations that have replaced the orange groves across southern Lebanon.  They have “the capacity to overwhelm a lot of Israeli defences”, says Fabian Hinz, at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank. Moreover, in 2006 Hizbullah’s arsenal largely consisted of inaccurate rockets. Over the past decade the group has acquired precision-guided missiles, with Iran’s help, some capable of landing within ten metres of their target, according to Hizbullah. These could strike Israeli bases and critical infrastructure in ways that Hizbullah could not in the last war, says Mr Hinz. It also has long-range anti-ship missiles—Chinese-inspired ones modified by Iran—that could target Israeli vessels. Hizbullah has fought in Yemen, Syria and Iraq. “We’re battle-hardened,” says the commander. “Unlike Israeli cowards. They don’t fight on the ground.” Will Hizbullah act? It appears to be weighing several factors, perhaps why its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, delayed a speech widely expected on October 10th. One is the fragile state of Lebanon, which is suffering from an economic and financial implosion that has seen its currency lose 98% of its value. Hizbullah is immune from this in a narrow sense: in order to evade American sanctions it runs a parallel financial system and pays its fighters in dollars, on time. But many Lebanese fear that the Shia, once the country’s underdogs, will drag them into another war. Hizbullah has to consider its place in the country. Some non-Shia politicians say they are sceptical it will attack. And a key consideration is the appetite of Hizbullah’s patron, Iran, for a regional conflict. Iran’s foreign minister, Mr Amirabdollahian, has said that the Hamas attacks were “spontaneous and entirely Palestinian”. Western governments say they have no evidence that Iran directed the Hamas attack. Still, according to the Hizbullah commander, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is providing logistical support in Lebanon. Iran’s decision making has become more hardline. Since president Ebrahim Raisi took over from Hassan Rouhani in 2021 he has filled his cabinet with former generals. A similar trend has occurred in other places where Iran holds sway. Pro-Iranian militias dominate Iraq’s government. A military commander recently replaced a civilian as head of Hamas’s administration in Gaza and a reshuffle of power among Houthi rebels in Yemen has seen militants come to the fore. By allowing Hizbullah to open a second front with Israel, Iran would hope to kill off the Abraham accords between Israel and some Arab countries and spark an anti-Western surge across the Middle East. Against this, many believe that Iran wants to preserve Hizbullah’s rocket arsenal in order to deter an attack on Iran’s nuclear programme. And outside powers are a source of restraint on Iran and by extension Hizbullah. China, Iran’s largest trading partner, is very unlikely to support a regional war that would force up oil prices, which are already rising towards $90 per barrel. The arrival of an American aircraft-carrier strike group off Lebanon’s coast has also concentrated minds. President Joe Biden was speaking to Hizbullah and Iran when he said, “To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don’t. Don’t.” Are they listening? Part of the militia’s strategy is to keep Israel permanently on edge. “See you in Kiryat Shmona” are the parting words of the Hizbullah’s commander, referring to an Israeli city over the border. He did not say when.■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/16/wartime-leaders-usually-get-a-popularity-bump-israels-hasnt,"AT THE START of wars or national-security crises, democratic leaders usually enjoy a surge in popular support. In the two weeks after the attacks of September 11th 2001 George W. Bush’s approval rating rose from 51% to 90%. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has seen no such bump. The first polls taken since Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, killed over 1,400 people on October 7th suggest that rather than rallying around the flag, Israelis are turning on their government. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas On October 11th Camil Fuchs, a statistician at Tel Aviv University, released a survey of 620 Jewish Israelis, in which 95% of respondents expressing an opinion said that Hamas’s raid represented a failure by Mr Netanyahu’s government. Even among those who had voted for parties in his right-wing coalition, this share was 93%. By nearly as large a margin respondents said that the authorities’ lapse was even more serious than that at the start of the Yom Kippur war of 1973, when Israel failed to anticipate simultaneous surprise attacks by Egypt and Syria. The poll did not ask whether Mr Netanyahu should resign immediately but three-quarters of those with opinions said that the prime minister should step down once hostilities end. Two days later Maariv, an Israeli newspaper, released its first poll of voting intentions since the Hamas attack. It found that if elections were held today, a centrist alliance of opposition parties led by Benny Gantz, a former defence minister who recently agreed to join an emergency war cabinet, would secure a majority with 78 seats while the governing coalition would win just 42. Respondents also said they would prefer Mr Gantz as prime minister to Mr Netanyahu by a margin of 48% to 29%. Facing such grim numbers at home, Mr Netanyahu might find some solace abroad. In an online survey in France conducted in May by YouGov, respondents who were asked if they sympathised more with the Israeli or Palestinian side of the conflict preferred the Palestinians by 22% to 13%. Last week that ratio had reversed, as 29% of French participants leaned towards the Israelis, compared with 14% for the Palestinians. YouGov’s polls in America show a similar pattern. From July 2014 to this March, Israel’s lead over the Palestinians in support from Americans shrank from 27 percentage points to 18. Last week it bounced back to 33 points: 42% of respondents backed Israel, and just 9% supported the Palestinians. A survey by CNN on October 12th and 13th found that 90% of Americans expressing an opinion thought that Israel’s military response to the attacks was at least partially justified. As Israel’s assault on Gaza gathers pace, however, things may change yet again. In YouGov’s poll both sides gained around seven percentage points of support, compared with March among American participants aged 18-29—already the age group least friendly to Israel. In contrast, the share of respondents who were unsure or felt equal sympathy for both sides fell sharply. In other words, Hamas’s attack has pushed undecided young Americans to pick a side; for each former waverer who chose the Israelis, another opted for the Palestinians. As international attention turns from Hamas’s atrocities to the human cost of Israel’s retaliatory air strikes in the Gaza Strip, support for Israel may once again ebb away. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/23/israel-strikes-a-hostage-deal-but-says-the-gaza-war-isnt-over,"SINCE it began seven weeks ago, Israel’s war in Gaza has had two main objectives: to remove Hamas from power in the enclave, and to free the hostages Hamas abducted during its murderous rampage on October 7th. At times those goals have been in conflict. Air strikes meant to damage Hamas’s network of underground tunnels, for instance, risked killing the hostages held in those same tunnels. The war now faces perhaps its biggest contradiction yet. On November 22nd, after weeks of indirect talks, the Israeli cabinet approved a deal that would see Hamas free 50 women and children out of the roughly 240 hostages in Gaza. But Israel will temporarily have to halt its war and will face strong pressure not to resume it. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas For the 2.2m Palestinians trapped in Gaza, meanwhile, the truce will bring a different dissonance. A few days of calm, and a promised influx of humanitarian aid, will be a small respite. But few will be able to savour it, crammed as they are into dirty, overcrowded shelters—and fearing that, when the truce ends, another round of fighting is likely to follow. The prisoner swap and four-day truce were set to begin on November 24th, after The Economist went to press. Hostages would be released in phases: about a dozen each night, sent from Gaza to Egypt and then to Israel. For each hostage freed, Israel was to release three Palestinian prisoners (women and teenagers) from its jails. Israel also agreed to allow 300 lorries carrying humanitarian aid to enter Gaza each day during that period—a significant increase over the previous month, when the daily average was just 45 lorries. President Joe Biden welcomed the pact, but cautioned that “it is important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented”. Polls have shown Israelis are divided over such a scheme. The Israel Democracy Institute, a think-tank, found that 45% of Israeli Jews opposed a prisoner swap, while 40% supported it. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national-security minister, called it a “very, very big mistake”. The limited number of hostages Hamas agreed to release and its demand for a temporary truce are meant to exploit such divisions in Israel. Negotiations began almost immediately after the massacre on October 7th. Israel and its allies applied pressure on Qatar, which hosts some of the Hamas leaders. They warned Qatar that ties with the West could be harmed if it did not produce a deal. That led to the freeing of four female hostages, proving that Qatar could serve as a go-between with Hamas, which received nothing in return. Four days after the release of the second pair of women, however, Israel sent troops into Gaza. That reshaped the negotiations. Hamas indicated that it could release a larger number of hostages—but only in return for a pause in fighting. At that point it became a question of numbers and the length of a truce, with Israel unwilling to suspend the war for any fewer than 100 captives. Hamas officials in Qatar and Lebanon signalled their initial agreement. But it soon became clear that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, would not accept that number. As pressure mounted, Mr Sinwar did not answer his phone for days. The Israeli war cabinet was also split. Some members wanted to continue negotiating over a smaller number. Others thought Israel should press ahead with its ground offensive and wait for Hamas to soften its position. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, failed to come down on either side of the debate. “Netanyahu’s dithering meant Israel wasn’t making any decisions, either on the next stage of the ground campaign, or on the hostages,” says an Israeli security official. It took goading from both the families of hostages and from the Biden administration to convince Israel to accept a scaled-down deal. Under the terms of the agreement, Hamas also has the option of offering to release more hostages at the end of the four-day period. Each ten additional captives it sets free will buy another 24 hours of truce. Israel fears this will give Mr Sinwar some control over events. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has sent four divisions, more than 10,000 soldiers, into northern Gaza to destroy Hamas’s military infrastructure. They have not finished doing so. More crucially, they have yet to start a serious campaign in southern Gaza, where Israel believes Hamas’s leaders—along with almost the entire population of Gaza—have fled. The pause will give Hamas fighters, many of them holed up in tunnels, a chance to regroup and resupply. Israel will also face pressure to extend the truce, both from some Western allies and from the relatives of those hostages still in captivity. A few days of calm could give the world a more detailed picture of the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, which would add to the international outcry. Still, both of Israel’s war objectives remain intact. “The war will continue until we achieve all of our goals,” Mr Netanyahu said before the cabinet vote. And although much of the world is united in calling for a permanent ceasefire, Mr Biden argues it would leave Hamas intact to menace Israel again. For Hamas, meanwhile, survival is victory: it need not defeat the IDF, merely endure until a ceasefire. That would not feel like victory for most Gazans, who are furious with Hamas for inviting devastation upon them. Gaza’s health ministry stopped updating the death toll on November 10th, when it stood at 11,078. Officials said it is no longer possible to count the dead: many hospitals are not functioning, communications are often cut and bodies cannot be retrieved. The real toll is undoubtedly much higher. The paltry flow of aid through Egypt has left many struggling to find food, medicine and clean water. Fuel deliveries are limited to the two tankers a day that Israel allows the UN to import. “Even if we get fuel, what would we do with it?” asks Umm Muhmmad, a resident of Gaza city now staying in Rafah. “Our homes are gone. Our cars are gone. What would we do with the fuel?” An estimated 1.7m Gazans, 77% of the population, have been displaced. More than half are crammed into teeming shelters run by the UN, where 160 people share each toilet and 700 people must use each shower. Skin diseases and diarrhoea are rife. A brief pause in the fighting will not offer Gazans much respite from this miserable existence. “The truce is empty talk,” says Alaa Labad, who was displaced from northern Gaza to a UN school in Khan Younis in the centre. “Israel will not allow us to return to our homes during it.” Many no longer have homes to return to: satellite imagery suggests that perhaps half of the buildings in the northern part of the enclave have been destroyed or badly damaged. Instead of going home, they may be displaced again. Before the pause in fighting the IDF warned some residents of Khan Younis to evacuate, suggesting that it planned to intensify air strikes—a likely prelude to a ground offensive. On November 22nd, as the truce grew closer, there was also little sign of a lull in Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza. A group of young men carried a body, shrouded in an old curtain, from the rubble of a house as rescue workers clambered through the debris of the ruined building. Witnesses said 20 people had been living there: many houses in Rafah and Khan Younis are packed with multiple families who have fled from the north. A major Israeli offensive in the south would almost certainly have a horrific cost for Palestinians—one reason why so many want a ceasefire. That was certainly the message at the Manama Dialogue, an annual security pow-wow that began in Bahrain on November 18th. One after another, officials from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries demanded an end to the war. From Manama, Arab foreign ministers then set out on a tour of world capitals to push for a ceasefire, starting with stops in Beijing on November 20th and Moscow the next day. Some observers in Washington took this as a strong rebuke: America’s Arab allies visiting its geopolitical rivals to urge a shift in its Middle East policy. Seen another way, though, it was a sign of their impotence. Neither China nor Russia has any leverage to impose a ceasefire. Many Arab leaders are keen to distance themselves from playing a major role in post-war Gaza. They have tried to swat down talk, for example, of an Arab peacekeeping force in the enclave. “Let me be very clear,” said Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister, at the conference. “There will be no Arab troops going to Gaza. None. We’re not going to be seen as the enemy.” Their reluctance is understandable. Arab leaders do not want to clean up Israel’s mess and help it police their fellow Arabs. But they also do not wish to see Israel reoccupy the enclave, and they admit, at least in private, that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is too weak to resume full control of Gaza. But if none of those options is realistic or desirable, it is not clear what is. Officials in wealthy Gulf states also say they are loth to pick up the tab for rebuilding Gaza. It is too early to put a price tag on the damage, but it could easily run into the tens of billions of dollars: after a far less devastating war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in 2014, donors pledged $5.4bn for reconstruction. Diplomats from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates say they should not be expected to write cheques unless Israel commits to a serious peace process with the Palestinians and until the PA, notorious for corruption, is reformed. After nearly two months of war, there is little optimism. Some Israelis will be reunited with their loved ones; others will have their hopes dashed. Civilians in Gaza will probably have just a short break from bombardment. A ceasefire seems far off; a happier post-war order for Gaza, further still. After a few days the truce will end, and the fighting will resume. ■ Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/11/02/could-the-israel-hamas-war-trigger-unrest-across-the-arab-world,"Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas ANOTHER DEADLY war between Israel and Hamas is a tragedy for Israelis and Palestinians. It also risks crises beyond the Holy Land. So far the war remains mostly confined to Gaza’s borders (though there are risks of a second front opening with Lebanon). But secondary effects, in the form of mass protests, are a mounting concern for “the Arab world”, a collection of 450m people spread across nearly two dozen countries. The region is sympathetic to the Palestinians: their dispossession is apt to stir up anger and protest like little else. Risk modelling by EIU, our sister company, shows which countries are particularly vulnerable to social unrest. The EIU grades countries on a scale from zero (the lowest risk of unrest) to four (the highest). Three countries have had their scores revised higher since the outbreak of war in Gaza: Egypt, Jordan and Yemen are now considered to be more at risk given their political or geographical proximity to the conflict, which could inflame pre-existing tensions. In Yemen existing risk factors (including a broken economy and dire living standards) could be aggravated by the war, given the strong anti-Israel sentiment in the country and the risk of escalation by the Iran-backed Houthis, who are fighting government forces in a long-running civil war, against Israel. The country is now at level four on the EIU’s scale. Egypt and Jordan, which neighbour the Palestinian territories, are graded three and four, respectively (up from two and three since September). Both are in dire economic straits, with Egypt’s average inflation for 2023 hitting 37% and Jordan’s unemployment rate above 20% (see chart). These factors could now mix badly with populations increasingly at odds with their governments’ handling of the war. Both Egypt and Jordan have diplomatic ties with Israel, which has infuriated Egyptians and Jordanians during the latest round of fighting. In Egypt, a recent rally in support of Palestinians quickly turned into an anti-government protest, with some chanting slogans popular during the Arab Spring in 2011. In Jordan, where almost half of the population is of Palestinian origin, growing anger led the government to recall its ambassador to Israel on November 1st—the first of the Arab countries with diplomatic ties to Israel to do so. Even before the war began some countries were in a critical state, so the current fighting has not affected their EIU scores. In Sudan, for instance, a civil war between paramilitary rebels and government forces has raged since April. Lebanon—which is four years into one of the worst economic crises in modern history—is also highly vulnerable to unrest. For now, protests across the Arab world in support of Palestinians have remained mostly peaceful. But governments are on high alert. As the war escalates, investor confidence may begin to dry up and countries that rely on tourism (such as Egypt and Tunisia) may see arrivals begin to shrivel. That is particularly problematic for countries where economies are already struggling. Combined with existing anti-government sentiment, a deterioration of living standards may lead to even more unrest in a region that is no stranger to it.■"

https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-aftermath-of-the-war-with-israel-will-shape-palestinian-life,"For more than a decade, life in the Palestinian territories was painfully static. The occupied West Bank was ruled by the corrupt nationalists of Fatah, and blockaded Gaza was run by the corrupt Islamists of Hamas. Residents of the West Bank endured the daily abuses of occupation. Those in Gaza suffered occasional short wars, and longer periods where life was calm but miserable. There was no progress towards a two-state solution—nor any reconciliation between the two estranged Palestinian factions. Everything changed in 2023. Even before October 7th, it was the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the West Bank. Then, on a quiet autumn morning, Hamas militants crossed the border into Israel and massacred more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Israel declared war immediately. Thousands of air strikes and, later, a ground invasion have laid waste to Gaza and killed more Palestinians than any war since 1948.  The coming year will reshape Palestinian life in a way unseen since 2007, when Hamas seized control of Gaza. How it will turn out is impossible to predict, but three important factors will do much to shape the outcome. The first is when, and under what circumstances, Israel will end its war in Gaza. The army says it will stop when it has removed Hamas from power. It will certainly hope to kill the group’s leaders. But Hamas has tens of thousands of militants and even more supporters.  Israel could find itself stuck in a long guerrilla war, and the residents of Gaza stuck in a long displacement. The second is what will follow the war. America and Israel hope the Gulf states will step in with money for reconstruction and, perhaps, troops for an international peacekeeping force. They would probably do the former; the latter is a harder sell. Arab leaders will, in turn, urge the Fatah-run Palestinian Authority (PA), which controls parts of the West Bank, to return to run Gaza. That is a best-case scenario. But the PA might not want to return to Gaza with the help of Israeli tanks.  And even if it did, it might find that it is unable to govern the territory (it has already lost control of bits of the West Bank). That would leave Israel in charge of security and basic services, perhaps with the help of a jerry-rigged government of local notables. Instead of reuniting the Palestinians, the war could reinforce their split. That points to a third question: the fate of the PA and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas. Half of Palestinians want to dissolve the PA, which they see as hopelessly corrupt, and 80% want Mr Abbas, who will soon start the 20th year of his four-year term, to resign. He is unlikely to listen, and he lacks a clear successor. Various apparatchiks hope to replace him, such as Majed Faraj, who heads the PA’s intelligence services, and Jibril Rajoub, a former security chief, but none is popular. Optimists hope that there might be a silver lining in a blood-soaked 2023: that the PA (flawed, corrupt but much more moderate than Hamas) could emerge strengthened, and a shocked Israel could re-commit itself to peace talks. But these days, optimism is in short supply. ■ Gregg Carlstrom, Middle East correspondent, The Economist, Dubai"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/12/will-israels-agony-and-retribution-end-in-chaos-or-stability,"In a static decades-long conflict that has rotted for the past 20 years, it can be hard to believe that real change is possible. Be in no doubt, however, that Hamas’s murderous assault has blown up the status quo between Israel and the Palestinians. The coming weeks will determine whether war in Gaza sinks the Middle East deeper into chaos or whether, despite Hamas’s atrocities, Israel can begin to create the foundations for regional stability—and, one day, peace. Change is inevitable because of the gravity of Hamas’s crimes. More than 1,200 Israelis, most of them civilians, many of those women and children, were murdered in their homes, on the street, in kibbutzim, at a music festival. Perhaps 150 more have been dragged to Gaza and shut in makeshift dungeons. Israel’s belief that it could indefinitely manage Palestinian hostility with money and air strikes crumpled early on October 7th, as the first Hamas bulldozer breached the security fence. Hamas has chosen mass murder and there is no going back. Gaza is now awaiting a huge Israeli ground offensive. Its extent and success will determine the legacy of Hamas’s bloody assault. So will the fundamental choice that Israel’s politicians face after the worst catastrophe in their country’s history: do they unite or continue to exploit divisions for their own advantage? A third factor is the choices of Israel’s Middle Eastern neighbours, including Iran. In the weeks and months ahead Israel’s leaders carry a heavy responsibility to temper their understandable desire for fire and retribution with a hard-headed calculation about their country’s long-term interests and an unwavering respect for the rules of war. They left their people vulnerable by failing to foresee Hamas’s looming attack. They must not compound their error by failing to see ahead clearly for a second time. The need for vision begins with the imminent ground offensive. The Israel Defence Forces will rightly strike deep and hard at Hamas. But how deep and how hard? Israel will be tempted to unleash a spasm of briefly satisfying violence. Its defence minister has called Hamas fighters “human animals”, and announced a blockade of food, water and energy. Israeli officials—and President Joe Biden—have taken to comparing Hamas to Islamic State, or ISIS, an Islamist group that America vowed to eradicate. That comparison is dangerous because, although Hamas deserves to be eradicated, achieving that goal in an enclave of 2m impoverished people with nowhere to flee will be impossible. A better comparison than ISIS is the 9/11 attacks in 2001, not just because of Israel’s agony, but also because America’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq show how steeply the costs of invasion mount—which is precisely Hamas’s calculation. At such a moment, self-restraint matters more than ever. It is in Israel’s interest, because street fighting is perilous and the hostages are defenceless. It makes the operation militarily sustainable and preserves international support. It avoids playing into the hands of foes who calculate that dead Palestinian women and children will further their cause. By clinging to its identity as a state that values human life,  Israel becomes stronger. Restraint in the ground offensive depends on the choices of Israel’s politicians. Before the war they were tearing the country apart over a new law curbing the Supreme Court. For now grief and horror have brought people back together, but the left blames the far-right government of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, for poisoning relations with the army and security services over the court, and neglecting security in Gaza because of a fixation with helping Jewish settlers in the West Bank. The right counters that calls for civil disobedience by senior officials opposed to Mr Netanyahu were a green light for Hamas. Mr Netanyahu must try to use his new war cabinet, announced this week, to unite Israel. Only by healing its own politics will the country be able to deal with Gaza. Mr Netanyahu will not want to help his most plausible rivals for office. Yet he was the man in charge when Hamas struck and his political career is ending. Having spent a lifetime seeking power at any price, he should finally put his country before himself. A unified, centrist government would also be better placed to cope with the last set of challenges: the politics of the Middle East. Israel will be in grave peril if the war in Gaza spreads to its northern border with Lebanon, where tensions with Hizbullah, a formidably armed militia, are already growing ominously. The longer and bloodier the fighting in Gaza, the more Hizbullah will feel it must be seen to support its brethren. There is also a possibility of war with Iran, which has replaced Arab governments as the sponsor of Palestinian violence. Even Iran hawks in the West should not wish for that. A wider war would wreck the detente, built on the Abraham accords, between Israel and its Arab neighbours, including Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and potentially Saudi Arabia. This grouping stands for a new Middle East that is pragmatic and focused on economic development rather than ideology. It is still inchoate, but it has the potential to become a force for moderation—and possibly even security. Simply by surviving, the Abraham accords could emerge from this crisis stronger. However, Hamas has shown that the signatories’ neglect of the Palestinians is a mistake. Israel and its Arab partners need a new, optimistic vision for Gaza and the West Bank, as an alternative to Iran’s cult of violence and killing. And that leads back to the fighting in Gaza. How does it end? Israel has no good options: occupation is unsustainable, a Hamas government is unacceptable; rule by its rival, Fatah, is untenable; an Arab peacekeeping force is unattainable; and a puppet government is unimaginable. If Israel destroys Hamas in Gaza and pulls out, who knows what destructive forces will fill the vacuum left behind? Israeli strategists must therefore start thinking about how to create the conditions for life alongside the Palestinians, however remote that seems today. All those elements may have a part: a short period of martial law in Gaza, a search for Palestinian leaders acceptable to both sides, and the good offices of Arab intermediaries. The only way to eradicate Hamas is for Israel and its Arab allies to create stability—and, one day, peace. ■ For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/israels-four-unpalatable-options-for-gazas-long-term-future,"THE PUBLIC statements Joe Biden made during his lightning visit to Israel on October 18th did not suggest many misgivings about Israel’s impending invasion of the Gaza Strip. In private, however, the American president’s advisers hoped to press Israel’s leaders on an urgent question: what should happen after the war? Israeli officials say they are focused on toppling Hamas from power, in retribution for the massacre it committed in southern Israel on October 7th. “Gaza will no longer be a threat for Israel,” says Eli Cohen, the foreign minister. “We will not agree that Hamas will have any power in Gaza.” Even after the risks of fighting in such a densely populated place were illustrated by a deadly blast on October 17th at Gaza’s Ahli Arab hospital, which Israel blamed on an errant Palestinian rocket, Israel’s stated war aims have not changed. But Israel’s post-war plans remain uncertain. It has four main options, all bad ones. First is a prolonged occupation of Gaza, like the one it undertook from 1967 to 2005. Israeli troops would have to secure the enclave and, in the absence of a Palestinian government, might have to oversee basic services as well. This might please a segment of Israel’s religious right, which still fumes about the withdrawal in 2005 of all Israeli soldiers and settlers from Gaza as the abandonment of a sliver of the biblical homeland of the Jews. But no one else wants to see Gaza reoccupied, given the heavy financial burden and the likelihood of endless bad press and a steady trickle of casualties. Mr Biden warned on October 15th that a lasting occupation would be a “big mistake”. Most Israeli strategists agree. The second option is to wage a war that decapitates Hamas and then leave the territory. This is arguably the worst way forward. Some of Hamas’s leaders and supporters would probably emerge to reconstitute the group. Even if they did not, some other undesirable force would take its place. The Middle East has a history of radical groups taking advantage of ungoverned spaces. The best outcome, from Israel’s perspective, would be the return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the West Bank in co-ordination with Israel. But that path is littered with obstacles. The first is that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, is loth to do it. “I don’t think anybody can be that stupid and think he can go back to Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank,” says Ghassan al-Khatib, a former Palestinian minister. Even if Mr Abbas were able to take power that way, he may not want to. Yasser Arafat, the previous president of the PA and longtime figurehead for Palestinian nationalism, had a fondness for Gaza; he lived there for a time after being allowed to return to Palestine in 1994. People close to Mr Abbas say that he, in contrast, views Gaza as a hostile place. Gaza would almost certainly be hostile to Palestinian police sent to secure it. The PA employs around 60,000 people in its security services, which have authority in roughly a third of the West Bank (see map). It cannot control even that limited area: parts of Jenin and Nablus, cities in the northern West Bank, are so restive that the PA’s forces dare not patrol them lest they be attacked. Morale is low. If Palestinian police returned to Gaza, they would be a target for the remnants of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militants. Hamas and the PA fought a bloody civil war in Gaza after Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006. Hamas eventually prevailed and ejected the PA from the strip in 2007. Nor is security the only question. After Hamas came to power, Mr Abbas told bureaucrats in Gaza to stop working. Hamas hired tens of thousands of supporters to fill the civil service instead, while the PA continued to pay its workers to sit at home. Keeping that bureaucracy would mean working with around 40,000 people hired for their ideological loyalty to Hamas; dismissing it would repeat the mistake of America’s “de-Baathification” programme in Iraq, which threw legions of angry, unemployed men on the streets. A fourth option would be to cobble together some sort of alternate administration, composed of local notables working closely with Israel and Egypt. Israel relied on that sort of arrangement until the 1990s, before the PA began to take over civil functions  in the occupied territories. There has been talk of trying to enlist Muhammad Dahlan, a former PA security chief who grew up in Gaza, to take the reins after Hamas. But Mr Dahlan has spent the past decade in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He has fallen out with the PA; in 2016 a Palestinian court convicted him of corruption. There is also bad blood between him and families in Gaza: he led the fighting against Hamas in 2007. “I think that’s an illusion,” says Michael Milstein, a reserve colonel in the Israeli army and an analyst at the Moshe Dayan Centre, a think-tank in Tel Aviv. “I’m not even sure he’d want to come back. He’d be worried people would want him dead.” The case of Mr Dahlan points to a larger problem. The Palestinians have been divided for almost two decades. The split is largely their fault: though Hamas and PA leaders meet every couple of years to pay lip service to reconciliation, neither party wants to compromise. But the schism has also been exacerbated by the divide-and-rule policy of Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, who thought it a useful tool to stymie the Palestinian dream of an independent state. “Netanyahu had a flawed strategy of keeping Hamas alive and kicking,” says Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister. Both Hamas and the PA rule their statelets as one-party authoritarian regimes. In 2021 Nizar Banat, a critic of Mr Abbas, was beaten to death by Palestinian police at his home in Hebron. Those who oppose Hamas in Gaza risk torture and execution. Most Palestinians choose to keep silent, shunning politics and focusing on their day-to-day struggles. The most recent poll from the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) found that 65% of Gazans would vote for Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, in a head-to-head presidential race against Mr Abbas (who would lose the West Bank as well). Hamas would win 44% of the vote in Gaza in a parliamentary ballot, whereas Fatah, Mr Abbas’s faction, would take just 28%. At first glance this would suggest enduring support for Hamas. But such polls offer only a binary choice between militants and incompetents. Fully 80% of Palestinians want Mr Abbas to resign. Hours after the hospital explosion there were protests in cities across the West Bank, where demonstrators chanted: “The people demand the downfall of the president.” He is 87 and has no clear successor. None of his would-be replacements inspires much enthusiasm. In a hypothetical race between Mr Haniyeh and Muhammad Shtayyeh, the PA’s colourless prime minister, the former would win by a 45-point margin in Gaza and 21 points in the West Bank. Again, this is less a testament to Mr Haniyeh’s popularity than to Mr Shtayyeh’s lack of it: a poll in 2019, after his first 100 days in office, found that 53% of Palestinians did not even know he was the prime minister. Open-ended questions yield more telling results. When the PCPSR asked Palestinians to name their preferred successor to Mr Abbas, a plurality said they did not know. The second most popular answer, in both the West Bank and Gaza, was Marwan Barghouti, a member of Fatah serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison for orchestrating terrorist attacks in which Israeli civilians were killed. Several of the other top choices, such as Mr Dahlan and Khaled Meshal, a former Hamas leader, do not even live in the Palestinian territories. Exiles, prisoners—or no one: Palestinian political life is moribund. Palestinians blame this sorry situation on Israel, arguing that the lack of meaningful peace talks has deprived the PA of its raison d’être. “I think Mr Abbas will be the last Palestinian president,” says Mr Khatib. “The whole idea of the Palestinian Authority is that it’s a transition towards a Palestinian state. If there’s no political horizon, then the whole PA becomes irrelevant.” Israelis contend that the PA has undermined itself through rampant graft. Billions of dollars in foreign aid have been siphoned off over the past three decades to buy plush villas in Jordan and to pad bank accounts in Europe. Asked to name the main problems in Palestinian society, more people cite their own government’s corruption (25%) than Israel’s continued occupation (19%). There is blame enough to share. The result, though, is that Fatah is probably irredeemable in the eyes of most Palestinians, a liberation movement turned ossified and decadent. In recent years even some Israelis had begun to wonder if Hamas could become an interlocutor, following the same path Fatah did decades earlier, from violent militants to pliable bureaucrats. Not only had Hamas appeared focused on trying to improve Gaza’s economy, some of its leaders also seemed amenable to a two-state solution. That would have been a remarkable shift for a group whose charter used to call for Israel’s destruction. Last year Bassem Naim, a member of the group’s political leadership in Gaza, told your correspondent that it was willing to accept “a state on 1967 borders”. Ghazi Hamad, another political official, said much the same a year earlier. Such thoughts now seem naive. Mr Milstein was one of the few prominent Israelis who warned, well before the massacre, that Hamas’s apparent pragmatism was just a ruse. His view, vindicated by awful events, is now a near-universal one in Israel. Even if Hamas were willing to take part in peace talks, an angry, grieving Israeli public would not be a willing partner: the vast majority of Israelis want to obliterate Hamas, not reward it. Two other questions will shape Gaza’s future. One is what role Arab states will play. In private conversations over the past week, several Arab officials floated the idea of a foreign peacekeeping force for the enclave—but most quickly added that their country was not eager to participate. Egypt is not popular in Gaza, both because it has joined Israel in blockading the territory and because of its prior history as Gaza’s ruler from 1948 to 1967. The UAE would be hesitant to play a big role. “We don’t act solo,” says an Emirati diplomat. The same is probably true of Saudi Arabia. Israel would probably veto any role for Qatar, one of the countries with the most influence in Gaza. For years the emirate has helped stabilise Gaza’s economy with Israel’s blessing, distributing up to $30m a month in welfare payments, salaries for civil servants and free fuel. But its support for Hamas—some of the group’s leaders live there—will now make it suspect. “The whole strategy of Israel during the last decade was to trust Qatar,” says Mr Milstein. “One of the lessons we should learn from this war is that we should not give Qatar any more involvement.” Although Arab states do not want to secure Gaza, they may be willing to help rebuild it. After the last big war, in 2014, donors pledged $3.5bn for reconstruction (though by the end of 2016 they had disbursed just 51% of that). The bill will be even bigger this time. The other question is what happens to the PA. Half of Palestinians tell pollsters it should be dissolved. Doing so would deprive many of them of an income (the PA is the largest employer in the West Bank) and probably lead to more violence. But it would also raise the costs of Israel’s occupation and, perhaps, force Palestine’s long-term future back onto Israel’s political agenda after two decades in which it was rarely discussed. “It’s the only card he has left,” says a former confidant of Mr Abbas. There is no lasting solution for Gaza alone. Despite the long schism, Palestinians there still see themselves as part of a larger polity. Anyway, the strip is too small and bereft of natural resources to thrive by itself. Its economy depends on Israel’s: everything from strawberry farms to furniture factories relies on exports to its wealthier neighbour. Whoever takes control, Gaza will be neither stable nor prosperous as an isolated statelet. The only way to bring enduring quiet to Gaza is through a broader settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If the prospect of a negotiated solution evaporates completely, warns Mr Khatib, “with it, moderate leadership will vanish.” Israel can decapitate Hamas. But it is far less clear that anything better will take its place. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/15/ehud-barak-blames-binyamin-netanyahu-for-the-greatest-failure-in-israels-history,"FEW ISRAELIS have anything close to Ehud Barak’s experience of operating in Gaza. In 2000 he was prime minister and defence minister when the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, erupted in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Before that he was the commander of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) when Israel carried out its first major pullback from the cities in the Gaza Strip as part of the first Oslo Accords signed in 1993. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas And then in his second stint as defence minister, in 2009, he oversaw Israel’s largest ground operation against Hamas in Gaza to date. Now the Israeli army is gearing up for what is expected to be a much larger ground operation in Gaza. Its target is Hamas, which attacked Israeli communities and bases along the border on October 7th, killing more than 1,300 Israelis, three-quarters of them civilians. The atrocities represent “the greatest failure in Israeli history”, Mr Barak says. Now comes the military response. The army he once commanded faces huge difficulties going after a determined and well-armed enemy, entrenched in a tiny coastal enclave crowded with more than 2m inhabitants, he says. He is mindful of the implications of the inevitably heavy toll this operation will inflict on its civilian population. In the first nine days following the Hamas attack, nearly 2,400 Gazans were killed in Israeli air strikes, which Israel claims were against “Hamas targets”. Mr Barak advises the government not to rush a ground operation. “We’re not facing an existential threat from Hamas,” he says. “Israel will win this.” Once all the reservists who have been called up have undergone refresher training, Israel can take control of most of the Gaza Strip and destroy Hamas’s centres of power and military capabilities “in two to six weeks.” Unlike the major ground operations in 2009 and 2014, when Israel simultaneously entered different areas of the Gaza Strip, thinks Mr Barak, this time the offensive could be carried out in stages. Although he is confident about the army’s ability to pulverise Hamas in Gaza, the IDF will face some constraints. Israel has acknowledged that Hamas took more than 120 civilians and soldiers hostage. Mr Barak thinks that a ground operation should be delayed if an agreement can be reached to release some of them. He also wants Israel to ensure that its actions are seen as legitimate by the wider world. In the aftermath of the terrorist attack most Western governments offered Israel their full support. But “the support also comes with an expectation we abide by international law in our operations,” Mr Barak warns. “Support will erode when there is footage of ruined homes [in Gaza] with bodies of children and weeping old women.” America’s naval presence—on October 14th it deployed a second aircraft carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean—is partly designed to deter outside actors from entering or escalating the conflict. But it “also emphasises Israel’s need to operate according to international law”. Israel will need to keep a watchful eye on Hizbullah, the Iran-backed Shia militia in Lebanon. It has perhaps 150,000 rockets aimed at Israel. Israel has sent troops and tanks to the border in the hope of deterring an attack. The Hamas attack from Gaza was, says Mr Barak, based on similar Hizbullah plans to take over settlements in the north. But Hizbullah has now lost the element of surprise and Israel is prepared. “Israel doesn’t have an interest in conflict with Hizbullah right now and I don’t think they will attack now that we’ve deployed a lot of forces up north,” he says. One of America’s aircraft carriers is now looming off the coast of Lebanon, sending a signal to Hizbullah, and to its sponsor, Iran. Although Mr Barak strongly supports a ground campaign in Gaza, he is critical of talk of “destroying Hamas” by Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, as well as ministers in his government and some generals.  “What does it even mean?” he says. “That no one can still breathe and believe in Hamas’s ideology? That’s not a believable war aim. Israel’s objective now has to be clearer. It has to be that Hamas will be denied its Daesh-like military capabilities,” he says, referring to the Arabic term for Islamic State. Mr Barak believes that the optimal outcome, once Hamas’s military capabilities have been sufficiently degraded, is the re-establishment of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. The authority, which was established under the Oslo Accords and runs the autonomous parts of the West Bank, was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in a bloody coup in 2007. However he warns that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, “cannot be seen to be returning on Israeli bayonets”. There will, therefore, need to be an interim period during which “Israel will capitulate to international pressure and hand Gaza over to an Arab peacekeeping force, which could include members such as Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. They would secure the area until the Palestinian Authority could take control.” Yet for now, other countries in the region seem to have no desire to contribute troops to such a force. And then there is the great reckoning that will take place in Israel once the war ends. Questions will be asked as to who was responsible for the failures in intelligence and planning that allowed Hamas to take Israel so completely by surprise and to then reach civilian communities where they committed such horrific crimes. “The immediate operational problems are being fixed now,” he says. “But a much deeper assessment will have to take place later.” When that happens, he is convinced that the blame will fall on Mr Netanyahu. “It will be clear that, above all, Netanyahu had a flawed strategy of keeping Hamas alive and kicking… so he could use them [Hamas] to weaken the Palestinian Authority so that no-one in the world could demand that we hold negotiations [with the Palestinians].” Few people know the Israeli prime minister better than Mr Barak. The two men go back 55 years, to the days when Mr Netanyahu, then a commando in the secretive General Staff Reconnaissance Unit, served under Mr Barak, who commanded the unit. His older brother, Yoni Netanyahu, another of the unit’s commanders who was killed while rescuing hostages held at Entebbe Airport in 1976, was one of Mr Barak’s closest friends. In their political lives, they have been both close allies and bitter rivals. In 1999 Mr Barak led the Labour Party to electoral victory, ending Mr Netanyahu’s first term as prime minister. But when Mr Netanyahu returned to office in 2009 Mr Barak served as his defence minister for four years. Since he left parliamentary politics in 2013, however, he has become increasingly estranged from Mr Netanyahu. Now aged 81, he has been active in the protest movement that has taken to the streets over the past nine months in an attempt to stop Mr Netanyahu’s government from making constitutional changes to curb the powers of the Supreme Court. Mr Netanyahu, he says, ignored repeated warnings from military commanders that the divisions this was causing were also tearing the army apart. During the protests thousands of reserve soldiers and officers said they would stop volunteering for the IDF if the constitutional changes passed. Mr Netanyahu is squarely to blame for the crisis, believes Mr Barak. Israel’s strategy towards the Palestinians has backfired. “Because the deaths were mainly of civilians and the state has forsaken its most basic commitment to its citizens—to keep them alive—this was the worst type of negligence.” ■ Correction (October 16th 2023): An earlier version of this piece stated that the hostage rescue operation at Entebbe Airport, during which Yoni Netanyahu was killed, occurred in 1967. It was actually in 1976. Apologies for the error."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel,"It is hard to see past the shock of Hamas’s bloodthirsty assault on Israel. That is because it involved thousands of rockets, and fighters attacking the south of the country by land, sea and air. And because it was completely unforeseen despite its scale, inflicting a humiliating blow against Israel’s vaunted intelligence services. But most of all because of the killing of hundreds of innocent people and the taking of scores of hostages by Hamas. As the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) ponder how to respond, the world’s attention will be caught up in their desperate plight. It is too soon to know how the next few weeks will unfold. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has vowed to exact “a huge price” and he is right: Hamas must be made to pay for its atrocities, which include the massacre of more than 250 young Israelis at a festival in the south. But Israel’s response comes with grave risks. Sending IDF ground troops into Gaza could draw them into bloody urban fighting—and endanger the hostages, too. The longer the fighting drags on, the greater the chance that violence spreads to the West Bank or Lebanon. The death of many civilians in Gaza, especially if seen as wanton, would harm Israel’s standing in the world as well as being profoundly wrong in its own terms. Read more on this story: However, it is not too soon to be clear that this attack marks the end of a decades-old belief in Israel that Palestinian aspirations for sovereignty could be indefinitely put aside while the rest of the Middle East forged ahead. Whatever else emerges from this conflict, one thing will be a new search for answers to the question of how Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace. Mr Netanyahu’s policy of sidelining the Palestinians depended on three calculations, each of which has been thrown up into the air by the Hamas assault. The first is that, even if the Palestinian question was left to rot, Israelis could remain safe. As a result of the terrible casualties of the second intifada, which finished in 2005, Israel shut Palestinian populations away behind security walls. Superior intelligence and overwhelming firepower, including the Iron Dome anti-rocket system, meant that the armed threat from Palestinian fighters was manageable. That notion now looks broken. One reason the intelligence services may have been distracted from Gaza is that the West Bank has been thrown into disarray by the expansionist aims of Israel’s far right. In southern Lebanon Hizbullah has a fearsome arsenal, much of it supplied by Iran. No doubt, Israel will be able to re-establish its military dominance over the Palestinians. But even if its soldiers and spies believe that this ensures Israeli citizens are protected, voters themselves are unlikely to conclude that a return to the status quo is good enough. The second assumption was that the existence of Hamas helps Israel deal with Fatah, the Palestinian party that runs the West Bank. It was assumed that divide-and-rule kept the Palestinians weak and that the influence of radical factions would undermine the credibility of moderates as partners for peace—all of which suited Mr Netanyahu just fine. With these attacks, that notion has also run its course. One reason for Hamas to strike was that divide-and-rule has created the conditions in which Fatah has become decadent and out of touch;  its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, is ailing. With this assault, Hamas is claiming to be the true voice of Palestinian resistance. Inter-Palestinian rivalry was supposed to protect Israelis; it has ended up making them targets. The third assumption was that Israel could strengthen its position in the Middle East by pursuing regional diplomacy even as it left the Palestinians to fester. That view was endorsed by the signing of the Abraham Accords between Bahrain, Israel and the United Arab Emirates in 2020—and the addition of Morocco and Sudan later. Until this weekend, it had looked as if Saudi Arabia might join, too. Eventually, it still may, but Hamas has shown that the Palestinians have a say, too. The coming operation against Hamas will only add to the sense that the time has come for a new approach. After Saturday’s bloodshed, Israel cannot wreck Hamas only for it to remain in power in Gaza as if nothing had happened. However, no simple alternative is on offer. The IDF does not want to occupy Gaza—that is why the enclave is self-governed. The idea of an international peace-keeping force is also hard to imagine: no country wants to take on the responsibility. And yet, if the IDF destroyed Hamas in Gaza and then marched back home again, who knows what destructive forces might fill the vacuum that was left behind. Nobody should underestimate the difficulties that lie ahead. The second intifada turned young Israelis against talking to the Palestinians. This outrage will surely create a new generation of Israelis who cannot imagine how Palestinian factions could be a partner for peace. At the same time, Israel’s right-wing coalition has been focused on annexing parts of the West Bank. It will redouble these efforts. Despite that, hard-headed Israelis will need to grapple with the fact that they must once again start to deal with the Palestinian issue. Israel’s security apparatus needs a counterparty to work with if it is to have any sway over the Palestinian territories. That means it needs a Palestinian interlocutor. What comes next will depend greatly on who is in power in Jerusalem. For the moment, Israel is pulling together, but it will soon undergo a bitter reckoning that could yet lead to a new coalition, or even a new prime minister. If Israelis are to be safe, whoever is in charge will need to stop thinking of the Palestinians as a problem that can be shelved and start thinking of them as a people who must be engaged. ■ Editor’s note: This article has updated the number of young Israelis massacred at a festival in the south."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/25/israels-prime-minister-and-its-army-are-damagingly-divided,"ISRAELI SOLDIERS near the border with Gaza were surprised on October 24th to see a familiar figure visiting the kibbutzim devastated by Hamas’s attack. Arye Deri, the leader of Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party which is one of the largest in the coalition of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, also visited military units preparing for war in Gaza. A day earlier, Mr Deri had angered Israel’s military chiefs when he leaked the details of a meeting with his party members in which he had said the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) were “not ready”. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas. Mr Deri has no official role in government, nor does he have any significant military experience. Yet the prime minister has invited him in an unofficial capacity to some of the meetings of the war cabinet. His qualification is that he is an important political ally of Mr Netanyahu. War is politics by other means, and this war is increasingly politicised. While the polls show broad backing among Israelis for the ground offensive in Gaza, they also show support for Mr Netanyahu has plummeted. Some 40% of voters who supported his Likud party less than a year ago now say they would vote for someone else. Calls are growing for a national commission of enquiry to be held once the conflict has ended. On October 25th Israeli officials said they had agreed to delay the invasion of Gaza to allow America to shore up its air defences in the region. But Mr Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from his hard-right base to prove his readiness to destroy Hamas. The prime minister’s proxies have been briefing journalists that the IDF is not fully prepared for the ground campaign and that, instead of jeopardising the lives of Israeli soldiers with a rapid invasion, as Israel’s generals suggest, even more devastating air-strikes are needed to destroy Hamas’s network of tunnels. This has led to angry responses from the IDF that it is, in fact, ready. It has also prompted ugly—and accurate—headlines in the Israeli media about the discord in the war cabinet between Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Divisions within this government are not new. In March Mr Netanyahu tried to fire Mr Gallant after he publicly criticised the government’s plan to weaken the powers of the Supreme Court. The prime minister was forced to retreat in the face of massive public protests. But the growing distrust between the two since then is now hampering Israel’s war-planning. The establishment of a “unity government” with leaders of one of the opposition parties, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot—both of whom are former IDF chiefs of staff and also part of the war cabinet—has failed to bring about any actual unity. Mr Netanyahu’s relationship with Israel’s generals has long been tense. That tension has been heightened by their responses to Hamas’s attack on October 7th. “The IDF and the intelligence community were severely hit by their failure to detect and prevent the Hamas attack,” says a senior defence official. “But they’ve got back on their feet and are now just waiting for a clear idea from the government [about] what to do.” By contrast Israel’s politicians, and its prime minister in particular, still seem to be floundering. The army’s chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, has already publicly acknowledged the failure of October 7th, as have Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet, Israel’s security service, and the chief of the military intelligence branch, Major General Aharon Haliva. All are expected to resign once the war is over. The prime minister, though, has not accepted any such responsibility, beyond saying vaguely on October 25th that “only after the war” would questions be asked “of me as well”. “There are many who shoulder the blame for thinking that Hamas wouldn’t dare do something like this,” says one Knesset member from Mr Netanyahu’s coalition. “Obviously Bibi is more to blame than all the others but don’t wait for him to say so.” Instead, when he has not been in meetings with his war cabinet or welcoming foreign leaders, Mr Netanyahu has spent most of his time in recent days huddled with his political advisers and briefing journalists. He has also assembled a shadow cabinet of former generals and security officials to second-guess Mr Gallant and the IDF’s generals. The prime minister is not the only one focused on politicking. The coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties that backs Mr Netanyahu knows it may not last long: public anger and another election could sweep them away. But they are anxious to cling on for as long as possible—and to make the most of their power. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister and leader of Jewish Power, a far-right party, has made a show of handing weapons to civilians, ostensibly to prevent further terrorist attacks. But he has been trying to stoke tensions between Israeli Jews and Arab-Israelis. For now, at least, he has had no success. (He was pointedly not included in the war cabinet.) Other coalition partners have blocked efforts to get cash to help the thousands of Israeli families uprooted by the war, because they worry the money will be diverted from funding the special interests of their own communities. All the talk is of the next stage of the fighting in Gaza, not what follows it. Israel’s security establishment would prefer to see the Palestinian Authority, which was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in a bloody coup in 2007, return and take control of the area. But one senior official admits that no planning is being done on that front. For over a decade Mr Netanyahu has isolated and neglected Gaza, believing it could safely be left to fester. The attack on October 7th demonstrated how tragically that policy has failed. His politicising of the war now, and his reluctance to plan for the future, could cost Israel even more. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/24/a-blow-against-israels-supreme-court-plunges-the-country-into-crisis,"On July 24th Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, passed the first in a series of laws aimed at drastically limiting the powers of the country’s Supreme Court. Members of the opposition walked out in protest at the final reading of the law, which passed 64-0 in the 120-strong chamber, with the votes of all the members of the far-right coalition led by the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. The law all but eliminates the court’s ability to overturn government decisions on the grounds of “reasonableness”. Since the coalition presented its plans nearly eight months ago, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets in protest. Mr Netanyahu’s allies claim that in recent decades the Supreme Court has been too interventionist and that its powers should be curbed. Opponents of the reforms argue that they will undermine Israeli democracy and risk introducing majoritarian rule. The government has been unmoved. Thousands of reserve officers in Israel’s armed forces have announced that they will no longer turn up for their voluntary service, but before the vote Mr Netanyahu refused to meet the army’s chief of staff, who wanted to warn him of the security implications of the dispute. The prime minister has also brushed off a rare public warning from Israel’s closest ally: President Joe Biden called on the government to postpone the vote and try to reach a compromise with the opposition. The White House described the result as “unfortunate”. After attempts to pass the full raft of his government’s legal reforms stalled in the face of widespread opposition, Mr Netanyahu repeatedly promised that he would try to pursue the constitutional changes through consensus. That came to nothing. Under pressure from the extreme elements in his coalition, he abandoned efforts to find any kind of compromise. Instead the government took one of the original four laws they had hoped to pass earlier this year and rushed a vote on that through the Knesset in a matter of weeks. Even as the final votes were being held on Monday, Mr Netanyahu and his relatively moderate defence minister, Yoav Gallant, sought to delay the parliamentary procedure, in a last-gasp attempt to find a compromise. In the Knesset session the hardline justice minister, Yariv Levin, could be seen berating his colleagues, as Mr Netanyahu sat glumly silent. Mr Levin and other far-right members of the coalition threatened to resign if the amendment was not passed immediately. The fact that Mr Netanyahu, just back from a hospital stay to have a pacemaker fitted, was unable to persuade his allies to delay the vote suggests that his power is now limited. It is unclear what will prevent the most extreme members of the coalition of nationalist and ultra-religious parties from pursuing their political agenda, both on the legal reforms and more widely. In the aftermath of the vote Mr Levin said this was the “first step” in fixing Israel’s judicial system. Ministers have threatened to use the freedom the new law gives them to fire the independent-minded attorney-general. They could replace her with someone friendlier to the government who would be more willing to revisit the corruption charges currently facing Mr Netanyahu (which he strenuously denies). And then there are the next stages in the judicial overhaul. When the Knesset returns in October after a long summer recess, the coalition plans to put forward legislation which would give it control of the appointment of Supreme Court judges. In a speech shortly after the vote Mr Netanyahu promised that he would once again pursue consensus on these matters. His allies have no interest in any compromise, however, and the prime minister has little leverage over them. Israel may find itself in a constitutional crisis within days, well before the next pieces of legislation come up. Various civil-rights groups have already sent petitions to the Supreme Court calling for the new law to be overturned. The judges will still have legal tools to review government decisions, but these will be much more limited. If they rule that this new law restricting their powers is unconstitutional, they will be on a collision course with the government. The demonstrators who believe their country is on a slippery slope to dictatorship are not going home. Entire reserve units and squadrons could be paralysed. Major business groups have already closed their establishments in protest and the trade unions are considering a general strike. Angry protests broke out following the vote, causing havoc in central Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and elsewhere around the country. Israel is facing a tempestuous summer. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/15/israels-proposed-legal-reforms-are-a-dreadful-answer-to-a-real-problem,"There comes a point when culture wars and populism impair a country’s institutions, society and economy. That moment has arrived in Israel, where on February 20th the Knesset, or parliament, is due to hold the first reading of a legal reform bill. The bill is the project of a coalition government led by Binyamin Netanyahu that was formed after elections in November and which includes parties from Israel’s far right. In all but the rarest cases, it will prevent the Supreme Court from striking down laws that have passed through the Knesset. And it gives politicians more sway over judicial appointments. Israel’s unwritten constitution is flawed, but the changes would make things worse by allowing nearly unchecked majority rule. That could make the country less prosperous, more polarised at home and more vulnerable abroad. Part of the motivation for the reforms is personal—Mr Netanyahu is fighting corruption charges and has grown to despise the courts. But Israel’s judicial system also has genuine problems. The country has no formal constitution. Instead, the Knesset has over the years passed “basic laws” that describe institutions and establish rights. In the 1990s, after over 40 years of relative restraint, the Supreme Court suddenly asserted that these laws transcended normal legislation, and arrogated to itself the right to overrule the Knesset if it thought they were contravened. Such judicial activism was not widely envisioned when the basic laws were passed, sometimes with slim majorities. It has fed a sense that the judiciary is a creature of the old left-leaning secular elite, and out of touch with religious and right-wing Israelis. Though no definitive draft of the bill yet exists, it is likely to include two radical changes. It will severely limit the ability of the Supreme Court to override the Knesset, or allow a simple majority of the Knesset to overrule Supreme Court decisions. And it will award the government a decisive say over the appointment of judges, who are currently picked by a panel in which lawyers and judges outnumber politicians. One reason the bill is dangerous is that it leaves Israel with few checks and balances. The Knesset has only one chamber, unlike many legislatures, and Israel’s largely ceremonial president cannot block laws. Under the reforms, a government with a narrow majority could do almost anything it wanted. This would amount to majoritarian rule, a project that Mr Netanyahu has long flirted with. He and his coalition partners say they are enabling “the will of the people” to prevail. But liberal democracies require more than this: they also need institutions to prevent an individual from wielding too much power and to protect the rights of individuals and minorities. Majoritarianism is especially dangerous in Israel, because of its particular nature as a state. A fifth of citizens are Arabs, who are equal in law but often face discrimination. In addition, splits between Jewish Israelis—left and right, secular and orthodox—can be bitter. Extremist parties, once marginal, are now part of the ruling coalition. Israel also has responsibilities in the West Bank, and though Palestinians would deny that it delivers justice there, the Supreme Court has sometimes been a restraining influence on the expansion of settlements. All countries need judicious checks on power; volatile, divided ones doubly so. Israeli liberals are up in arms. Big street protests have erupted. Bosses have spoken out. Mr Netanyahu and his government may not much care—their opponents’ outrage is useful ammunition in the culture wars. But he must recognise that the damage from impairing the rule of law will go deep. Stability within Israel could be threatened if Arab citizens believe the state cannot protect their rights. Israel’s economic miracle depends on mobile capital and a liberal, globalised tech workforce that generated 54% of goods-and-services exports in 2021. The fear of unrestrained majority rule could further inflame tensions in the West Bank. And the sense that Israel is departing from liberal values will erode support in America, its vital security partner, as President Joe Biden signalled this week. Mr Netanyahu should halt the legislative process, as Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, has proposed. The judicial and political systems could certainly improve. Judges could be more representative. Relations between courts and parliament could be better defined. But it matters how constitutional reforms are decided. A broad, cross-party consensus should first form, perhaps in a constituent assembly. In many ways this is Israel’s moment. Its economy is thriving, it has new friendships in the Arab world through the Abraham accords and Iran, its great enemy, faces unrest at home. Instead of capitalising on this moment Mr Netanyahu is pursuing reforms that will make Israel weaker. He should change course.■"
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/10/31/steven-simon-thinks-that-israel-may-be-able-to-avoid-a-regional-escalation,"ON OCTOBER 7TH Hamas showed that it was true to itself by abandoning its periodic ceasefires and skirmishes with Israel and embracing Götterdämmerung. Perhaps it expected its murderous attacks to spark a regional conflict that would bring Israel to its knees, with Palestinians battered but triumphant. But this motivation seems unlikely, and we may never know. Regardless, America, Israel and key Arab states such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia must now plan for the day after, if only to avoid the prolonged immiseration of Gaza’s population and a resumption of regional hostilities. Hamas’s problem is that even a widened conflict including Iran, Hizbullah and a motley collection of smaller Iran-backed militias would not overcome the fundamental power disparity between Israel and its foes, let alone Palestinians. Moreover, both Iran and Hizbullah, its most powerful proxy, have reasons to avoid escalation. Hizbullah has refrained from engaging in a full-blown conflict with Israel on its northern border since the Hamas attack, though there have been exchanges of fire. Iran’s leaders and senior commanders have reportedly concluded that there is not much they can do, apart from tacitly permitting their country’s proxies to act as they see fit. These prevarications have given Israel time to mobilise an immense army, deploy a large part of it to the Lebanese border, evacuate local towns and buttress its air defences. True, to dismiss the risk of escalation because it would not serve the alleged interests of Hizbullah or Iran could be just another example of the mirror-imaging and wishful thinking that plague policymakers of all stripes—and which contributed to the Israeli blunders that opened the door to Hamas on October 7th. Hamas may yet find fellowship in its self-immolation. Nonetheless, compared to Hamas, Iran and Hizbullah are conventional creatures and can therefore be deterred by the prospect of a punitive Israeli response. Hamas clearly can not. Hence Israel’s conclusion that Hamas must go. This has entailed the sudden reversal of entrenched policy. As Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has explained, Hamas was an essential tool in Israel’s effort to split the Palestinian national movement, weakening the more moderate, West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA). Hamas functioned, perversely, as the loyal opposition to Likud governments. Even Israel’s ultra-right was on board; Bezalel Smotrich, the hardline finance minister, has described the PA as a burden but Hamas as an “asset”. The scale and sadism of Hamas’s rampage on October 7th has made a return to the old arrangement unthinkable for now. Although Hamas is not Islamic State, its participants in the atrocities were weaned on IS’s gruesome videos, which had redefined the culture of jihad. Whatever the precise inspiration, the resulting performance of Wagnerian apocalypticism has now reached its culminating acts of fire and purification. If past were prologue, this process would be interrupted within weeks as the marginal costs exceeded the returns for both sides. This time, the past is merely the past. Israel’s friends, especially America, have expressed concern about its war aims. The Biden administration must worry about regional escalation, and about its own reputation as Palestinian civilian casualties grow. It must also fear an all-out push by Israel that fails to eliminate Hamas but pulverises Gaza and ends in a comprehensive Israeli blockade, a traumatised population, a public-health crisis, warlord rule and a lost generation of Palestinian youth. The question of who rules Gaza if Hamas is toppled, or even crippled, is therefore urgent. There are good reasons to doubt Israel’s ability to dislodge Hamas as the power in Gaza. Its army is not battle-hardened, urban combat is more gruelling than open warfare—and Hamas will have prepared the battlefield to compound the challenge. Toppling Hamas could require a lengthy occupation of Gaza, raising the spectre of an insurgency amid the ruins. On the other hand, Israel’s armed forces are powerful and highly motivated, the war has unified a citizenry riven by political differences just weeks ago, and there is something like a consensus over the need to remove Hamas. Toppling the group—not as a social movement, but as a government and army—is thus at least a plausible aim. Victory, however, could prove pyrrhic—not least if there is no government to replace Hamas. Israel will need to hand responsibility for Gaza to a competent, temporary steward as soon as is practicable. Such a transitional government will have to be formed of a coalition of states and perceived as legitimate and effective, as well as being acceptable to Israel. It will need to be authorised and equipped by the UN to defend itself while administering Gaza’s urgent needs, and it must be ready to enter the territory when the shooting stops. And as it restores order, it must also prepare the ground for reassertion of Palestinian rule through elections in both Gaza and the West Bank. Planning for this will require time and complex diplomacy. The PA, however, is run by a president elected in 2005 and legislature elected in 2006. It is corrupt and widely perceived as a tool of Israeli occupation. It is incapable of stemming Israel’s building of settlements in the West Bank and their occupants’ attacks on Palestinians. Any expectations of a role for the PA in governing a post-conflict Gaza are unrealistic unless these conditions change. Furthermore, Arab states’ participation in a transitional administration will hinge on the promise of Israeli concessions on the West Bank, including a halt to the building or expansion of settlements, curbing violence by settlers and the transfer of some land from mixed Palestinian and Israeli control to the PA. No long-term solution to the problem of Gaza is possible without this. It will require the application of a defibrillator to the peace process, as well as the resumption of Israeli-Saudi normalisation talks. Of the many obstacles to this approach, Israel’s willingness to make concessions is the most formidable. How formidable will depend on what kind of government emerges in Jerusalem after the war. Bernard Avishai, the author of “The Tragedy of Zionism”, believes that “the combination of corruption, fecklessness and extremism of the hard-right government—and especially Netanyahu himself—will be expelled like a hairball from the cat.” A darker view is that the terrible costs of the conflict, global opposition to Israel’s military campaign, tinged as it is in places with antisemitism, the awfulness of October 7th and intensified mistrust of Arabs will push Israelis to continue backing hard-right rule. If so, the dystopia won’t just envelop the Gaza Strip.■ Steven Simon is the professor of practice in Middle Eastern studies at the Jackson School of International Relations, University of Washington, senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and the author of “Grand Delusion: The Rise and Fall of American Ambition in the Middle East” (2023)."
https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/19/israel-turns-to-financial-weapons-as-well-as-military-ones,"In less than a fortnight, some 3,500 Gazans have been killed, 12,000 injured and more than a million displaced—on whose behalf America and the un are attempting to open a passage into Egypt. Entire neighbourhoods in the strip have been bombed to dust. Cut off from food, water and medical supplies, the un warned on October 16th that Gaza’s 2.3m people were on “the verge of an abyss”. Since Israel’s strikes began, war has drained nearly every source of economic life from the territory. For the better part of two decades, Gaza has relied on support from international donors for its financial survival. On October 18th Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said that his country would allow a modest amount of food and medicine across Egypt’s border into the territory, which would be the first supplies let in since Hamas launched its brutal attack against Israel on October 7th. Israel’s allies, including America, are pushing for more to be admitted. Yet at the same time, Israel wants to suffocate Hamas by any means possible, which requires using economic as well as military weapons. Averting a humanitarian catastrophe is made all the more difficult by the miserable pre-war state of the Palestinian economy. Israel, Gaza and the West Bank share a single market, governed by a deal that the un brokered in 1994. The idea behind the agreement was that Palestinians would work in Israel and that Israeli capital would flood into Gaza and the West Bank, where rich returns were waiting. In reality, Israeli restrictions remained in place and the Palestinian economy still depends on handouts. On the eve of the war, the average Israeli was 15 times richer than the average Palestinian. Only a third of West Bankers have access to a sewage system; some 10% manage without a water supply. West Bankers have been allowed to work in low-skilled jobs in Israel, but have been subject to tight restrictions on their movement. In Gaza, things have been even worse. Growth in gdp per person in the West Bank averaged 2.8% a year from 2007 to 2022. The average Gazan became poorer during the same period, with the local economy shrinking by 2.5% a year. The territory has operated under a near total blockade from Israel since Hamas took power in 2007. Until recently, it was supplied with electricity by Israel, but received only a third of the amount it sought. Each of the three wars fought between the two sides—in 2008, 2014 and 2021—cost Gaza the equivalent of at least a year of gdp. If there is nothing for an economy to generate, it is not just growth that suffers. Unemployment is rife. More than half of the Gazan adult population were living below the imf’s poverty line in 2021. There are few ways to make money. One way used to be dealing imports and exports through tunnels under Gaza’s southern border, but Egypt cleared out most after a bust-up with Hamas in 2014. Another way is to rebuild what war destroys. One of Gaza’s main businesses is construction, which grew by 20% last year. It will presumably grow by more once this round of war ends. Others cobble together incomes from a range of outside sources. Some 70,000 Gazans remain on the payroll of the Palestinian Authority (PA), even though its officials who run the West Bank were kicked out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, and none of them actually goes to work. Qatar deposits cash—some $10m a month—into the bank accounts of thousands more locals. The PA pays Gaza’s electricity bills, which Israel subtracts from the tax it collects on behalf of the PA in the West Bank. The un educates 300,000 Gazan children; a network of hospitals it runs with charities provides the territory with basic health care. Another organisation on which Gazans depend is Hamas, whose administrative branch runs the strip’s government. Since it took power, Hamas has expanded the public payroll from roughly 20,000 to 50,000 civil servants. Last year its spending contributed 0.8% to gdp growth, compared with 0.3% from all household and business spending. As charities run so many of the strip’s schools and hospitals, and the PA keeps the lights on, Hamas is able to spend lavishly elsewhere. It finances its spending with an adroit tax system. Though Gaza gets no imports from Israel, it does get them from Egypt, from which trade had recently increased, and the West Bank. Hamas taxes food and fuel crossing the Egyptian border; picks up 16.5% of the value of products from baby food to jeans; charges three shekels ($0.75) per kilo of fish caught by fishermen; and levies income tax. Altogether economists reckon that Hamas may take in somewhere in the region of 1.5bn shekels a year. Other sources of finance are already in Israel’s sights. Gaza’s various Islamist groups receive maybe $100m a year from Iran, according to America’s best guess. Hamas also receives individual donations from the Gulf and the West, some of which are furtively transferred across borders using cryptocurrencies. Israel and its allies have already come down hard on these sources of finance where possible, freezing accounts in Istanbul and London. Will aid to Gaza end up strengthening the position of Hamas? In the past, Israel has been wary of multilateral organisations working in the strip. Other governments have found that links between charities and Hamas are rare, however. In Gaza, few believe rumours that Hamas taxes aid. So grim is the situation that “a few bits of fuel getting lost is worth it”, argues the boss of a think-tank in Gaza. Israeli policymakers also face dilemmas in the West Bank. Just a few thousand Gazans work in Israel; in contrast, a quarter of the West Bank’s labour force works over the border or in Jewish settlements. Israel does allow exports and imports through the West Bank—the duties on which make up around two-thirds of the PA’s budget. These taxes are collected by Israel and occasionally held up for months at a time before being transferred. Some Israeli officials reportedly want to cut such payments, either to redirect money towards Gazan reconstruction or in the hopes of stopping payments to Gazan families. Other Israeli officials insist that the PA needs more, not less, funding in order to keep a fragile peace. In some ways, the choices facing Israeli politicians are exaggerated versions of ones that they have faced in the past. When Israel wanted to contain Hamas, it made no sense to help the group collect taxes. Now that Israel wants to destroy Hamas, it makes no sense in military terms to allow supplies into Gaza. Yet if it restricts the flow of supplies even more harshly, a humanitarian disaster will ensue. On October 17th Gaza’s health ministry begged for generators. Without them, it said, hospitals were about to shut down. ■ For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/10/david-enoch-argues-that-much-of-the-public-discourse-on-the-israel-hamas-conflict-is-depressingly-simplistic,"THE MORALITY of war is extremely complicated. So, consequently, are the ethics of commenting on it. But in the war in Israel and Gaza, some things are simple: the horrendous atrocities committed by Hamas cannot be justified, under any circumstances. Another simple fact is that many Palestinians in Gaza are entirely innocent, victims of both Israel and Hamas, and are suffering a horrible calamity. It is highly disconcerting that these two simple facts are in need of emphasising, but there are plenty who are happy to offer pseudo-sophisticated ways of denying at least one of them. Even when it comes to the morality of the war effort itself, some things are clear: Israel has not just the right to defend itself, but a duty to its citizens to protect them against the threats Hamas (and others) pose. Just as clearly: even in the pursuit of a just war, civilians must not be targeted. And when harm to innocents is a necessary and foreseeable result of legitimate attacks on combatants, in order to be morally acceptable it must be proportionate to the harm the military operation is intended to prevent. Some of the underlying principles of the morality of war are, then, straightforward enough. (Not all, by the way: for instance, it is not at all clear whether a state using force should be neutral between harm to its own civilians and harm to the enemy’s, and if it shouldn’t, how much priority it should give to its own people.) But what follows from this as far as real-life conflicts are concerned is an extremely complicated matter, about which most of us don’t have anything like the level of information needed to draw conclusions with any confidence. What are the dangers to its civilians that Israel is now fighting to eliminate? How likely are future attacks—from Hamas, from Hizbullah, from others—to be attempted? To succeed? Are there alternative measures available to Israel that would result in less harm to innocents? (And no, ending the occupation, morally crucial though it is, is not an alternative measure feasibly available to Israel at this moment as a way of defending its citizens.) How do Hamas tactics, including the use of Palestinian civilians as “human shields”, affect the morbid but indispensable proportionality calculus? How much value should be placed on deterrence, and how can Israel restore a significant deterrence effect after the unbelievable intelligence failures of October 7th? What can Israel do to free the hostages Hamas (and perhaps others in Gaza) continue to hold? Nothing at all can be responsibly said about what Israel should and should not do right now without at least partial answers to these complex questions. Even well-intended calls for an immediate ceasefire do not escape this fate, for it is far from obvious that a ceasefire is consistent with Israel’s duty to defend its citizens (or even just to free its hostages). Calls for an immediate ceasefire are entirely understandable: given the magnitude of the devastation in Gaza, as well as continued threats to Israelis, any decent person may feel a strong desire that it should all just stop. But such a wish, understandable though it is, is not the basis for sound policy. And if you think that a call for a ceasefire is justified, given factual uncertainties, as a way of erring on the side of safety, you should remember that when it comes to war, often there is no side of safety. Any mistakes—using too much force, not using enough—will be paid for in the only relevant currency, the blood of innocents. It may be hoped that decision-makers have more information than the rest of us do, and that they give appropriate weight in their deliberations to the relevant moral constraints. But it can hardly be denied that in many of its policy actions over many years prior to October 7th, and in some of its current official and unofficial statements, Israel has rightfully earned the distrust of many—myself included. What is a conscientious public intellectual to do? Surely we must have something to say about a horrible tragedy that is unfolding in front of our eyes? Indeed, philosophers and other intellectuals have chimed in, not just as individuals, but also in groups. In one such intervention, 45 academics from the University of Oxford wrote an open letter condemning Israel and calling on Britain’s political leaders to urge an immediate ceasefire, without so much as a gesture in the direction of the uncertainties involved. In another public text, signed mostly by North-America-based academic philosophers, anti-colonialist jargon was lifted unmodified from the nice-sounding-slogans shelf and applied with no sensitivity to any of the facts relevant here. Intellectuals should comment on public affairs, and it’s okay if they sometimes do it in a way that is not quite as nuanced as their next academic publication. But when they do, they should highlight complexities, not hide them. They may be experts on some of the general principles of the morality of war, but if they do not appreciate how fact-sensitive any application of that knowledge to real-world scenarios is always bound to be, then they do not after all know the first thing about their subject matter. When public intellectuals make confident but factually unfounded proclamations on such matters, they degrade their respective fields, and to the extent that they have an effect in the real world they risk taking part in bringing about disastrous policies. In short, they betray their role as intellectuals, serving to fuel legitimate doubts about how much they know or care about the real world, indeed about real people. Perhaps moral philosophers can contribute to public discourse even now—for instance, in thinking about how decisions should be made given the tremendous uncertainty involved, or to insist on the relevance of some neglected considerations. Or perhaps we should confess that we, too, are embarrassed, that we cannot be confident just what to say. Depending on your expectations, this may be disappointing. But unlike many of the other interventions in today’s public discourse, such a response would at least be honest. And probably less harmful as well.

https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/10/10/the-crisis-shows-the-failure-of-israeli-policy-towards-palestinians-says-shlomo-brom,"Israel is facing an unprecedented crisis. The state that was founded to protect Jews from persecution failed miserably in protecting its citizens living near the Gaza Strip. It was completely surprised by a militarily inferior adversary. The small Israel Defence Forces (IDF) contingent deployed along Israel’s border with Gaza crumbled and could not prevent the butchering of almost a thousand people, most of them civilians, and the taking as hostages of scores of other citizens by Palestinian terrorists from Hamas. Nobody knows how the situation will develop. The fighting has only just started. The IDF is reorganising its forces along the border and mopping up Hamas forces that crossed from Gaza into Israeli territory. At the same time it is bombing targets in Gaza linked to Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group. The aim is to destroy their military capabilities and to make them pay a high cost for the recent atrocities without recourse to ground operations. Israel’s civilian population, meanwhile, fears further rocket attacks from the Palestinian organisations after a barrage at the weekend and more strikes on Monday. Read more on this story:After its brutal attack, Hamas is calculating its next moveHamas’s carnage upends Joe Biden’s plans for the Middle EastThe lessons from Hamas’s assault on IsraelIsraeli hostages now face a terrifying ordeal This is the usual pattern of Israeli reaction to attacks from the Gaza Strip, but this time it will not be enough. Public frustration and anger are at unprecedented levels. Many accuse the government and the armed forces of negligence and betrayal of their duties, and are demanding drastic military action that will “once and for all” end the threat from the Palestinians in Gaza. The government is unlikely to be able to absorb this pressure without launching major operations in the Gaza Strip that include an extensive ground offensive. These might even lead to reoccupation of the territory, with all the costs in human life that implies. That, in turn, could drag Israel into a wider conflict with the so-called “axis of resistance” that includes not only the Gaza-based groups but also Hizbullah, a Lebanon-based militia, Iran and Syria. The political implications are broad, too. Israel’s government is in a fragile situation. There are demands for resignations of senior officials. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and his government might be “saved” by elements in the opposition that wish to form a unity government with him for the purpose of dealing with this crisis. Regardless of the level of opposition support in the short term, however, the crisis may deal a fatal blow to Mr Netanyahu’s political career as public calls for accountability grow. Israel was led to this grim situation by the failure of its policies towards the Palestinians. When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, two years after the IDF had pulled its forces out, the Israeli government faced a choice between two viable political and military strategies. The first involved adapting to a reality in which Hamas was one of the two major political factions in the Palestinian territories—the other being Fatah, based in the West Bank. Any Israeli government that genuinely wished to end the conflict with the Palestinians would then have striven to include Hamas in the bilateral political process alongside its Fatah rivals. That would have required Israel to enter into direct talks with Hamas while supporting reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. The other option was to adopt a strategy of consistently weakening Hamas and strengthening the Palestinian Authority run by Fatah. That would have had to include a credible political process aimed at a permanent status agreement, possibly achieved through a series of smaller agreements and unilateral steps. These two options had their weaknesses and potential costs, but since the end of the government led by Ehud Olmert, in 2009, successive Israeli administrations have chosen neither of them. Mr Olmert had tried the second strategy for some time but was forced to resign before achieving any of his goals. Mr Netanyahu subsequently adopted a third strategy that was bound to fail. In 2009 Mr Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he declared his acceptance of a Palestinian state with several conditions. Despite this, he abandoned the political process with the Palestinians, eventually making it clear that he opposed the establishment of a Palestinian state. He replaced the political process with a strategy of “divide-and-conquer”, which was aimed at weakening the Palestinian government in Ramallah on the West Bank and strengthening Hamas’s hold on power in the Gaza Strip. Mr Netanyahu believed this to be the best way to ensure that no viable political process would be possible. The prime minister took this policy to a new level in building his current government: a coalition with extreme religious, ultra-nationalistic parties, which stated quite openly that Israel would never enable the establishment of a Palestinian state, give equal rights to the Palestinians under a one-state solution or stop the plundering of their lands through settlement-building. This policy led to most of the Israeli army being deployed to protect Jewish settlers in the West Bank, at the expense of protecting the border around the Gaza Strip. The current crisis demonstrates the utter failure of this strategy. It is absurd to hope that Israel can indefinitely contain with its military might and security services millions of Palestinians who claim the right to self-determination and a free, normal life. Eventually the oppressed will rise against their oppressor. Suffering under oppression and a strong desire for freedom breed resourcefulness. The Hamas fighters who planned last weekend’s attack were indeed very resourceful in exploiting Israel’s unpreparedness. Eventually, Israel will have to make a choice between the two-state solution and a single state with equal rights for all of its inhabitants—and strive to make whichever it chooses work.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/22/israels-window-of-legitimacy-in-gaza-is-shrinking,"On Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, in the Upper Galilee, the air is heavy with acrid smoke as shelling ignites forest fires. Civilians have been evacuated and soldiers in helmets guard the junctions. Every hour or so, Hizbullah missiles explode inside the border, and Israel launches a counter-barrage aimed at the Iran-backed militia. This is a country poised for war. To the east Israel is bombing Syrian airfields thought to be used to ship arms to militants. To the west an American aircraft-carrier strike group floats in the Mediterranean, with a second on its way to the region, to try to deter Iran and its proxies. In the south a vast Israeli invasion force awaits an order to enter the battle grounds of Gaza. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Fifteen days after Hamas’s attack on Israel, that ground invasion has yet to begin. One reason for the delay is a desperate flurry of last-minute diplomacy. On October 20th two American-Israeli hostages were released by Hamas after talks brokered by Qatar. A day later an international conference in Cairo called for a cease-fire. A limited amount of aid is now flowing across from Egypt into Gaza and negotiations over more hostage releases are ongoing. The delay also reflects debate within Israel’s government about what kind of war it wants to fight: hard and fast, or patient and long? On October 19th field commanders finalised operational plans and the war cabinet met in Tel Aviv. After seven hours, the meeting chaired by Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, ended inconclusively. Strained relationships and stress may be impeding decision making. The impetuous defence minister, Yoav Gallant, supported by some generals, wants to rush into another short, sharp war. Mr Netanyahu is chronically hesitant. But Israel is also under pressure from allies to recalibrate its plans and move away from its customary approach of rapid shock-and-awe offensives to a more restrained, longer campaign. On October 22nd Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, said US military advice to Israel was “focused on both how they do it and how best to achieve the results that they seek” while acknowledging that “Hamas is an active threat and that needs to be dealt with”. Every Israeli war is fought watching the clock, as international condemnation grows and eventually America qualifies its support. In 1973 America urged a ceasefire ending the Yom Kippur War despite Israeli forces being on the advance. In 2006, it imposed a ceasefire before Israel could achieve its objectives in Lebanon. As one Israeli official puts it, “our window of international legitimacy is limited.” That usually points towards using maximum force to inflict punitive damage and re-establish deterrence fast before the window closes. This time may be different. Israel’s stated aim is expansive: to destroy Hamas’s capabilities and remove it from power. That means laboriously clearing a 500km labyrinth of tunnels and house-to-house fighting.  One general involved says “to completely eliminate Hamas’ capabilities to launch rockets you must eliminate the rocket operators”, who often fire from civilian buildings. In 2016-17 it took Iraq, with help from a coalition, nine months to destroy Daesh in Mosul, a city of 2m people before it was occupied. America also appears to want a longer, more restrained campaign. Optically Mr Biden could not be more supportive of Mr Netanyahu’s government. “I am a Zionist,” he told the war cabinet on his visit to Israel. The president is asking Congress for a $105bn emergency funding bill that includes $14bn for Israel, and America continues to build up forces in the region: on October 21st it said it would deploy additional Patriot air-defence battalions and a THAAD anti-ballistic missile battery. Mr Biden is also giving diplomatic cover: on October 18th America vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for a “humanitarian pause” and on October 21st it proposed one asserting Israel’s right to self defence. Nonetheless the White House is also clear it expects Israel to comply with the laws of war and to minimise civilian casualties. Mr Biden has urged Israel that “while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it”. Finally Israel’s war cabinet may be weighing the response in the Arab world. A very rapid further rise in civilian casualties in Gaza would be more likely to trigger a response from Hizbullah and Iran, and the second front that Israel dreads. On October 19th, the launch of missiles towards Israel from Iranian-backed militants in Yemen served as a reminder of the explosive potential of Iran’s various proxies (they were intercepted by the American navy). As importantly it would lead to a deeper estrangement with the Arab states with whom Israel had improving ties before the attacks on October 7th, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Saudi has implicitly kept normalisation of diplomatic relations on the table. A more controlled, longer campaign would still carry huge risks for Israel. Its forces could get bogged down: in 2014 soldiers got trapped in Shujaiyeh in northern Gaza and had to be protected by heavy artillery. Eado Hecht, an Israeli military analyst, has warned of 40,000 fighters from Hamas and other groups who will “conduct a deadly game of hide-and-seek with our forces for a long time”. Prolonged mobilisation will hurt the economy: the reservists are a large proportion of the workforce, as are hundreds of thousands of Israelis who have had to evacuate the areas near Gaza and along the border with Lebanon. After long periods of national mobilisation in the wars of 1973 and 1982, the country suffered prolonged recession. The best way to try to extend Israel’s “window of legitimacy” with its Western and Arab allies would be to signal that it is prepared to participate in some kind of plan for the Palestinians if it succeeds in removing Hamas. On October 21st Mr Biden tweeted “we cannot give up on a two-state solution”. Gaza would need a credible Palestinian administration, with the backing of Arab nations, in order to rebuild and ensure Hamas does not return. Here Mr Netanyahu, who is fighting for his political survival, is doing his country no favours by denying, as he did on October 21st, that the preferred long-term solution for Gaza is to re-establish the control of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which rules in the West Bank and has condemned the Hamas attacks. Mr Netanyahu is the architect of the two-decade strategy of ignoring and isolating the Palestinians, and dividing them between Hamas-ruled Gaza and the West Bank run by a weakened PA. That failed approach is one of the reasons Israel is about to go to war against Hamas. Israel’s lack of a plan for the Palestinians could also now compromise its ability to sustain a long campaign.■"

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/07/israel-reels-as-hamas-launches-a-spectacular-and-bloody-offensive,"ISRAELIS WOKE on October 7th, Simchat Torah, the Jewish festival which celebrates the end of the yearly cycle of reading the Torah, to a hail of more than 2,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians’ tiny coastal enclave. But soon reports began filtering through of a much more devastating attack. Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist organisation which runs Gaza, had launched a series of attacks within Israel. The fortified border fence between Israel and Gaza was breached by trucks and bulldozers laden with explosives while fighters in motorised gliders flew over the fence. Hamas fighters also used boats to attack an Israeli coastal base.The footage of the attacks, shared by both Hamas and Israeli citizens on social media, was shocking for Israelis hunkered down in their bomb-shelters who are used to their military dominance. Videos showed Palestinian fighters in jeeps and on motorcycles firing on civilians on the streets of small Israeli towns and kibbutzim near Gaza. Shooting was reported within the Israeli military’s main divisional headquarters for Gaza. Palestinian militants killed and wounded dozens at a music festival. As civilians, off-duty soldiers and police officers battled on their own, special-forces units were being rushed south. In the evening of October 7th, Israel’s emergency rescue service said that at least 200 had been killed. Even more worrying for Israelis are the videos published by Hamas of captured Israeli soldiers and civilians being hustled across the border into Gaza. Hours after the attacks began, Israel’s chief military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, acknowledged that the fighting was still continuing and said that Israeli authorities were working on the assumption that members of Hamas were still in Israel in the area close to the border with Gaza. Read more on this story: “We are at war,” announced Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, in a statement to the nation. It was not, he continued, a military operation or an exchange of fire, but war. Mr Netanyahu promised that Israel will “return fire of a magnitude that the enemy has not known. The enemy will pay an unprecedented price.” Israeli defence officials said that they had ordered dozens of air strikes in response. Those immediate strikes killed at least 198 and injured more than 1,600, Palestinian officials said. But a much larger operation is being planned for the coming days. Thousands of reservists were called up to their units; the scale suggests Israel is preparing for a large offensive. Gadi Shamni, a retired Israeli general, said that “this time we have to get to [Hamas leaders] Yihya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif”. Israel has targeted them in previous operations but they have emerged unscathed. This attack—and the expected wider Israeli response—are on a different scale from those of recent years. The 11-day war between Israel and Gaza in May 2021 was seen by Israelis as a “miscalculation” on the part of Hamas. The other three large flare-ups between Israel and Gaza in recent years involved Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a much smaller militia, and ended within a few days. Israeli policy meanwhile has been to gradually alleviate the closure of Gaza, allowing 20,000 day labourers to work in Israel and bring in much needed cash. Israeli officials are already saying that the attack will mean that any policies aimed at easing the living situations in Gaza will be frozen for a long time. Mr Shamni predicted that Gaza would be “set back decades”. So far, however, Hamas has been jubilant. “We showed that Israel is…not a strong country, we can defeat them, we can stop them with small groups of brigades, not an army,” said Ghazi Hamad, a spokesman for the movement. Hamas says that its operation is a response to Israeli “attacks” on the Al-Aqsa compound on Temple Mount in Jerusalem. There have, however, been no major disturbances there in recent days. More likely Hamas’s attack is part of a direct challenge for leadership of the Palestinian people. It is an attempt to show the Palestinians that there is an alternative to the strategy of non-violence and focus on diplomacy pursued by the elderly President Mahmoud Abbas, which has failed to yield results. A useful side-effect in Hamas’s eyes would be a derailment of the increasing engagement between Israel and Arab countries, including most recently Saudi Arabia. Mr Hamad added that “normalisation is a great shame, it is a knife in the back of Palestinians. I think all Arab countries must stop normalisation.” Either way it is impossible to exaggerate the scale of Israel’s intelligence failure in anticipating and preparing for this assault. For many Israelis, it was a chilling reminder of the Yom Kippur war, when Egypt and Syria took Israel by surprise in a co-ordinated attack on the most holy day on the Jewish calendar. That attack took place on October 6th 1973, 50 years and a day ago. This incursion by Hamas, using a variety of tactics, would have taken at least months of training, planning and procuring weapons and equipment. Israel’s surveillance of the beleaguered coastal strip is intense. All phone and internet communications from Gaza are on Israeli infrastructure. This is not simply a failure of intelligence collection and analysis. It is a conceptual failure too. In recent years the Israeli defence establishment’s working assumption has been that the dominant forces within the Hamas leadership in Gaza had decided to refrain from wide-scale confrontation with Israel and to focus on bolstering their rule in the strip, which they seized from the rival, Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority in a bloody coup in 2007. The implications of Saturday morning’s attack will be dire for Israel. Its military deterrence has been tarnished by scenes of Palestinian fighters roaming freely through Israeli kibbutzim and the town of Sderot. It will be a major boost to other regional actors such as Hizbullah, the Iranian-supported Shia movement in Lebanon, which is currently hosting leaders of Hamas who are not in Gaza or the West Bank in Beirut and may have had a hand in the planning. Within Israel, this will raise serious questions over Mr Netanyahu’s leadership after a turbulent nine months since he returned to office, during which his far-right government has tried to push through a deeply controversial programme of constitutional reform. Mr Netanyahu’s supporters will try to blame the intelligence community. Many of its members are reserve officers who have been active in the protest movement against the government in recent months and have called on fellow reservists not to turn up for service. While the fighting continues Mr Netanyahu’s opponents are refraining from criticising but they will not remain silent forever. In recent weeks, all talk in the Middle East was of the advanced talks towards a historic deal to establish diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. It is too early to say how the negotiations may be affected; the Saudis are no fans of Hamas. But the morning raids on Israel are a stark reminder that peace on its border is still a distant prospect.■"
https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/02/can-israeli-emirati-business-ties-survive-the-gaza-war,"IN 2020 MIDDLE EASTERN commerce was transformed. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and a few other countries signed the Abraham Accords with Israel, normalising relations between the Jewish state and some of its Arab neighbours. Israeli tourists flooded into Dubai on the first ever direct flights. In the first eight months of 2023 Dubai welcomed almost 230,000 travellers from Israel, 73% more than in the same period last year. Nowadays travel agencies in Tel Aviv even offer bar-mitzvah tours in the emirate, with pit stops at kosher restaurants. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Business dealings have blossomed, too. The UAE-Israel Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement came into force in April. Official trade between the two countries is expected to surpass $3bn this year, from nothing in 2019. Last year Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, reportedly invested $100m in six venture-capital (VC) funds based in Israel or focused on Israeli startups. It also bought a $1bn stake in an offshore natural-gas field from NewMed Energy of Israel. Israeli technology companies such as Liquidity Group, a fintech darling, have opened research-and-development centres in the UAE. Israeli and Emirati universities have forged research partnerships on things like artificial intelligence. All of this progress is now at risk as a result of the war raging between Israel and Hamas. Since the conflict erupted, reports one Israeli entrepreneur, many Emirati contacts have gone silent. An Israeli-American investor who splits his time between Dubai and Tel Aviv worries that even after the conflict abates, Arab firms will think twice about transacting with Israeli ones. That would be unwelcome for Israel and the UAE alike. Israeli business confidence was slumping even before the hostilities in Gaza. Proposed reforms to weaken the supreme court worried corporate bosses. Amid a worldwide VC winter, Israeli startups raised less than $4bn in the first half of 2023, the lowest since the same period in 2018. More than two-fifths of Israeli companies surveyed in late October reported that their prospective backers had cancelled or delayed investment agreements. Israel’s businesses could therefore use the UAE’s deep pools of capital and access to its domestic market, especially as their country recovers from hostilities that are, according to surveys, already affecting four in five of its tech firms. The UAE, for its part, covets Israeli know-how, which could accelerate the country’s economic diversification away from oil and help it keep up with competition from its bigger neighbour, Saudi Arabia, itself in the throes of a modernisation drive (and, until the Gaza war, on course to forge diplomatic ties with Israel). In the past decade private investment in the UAE has declined as a share of GDP. Although the government has put in place various incentives for entrepreneurs, from accelerator programmes to credit guarantees, the IMF has recently pointed to the “weak technology content” of the Emirati economy. Most new tech ventures end up looking like copycats of stale e-commerce businesses. Israel, with its keen technological acumen in areas from digital technology to water desalination and a culture of free enterprise, has a lot to teach the Emiratis. The commercial logic of continued rapprochement, then, remains sound. Many businesspeople in Israel and the UAE know it—and are hoping that the current pause is just that, rather than a collapse. ■ To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/05/14/americas-democrats-are-increasingly-divided-over-israel,"UNTIL THE Middle East forced itself onto his agenda this week, President Joe Biden has had good reason to avoid the pursuit of peacemaking there that occupied so many of his predecessors: not only does he want to focus on China, but the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has become the foreign-policy question that most sharply divides Democrats. This intra-party disagreement is breaking out into the open as violence intensifies in the region, with Hamas raining rockets on Israeli cities, Israeli forces bombarding the Gaza Strip, and communal unrest spreading to Israel’s cities. About 130 people, mostly Palestinians, have died since the fighting erupted on May 10th. The Democrats’ ascendant progressive wing has no patience for the party’s traditional bedrock support for Israel, a position long held by Mr Biden. On Wednesday the White House issued a statement summarising a call between Mr Biden and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. In keeping with such boilerplate statements by previous administrations of both parties, this one emphasised “Israel’s legitimate right to defend itself”. Progressives erupted. Ilhan Omar, a Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, tallied the Palestinian children killed to that point—13—and mocked Mr Biden’s claims to be putting human rights at the centre of his foreign policy. “You aren’t prioritizing human rights,” she tweeted. “You’re siding with an oppressive occupation.” Another progressive congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, echoed that accusation and wrote that such statements “dehumanize Palestinians”. In previous days Ms Omar had taken to Twitter to accuse Israel of “terrorism” and “ethnic cleansing”—language that would have been astonishing coming from an elected Democrat just a few years ago. The fighting has sharpened calls from some Democrats to put conditions on aid that America supplies to Israel. “Why are US tax dollars being used to fuel the repression, violence, and persecution of Palestinians?” asked Betty McCollum, the sponsor of a House bill to restrict such assistance, in an interview with Jewish Currents, a progressive journal. This year America is supplying Israel with $3.9bn in aid, almost all of it military assistance; Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of American aid, at $146bn, since the second world war. Mr Biden has shown no interest in applying that kind of pressure to Israel. During his presidential campaign, he called the notion of putting any conditions on aid, proposed by the progressive candidate Bernie Sanders, “bizarre”. Mr Biden also reportedly intervened during the campaign to prevent Mr Sanders and his allies from including the word “occupation” in the portion of the Democratic Party’s platform that touched on Middle East policy. While the left was pushing one way, Mr Biden, then as now, was also under pressure from the right. Bidding for Jewish and evangelical voters, his opponent, President Donald Trump, tilted American policy sharply towards Israel and went so far as to accuse American Jews who support Democrats, as the vast majority do, of “either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty”. President Biden’s views of the Middle East conflict are squarely in line with what, pre-Trump, had been the bipartisan establishment consensus in America for decades. Mr Biden supports a two-state solution, and he has been trying as president to return America to its traditional aspiration to serve an honest broker between the antagonists. He has restored aid to the Palestinians that Mr Trump eliminated. His aides are being careful now to call on both sides to de-escalate. That said, Mr Biden has not been trying very hard. President Barack Obama named a special envoy for Middle East peace on his second full day in office. Mr Biden has named several special envoys, but none for that purpose. He has not yet appointed an ambassador to Israel. He has also not fulfilled a campaign promise to re-establish the American consulate in Jerusalem, which historically functioned as a shadow embassy to the Palestinians. On Mr Trump’s orders that consulate was absorbed into the actual embassy. Mr Biden’s lack of urgency about the Middle East has reflected his foreign-policy priorities, and also reality: neither side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is in much shape to negotiate. After four inconclusive elections in two years, Israelis are struggling to form a government, while the Palestinians, factionalised, are adrift. But turning his attention to Asia has also allowed Mr Biden, until now, to avoid heightening intra-party tensions when he needs Democratic unity to pursue his domestic priorities. “The biggest area of disagreement in Democratic foreign policy, without question, is Israel,” said Matt Bennett, executive vice-president at Third Way, a centrist think-tank. Many influences are at work in the progressives’ assessment of Israel. The Holocaust is fading from living memory, and the rising generation of Democrats knows Israel not as a fragile, isolated nation but as the region’s pre-eminent power, the only one with nuclear arms. Despite the departure of Israeli settlers from Gaza, the relentless expansion of settlements in the West Bank has made Israel, to them, seem like a colonial state; its denial of rights to Palestinians has drawn comparisons with apartheid from such credible sources as Human Rights Watch. Questions of racial injustice that are dominating America’s domestic political debate appear to have a parallel in Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and of its own Arab citizens. Progressives also watched as Mr Netanyahu identified Israel’s interests with those of the Republican Party, first seeking Republican support in an attempt to block Mr Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran and then embracing Mr Trump. The sheer length of the occupation is a key factor, says Jodi Rudoren, the editor of the Forward, a long-running Jewish publication, and a former New York Times bureau chief in Jerusalem. “It becomes harder and harder to take a position that is pro-Israel and pro-human-rights and pro-a-two-state-solution when there’s been a stalemate for more than 50 years,” she says. At the same time, the polarisation of the American media and the power of social platforms have made it easier to advance only one version of a tangled story. “The left is talking only about the human-rights issue, and the right is talking only about Israel’s security,” Ms Rudoren said. “It seems to me terribly troubling that elected officials and activists increasingly ignore one side and the incredible complexity of this conflict.”. Yet beyond its ally in the White House, Israel retains strong bipartisan support in Congress. Last month an overwhelming majority of House members signed a letter to the leaders of the House Appropriations Committee urging them to permit no conditions on aid to Israel. That may be a lagging indicator of political reality, however. A Gallup poll in March showed that, although 75% of Americans felt favourably toward Israel, sympathy for the Palestinians was rising. A majority of Democrats—53%, a jump of ten points since 2018—favoured putting more pressure on Israel than on the Palestinians to resolve the conflict. Should the Middle East conflict continue to escalate, so will the one within the Democratic Party."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/24/how-has-israels-commercial-airspace-remained-open,"SINCE THE bloody attack on Israel on October 7th, roughly 90% of airlines flying to Israel, including British Airways and Emirates, have suspended flights to the country. Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip, has repeatedly fired rockets at Ben-Gurion airport, Israel’s largest, near Tel Aviv. On October 9th one landed nearby, sending travellers scrambling for cover. Yet Israeli airports, including Ben-Gurion, continue to operate. Why and how have they stayed open? Israel needs its airports, particularly now. In preparation for a ground offensive in Gaza it has called up army reservists, some of whom were abroad. Airlines are also ferrying in diplomats and negotiators. A high proportion of Israel’s cargo, from hospital equipment to supplies for the war effort, arrives by air. Stopping flights would dent morale and represent an apparent capitulation to Hamas. During a conflict in 2014 America’s Federal Aviation Administration suspended flights to Ben-Gurion, a decision condemned by many politicians in America and Israel. The order was rescinded within 36 hours. Grounding civilian flights, says an Israeli aviation official, would be like “closing our only oxygen line”. Yet the threat of strikes on aircraft is real. Hamas recently unveiled its first locally produced anti-aircraft missile, Mutabar-1. It is not yet viable against commercial flights, given that its range is probably 8km or less. But the group’s ground-attack rockets fly further. Since 2011, Israel has been protected from most of them by Iron Dome, its missile-interceptor system. But in that period, the range of Hamas rockets has increased from roughly 20km to 170km, says Yossi Kuperwasser, a retired brigadier-general and former director-general of Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs, putting airports in range. In the past, to conserve pricey interceptors, rockets that were expected to land in unpopulated areas were not usually shot down. Now, says Mr Kuperwasser, if an airport is nearby, interceptors are launched to limit panic among travellers. Before the recent conflict, civilian aircraft had already kept at least 80km from Gaza. Airlines have adjusted their routes further in recent days. Flights from America and Europe bound for Ben-Gurion now take a northerly route, entering Israeli airspace just south of Haifa before banking southwest to reach the airport from the north, says Gideon Mendelson of the Israeli Air Line Pilots Association. This reduces the number of planes over heavily populated areas where rockets are most likely to fly. In recent years Israel has increased the integration of its civilian and military air-traffic control, with controllers in the same operations rooms using shared radar screens. Staff now have more warning before a potential strike on an airliner, usually at least 90 seconds. That is enough to give pilots “a calm, simple instruction” for an evasive manoeuvre, says the aviation official. The new flight routes also give pilots more time to direct their aircraft away from approaching rockets. To increase safety, Israel’s Civil Aviation Authority has told airlines to carry more fuel. Some Ben-Gurion-bound planes have been put in holding patterns for almost 50 minutes due to rocket fire. The extra fuel has prevented the need for emergency landings at other airports. The time airliners spend at Israeli airports has also been shortened, often from 90 minutes or so to less than an hour, by speeding up cleaning and refuelling. All flights to and from Ben-Gurion have been moved to the airport’s newest terminal, which has more bomb shelters and was built to better withstand rocket strikes. The weeks ahead will be trying. Israeli airlines and some foreign carriers, including Etihad, the United Arab Emirates’ flag carrier, and Air Serbia are still operating flights to the country. But most airlines that suspended flights after October 7th are yet to resume them. In recent days some flights to Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, have been cancelled due to shelling between Israel and Hizbullah, in southern Lebanon. If the Iran-backed militia is drawn into the fighting on a large scale, the danger will increase. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has hundreds, if not thousands of rockets that can hit Ben-Gurion. ■"
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/as-israels-invasion-of-gaza-nears-the-obstacles-get-more-daunting,"FOR THE first time in more than 40 years, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have called up their entire armoured corps, thought to number more than 1,000 tanks. Fully 360,000 reservists have also been mustered, including a civil-defence force of 20,000 people. The additional manpower is intended to bolster the IDF’s full-time personnel, of roughly 170,000. Although some of these troops are deployed along Israel’s northern border, to ward off a potential attack from Lebanon by the militants of Hizbullah, more are massing in the south, near the Gaza Strip. Israel is poised to begin what is expected to be its biggest military operation since the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Its leaders have said they are determined to destroy Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, in retaliation for its bloodthirsty rampage across southern Israel on October 7th. As The Economist went to press, no assault had materialised. The most obvious reason for the delay was the brief visit to Israel on October 18th of Joe Biden, America’s president. His presence was intended both to show support for Israel and to try to broker some sort of agreement to help Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza. As it happened, just as Mr Biden was boarding Air Force One on October 17th to head to the region, a deadly explosion racked a hospital in Gaza. The territory’s health ministry said that hundreds of people had been killed. Hamas blamed bombing by the IDF. Israel said a rocket fired by another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, had malfunctioned and fallen on the hospital compound. Analysis of images and video footage by independent researchers suggested that Israel’s explanation was more plausible. The IDF also released tracking data on rocket launches and intercepted communications among Palestinians that appeared to bear out its account. Palestinian rockets are built in makeshift workshops in Gaza to Iranian designs. Mid-air malfunctions are common: the IDF claims that of over 7,000 rockets fired at Israel since October 7th, at least 450 have fallen within Gaza. Israel points out that the images of the explosion’s aftermath show a charred car park at the centre of the hospital compound, and lots of damage to adjacent buildings, but no crater or structural devastation of the sort that would be expected from the munitions it uses in air strikes. Mr Biden backed Israel’s version of events. American officials cited their own infra-red satellite data and intercepts as evidence. But the tragedy nonetheless scotched his hopes of reaching a sweeping deal with Arab leaders to get aid into Gaza and at least some civilians out, despite Israel’s blockade of the territory. Any agreement depends on the acquiescence of Egypt, with which Gaza has a short border and where deliveries of food and medical equipment are piling up. But the carnage at the Ahli Arab hospital caused such outrage in the Arab world that Jordan quickly cancelled a summit where Mr Biden was to meet Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, and Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA). “There is no point in doing anything at this time other than stopping this war,” said Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister. In the end the best Mr Biden could do was secure an Israeli pledge not to obstruct aid deliveries and an Egyptian one to let 20 trucks a day into Gaza. He also announced that America itself would provide $100m in aid to ease the Palestinians’ plight. The tragedy at the hospital underlined the slow progress of Israel’s effort to encourage Palestinian civilians to move to the southern part of the Gaza Strip to escape the brunt of the looming battle. The IDF says that only 600,000 or so of the 1.1m residents of northern Gaza have heeded its call. By delaying a wide-ranging deal on humanitarian aid or safe zones where civilians can take shelter, the explosion at Ahli Arab will have set back efforts to persuade the holdouts. As it is, more Gazans have already been killed just by Israel’s bombing campaign since October 7th than in any previous conflict involving the territory. Inevitably, a ground assault will lead to far more deaths. Southern Gaza has become extremely overcrowded, with no organised provision of food or shelter for arrivals from the north. Hamas has told Gazans to stay put. What is more, Israeli bombing continues in southern Gaza as well, with reports of refugees from the north being killed in air strikes. A common refrain among Gazans is that nowhere in the territory is safe, and that they might as well stay in the relative comfort of their homes. Another worry for Israel’s generals is the risk of a war on two fronts. Iran, an ally of Hamas, was caught by surprise on October 7th, according to people familiar with the situation. But it has since urged Hizbullah, a big militant group in Lebanon, to enter the fray. Hizbullah has an arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including more accurate ones than Hamas can deploy, which would severely tax Israel’s missile-defence systems. The possibility of war with Hizbullah is looking likelier by the day, say Israeli insiders. Although Hizbullah might prefer not to invite Israeli retaliation against Lebanon, which is gripped by a dire economic slump, it ultimately answers to its Iranian paymasters, not ordinary Lebanese. On October 16th Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, made an ominous warning: “The possibility of pre-emptive action…is expected in the coming hours,” he told Iranian state television. The same day Israel’s government issued an unprecedented order to evacuate 28 Israeli villages within 2km of the border with Lebanon. On October 17th the IDF killed four people attempting to cross a security fence. Some ministers and defence officials have suggested that it may be better for Israel to attack Hizbullah pre-emptively, rather than wait for another surprise attack, this time from the north. Israel’s war cabinet, which includes both Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and various political rivals, including former generals, seems inclined to wait while sending more troops to the border. Israel may also be waiting for more American firepower to arrive in the region. A flotilla led by an aircraft-carrier is already in the eastern Mediterranean. Another is en route. These forces are intended to deter Iran, Hizbullah and other Iran-aligned militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen from entering the war, or attacking American interests in the Gulf. The American ships’ air-defence systems may also be able to provide Israel with additional warning of missile strikes, if not a degree of protection. Another potential disruption to Israel’s preparations for war is the West Bank, the other slice of Palestinian territory, with roughly 2.7m inhabitants. The 40% of it that Israel does not administer directly are in the hands of the PA. But Mr Abbas is weak and unpopular. After the tragedy at the Ahli Arab hospital widespread protests broke out against his government. The IDF’s fear is not so much of a third front, in the form of a popular uprising against Israel, so much as chaos that requires the presence of more Israeli troops. There is also the constant threat of violence between Palestinians and the almost 700,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and the eastern part of Jerusalem. A final reason for Israel to delay its offensive was an effort to free at least some of the Israeli hostages captured on October 7th. The IDF believes that Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups hold 203 of them. Israeli spies have been trying to gather intelligence about where they are being held. Quiet talks to secure the release of hostages had been under way. Qatar, which hosts Hamas’s political leadership and has strong ties to the group, had been acting as a go-between. But those diplomatic efforts appeared to collapse on October 17th after the tragedy at the Ahli Arab hospital. Most Arab states, including those who had previously appeared somewhat sympathetic to Israel, such as the United Arab Emirates, blamed the IDF for the disaster, despite Israel’s detailed disavowal of responsibility. That both makes it much harder for Israel to build diplomatic support for a ground war and gives it less reason to delay, now that Mr Biden has left the region. Israeli commanders, at any rate, are getting itchy feet. The IDF began mustering within hours of the atrocities of October 7th. Its forces have been largely in place for almost a week.“We really should get going this weekend,” says a colonel. “You can maintain this level of readiness for two weeks at the most.” The invasion, when it comes, will be hard-fought and bloody. Israel’s leaders have loudly and repeatedly promised to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities for good and end its 16-year rule. That means a campaign of a different order from previous incursions into Gaza, in 2009 and 2014, which aimed merely to diminish Hamas’s military capacity and were followed by a gradual return to the status quo.  But the Gaza Strip is a difficult place to fight, for several reasons. First, it is full of dense cities, composed of tightly packed apartment blocks. Such places will limit the invaders’ lines of sight and hamper their communications, with the tall buildings impeding radio signals. Civilians could be anywhere, and there will be endless places for Hamas’s fighters to hide. What is more, Hamas has built a 500km network of tunnels under Gaza—a territory only 40km long and 10km wide. The intention was in part to undercut Israel’s technological advantage in seeing and striking from the air. Even the most sophisticated drones cannot provide much information about what is happening underground. Troops entering the tunnels cannot navigate by GPS or communicate by radio. In its invasion of Gaza in 2014 the IDF struggled to deal with such tunnels. It has since invested heavily in subterranean warfare, setting up special units for the task and constructing a simulacrum of Hamas tunnels for training. It has developed various technical means to hunt for them, including some modelled on the underground surveys conducted by the oil industry, as well as methods based on old-fashioned intelligence—looking for spots where militants’ mobile-phone signals suddenly disappear, for instance. Even so, finding and demolishing the tunnel network will be the work of months, if not years, and certainly not a few days. A second concern is the presence of so many Palestinian civilians. American-led assaults on cities during the Iraq war and the Iraqi-led, Western-backed capture of Mosul from Islamic State in 2016-17, were painstakingly planned and conducted with the benefit of copious intelligence. Large numbers of civilians died nonetheless—perhaps as many as 10,000 in the battle for Mosul alone. In theory, international humanitarian law, which governs the conduct of armies once they are waging a war, demands that soldiers distinguish between combatants and military objects on the one hand and civilians and civilian objects on the other. Targeting those on purpose is always illegal. But an attack that kills civilians—even lots of them—can be legal if it is necessary for some military purpose and proportionate “in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”. In other words, Israel can legally justify the deaths of civilians as long as they are killed in the crossfire in operations that did not use disproportionate force. Whatever international law might say, however, as civilian casualties mount, so will pressure on Israel to withdraw and accept a ceasefire. Its previous invasions of Gaza, in 2009 and 2014, were quite brief. In both cases, the IDF remained on the ground for about 18 days. That would not be nearly enough time to achieve Israel’s stated goals this time around. It took Iraqi troops nine months of house-to-house combat to subdue Mosul. That points to perhaps the biggest challenge for Israeli forces in Gaza: not getting bogged down. America’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and Israel’s war in Lebanon in 1982 (the last time all those tanks were deployed) provide cautionary tales. America’s “global war on terror” started triumphantly. Just two months after al-Qaeda’s attacks on America in September 2001, American-led forces were in control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. The Taliban government was gone. Al-Qaeda was hounded. Its leader, Osama bin Laden, was tracked to Pakistan and killed in 2011. But the Taliban fought a growing insurgency. Having lost more than 2,400 military personnel, America left in 2021. The Afghan government collapsed almost immediately and the Taliban returned to power. The war in Iraq was inglorious, too, and far bloodier. Once again, American forces quickly took the capital, Baghdad, in April 2003. President George W. Bush strutted on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft-carrier, under the sign: “Mission Accomplished”. In fact, the country was about to slip into civil war. American forces captured Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s dictator, but soon faced bloody insurgencies by both Sunni and Shia militias. All told, America lost some 4,500 service members, not to mention some 300,000 Iraqis who died, most of them civilians. Israel’s own history offers similar warnings. In 1982, amid a series of attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (plo), the nationalist umbrella group, gunmen shot and wounded Israel’s ambassador in London. The Israeli government took the killing as a casus belli to invade Lebanon and dismantle the plo, even though it was attributed to militants from a rival, the Abu Nidal group. Israeli forces besieged the plo in west Beirut, forcing its leader, Yasser Arafat, and thousands of fighters, to sail into exile. Israel’s Christian ally, Bachir Gemayel, was elected Lebanon’s president. Then it all fell apart. Gemayel was blown up. In sight of Israeli forces, his Phalangist fighters exacted revenge by killing Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps. An Israeli commission of inquiry found Ariel Sharon, Israel’s defence minister, indirectly responsible. Within a year, under pressure from anti-war protests, Menachem Begin, the prime minister, announced his resignation. One effect of the Lebanese imbroglio was that the plo was replaced by Hizbullah, a more formidable, Shia militia, which succeeded in pushing Israel out of Lebanon in 2000. Another impact was on Palestinians within the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Their first intifada, or “shaking off”, a stone-throwing uprising that started in 1987, set the stage for the Oslo accords between Israel and the plo of 1993. Arafat made a triumphant return to Gaza the following year. Hamas emerged as the main force of violent rejectionism and did much to destroy the Oslo accords. It forced Israel out of Gaza in 2005 and won the Palestinian legislative elections in 2006. The following year it pushed out the PA. For Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute, an American think-tank, the lessons are clear. Terrorist and insurgent groups, he argues, resort to spectacular violence to provoke an irrational response. “They know that the harm that they can do to the dominant power is limited,” he says. “They understand that the harm that the dominant power can do to itself is infinitely greater.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/17/putins-plan-to-profit-from-the-israel-hamas-war,"The past 48 hours have seen a burst of diplomacy by Russia regarding the Middle East crisis. On October 16th Vladimir Putin spoke to Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and the leaders of Egypt, Iran, Syria and the Palestinian Authority. Mr Putin expressed his condolences for the murdered Israelis, but failed to denounce Hamas’s attacks. Russia’s autocrat also called for a ceasefire, and blamed the crisis on America. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas The calls confirm two things: Russia’s estrangement from Israel, and that the Kremlin sees the Israel-Hamas war as an opportunity to undermine and distract the West. This effort will be applauded by China: indeed Mr Putin has just arrived in Beijing to attend the Belt and Road summit, hosted by Xi Jinping. Meanwhile Joe Biden will tomorrow fly to Israel to meet Mr Netanyahu, seeking to shape Israel’s military response, get a flow of aid to Gaza and deter Iran and its proxies. The rival jet-setting travel schedules illustrate a world that is divided over Ukraine, the Middle East and more. Mr Netanyahu used to call Vladimir Putin his “dear friend”. He has visited Russia a dozen times in recent years. So he must have been surprised that it took Russia’s president nine days after Hamas’s deadly rampage in southern Israel to pick up the phone. Russia has had scarcely a word of censure for the militants, despite reports that among so many others they killed 16 of its nationals, and that eight more may be missing. Mr Netanyahu had been courting Mr Putin because of Russia’s role in Syria, Israel’s most unstable immediate neighbour. Russia has been propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s murderous dictator, through indiscriminate bombing of various rebel groups. Mr Netanyahu wanted to be sure that Israel would be free to pursue its own interests in Syria, including periodic air strikes, without Russian hindrance. Some argue that Mr Netanyahu, the dominant politician in Israel for the past two decades, also has an affinity for strongmen like Mr Putin. He was hesitant to criticise Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, and muted when he did so. Nor did he supply Ukraine with weapons, despite Ukrainian requests. There is plenty of potential affinity between Russia and Israel: 15% of Israelis speak Russian, owing to their origins in the former Soviet Union. Mr Putin seems to admire Israel as a muscular regional power not afraid to throw its weight around and welcomed Mr Netanyahu’s apparent indifference to Russia’s democratic failings. But for all the shows of warmth, Russian support for Palestinian nationalism has not wavered since the Soviet era, when Russia helped train Palestinian fighters and armed the Arab countries that attacked Israel in 1973. Russia has long been closer to the likes of Syria than it has to Israel. And Mr Putin’s soft spot for Israel has not stopped him cosying up to Iran, the Middle East’s most fervently anti-Israeli regime. There is no suggestion that Russia gave any direct help to Hamas in either the planning or execution of its assault in southern Israel. But Russia has maintained friendly relations with the Iranian-backed organisation since it came to power in Gaza, believing that it might one day come in useful. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warmly welcomed a member of Hamas’s leadership, Khaled Meshaal, to Moscow in 2007. When Israeli forces entered Gaza in 2014 in a seven-week operation, they found themselves on the receiving end of a large number of Russian anti-tank missiles, supplied by Iran. Russia’s ever warmer relationship with Iran has already been creating tensions with Israel and might have caused a falling-out even without the atrocity of October 7th. Last year, as Russia ran low on missiles with which to pulverise Ukraine, it turned to Iran to provide it with hundreds of Shahed self-detonating drones to attack infrastructure and population centres. It is now making a version of its own with assistance from Iran. In return, it is thought that Russia will furnish Iran with attack helicopters and air-defence systems. Those weapons, in turn, would increase Iran’s capabilities should it ever fight a war with Israel. Mr Putin may not want that, but he probably would not mind if Israel’s war against Hamas escalates and widens to other parts of the Arab world. Hamas has already helped take the West’s focus off the war in Ukraine. Joe Biden, America’s president, is trying to secure Congress’s approval for further help for Ukraine by tying it to an emergency aid package for Israel. But even if that succeeds, an expanded conflagration in the Middle East is bound to reduce the flow of munitions to Ukraine, much to Russia’s advantage. By sending two aircraft-carriers to the region, plus its top diplomat, Antony Blinken, America has shown how eager it is to prevent the conflict from broadening. It is hoping to deter Hizbullah, another Iranian proxy, which controls southern Lebanon and has an arsenal of up to 150,000 rockets and missiles pointed at Israel. A wider war would probably bring two benefits to both Russia and Iran. The first would be a spike in oil and gas prices that would help both ailing economies and give Mr Putin extra money to fund his war in Ukraine. The second would be to disrupt America’s plans for the Middle East. Already, Hamas has served Iranian and Russian interests by deferring indefinitely the mooted peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia that America has spent much time and effort attempting to bring about. It is for very much the same reasons that China has also declined to offer Israel comfort by condemning Hamas. China has so far merely expressed concern “over the current escalation of tensions and violence between Palestine and Israel”. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, by juxtaposing the preparations of heavily armed Israeli forces soon to enter Gaza with pictures of American warships apparently steaming towards the conflict zone, Chinese news outlets give the impression that the operation is Washington-led. Like Russia, China will be happy to see America bogged down in the region and its authority challenged. China helped to broker a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia earlier this year partly in the hope of undermining the American-led world order. It may not have had any inkling of Hamas’s plans, but it is unlikely to be regretting the turmoil they have caused.■"
https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/26/the-war-schizophrenia-of-israels-peaceniks,"It became too much when they published David’s name, address, phone number and photograph along with the words: “The next one to get it.” He left his home and borrowed a house from a friend. “I deleted all my social-media accounts,” he told me. “I don’t answer my phone to any number I don’t know.” David is a film-maker living in Tel Aviv, who describes himself as “ultra-progressive, left-wing, anti-Zionist, pro-peace”. His views were minority ones before Hamas’s attack; now they have provoked threats. After his personal information was published on a right-wing Israeli Telegram channel, David was forced into hiding. “If you dare to show solidarity or compassion towards the Palestinian people in Gaza nowadays you are literally risking yourself in Israel. It’s serious shit,” he said. David wanted it made clear that he was appalled by Hamas’s rampage. He volunteers as a driver for Road to Recovery, an organisation that ferries Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank to Israeli hospitals for treatment. More than a dozen volunteers and their family members were killed or kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. “You are talking to a devastated man. I know some of those killed and kidnapped and injured. I have been to funerals and memorial services. I have seen people I know who have lost everything they had. My heart is broken for them.” But, he added, “My heart is broken for the [thousands of] Palestinians in Gaza who have lost their lives and the more than [hundreds of thousands] who have had to leave their homes. For me there is no contradiction.” It’s an irony not lost on peace activists in Israel that those who suffered most from Hamas’s atrocities – the inhabitants of the kibbutzim on the border and the young people dancing at the Nova music festival – tended to be left-wing. Many prominent voices in Israel, including Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who leads a far-right coalition, have called for Hamas to be destroyed. Some have even demanded Gaza be razed. Advocates for human rights and dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians now find themselves challenged by the unfolding events – emotionally, morally, even physically. “It’s very heavy,” Yuval Roth, the founder of Road to Recovery, told me. “It’s very complicated to experience this war from two points of view. It’s like war schizophrenia. You have to work hard all the time to keep your moral compass.” Israel controls the only crossing point from Israel into Gaza and does not usually allow Israeli citizens to visit the territory. Before the war it had restricted the number of permits available for Palestinians in Gaza to enter Israel to around 18,000 workers and a handful of others – mostly medical professionals for attending training or conferences, and cancer patients, often children, for treatment in Israeli hospitals. Personal relations between Israelis and Gazans had become almost impossible. Yet David had managed to strike up a friendship with a Gazan woman named Asmaa, even though they had never met in person. They began chatting on WhatsApp after she responded in English to one of his Facebook posts expressing concern for the inhabitants of Gaza during the last Israeli operation in June 2021. Asmaa’s home was damaged in that bombing campaign. The walls were cracked and rainwater leaked in. David raised some money from his friends and transferred her cash via one of Asmaa’s friends, who worked in construction in Israel. Asmaa sent him photographs of the new plasterwork with gratitude. The pair exchanged holiday greetings at Ramadan and bonded over news of their children, who are of similar ages. David raised more money for a new refrigerator and bought clothes for the kids. Asmaa filmed her children wearing new blue T-shirts, saying “We love you David” as their hands formed heart shapes. Whenever there were rocket attacks on Tel Aviv, Asmaa checked in with David. After the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in May, she sent a video from the funeral of a child who had been killed. David sent her a photograph of himself holding a Palestinian flag at a demonstration. His friend, standing next to him, held a sign that read: “Stop the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.” “This friend of mine lost two family members in the attacks,” David told me, “One killed and one kidnapped.” After Hamas’s attack, Israel began a fierce bombardment of Gaza. David tried to stay in touch with Asmaa. On October 8th, the second day of the war, Asmaa sent him a short video of a school where families had been displaced after the bombing had destroyed their homes. The next day she wrote: “Israel demolished all the mosques and many houses, and hundreds were martyred.” David replied that he was saddened and was praying for her family. (The Israeli government maintains that it attacks only Hamas’s military infrastructure, which is often hidden in buildings used by civilians.) Later that day Asmaa sent him a video of several small suitcases. “We are escaping now,” she said. “Israel is bombing. There is no safety here. Pray for us please.” Asmaa and her family moved to a relative’s house. On October 11th she told David that she was worried her youngest son was not well; she had taken him to a clinic and filmed a video of the boy, crying, with an intravenous drip in his hand. Two days went by without any further news from Asmaa. David knew the power supply and mobile-phone coverage in Gaza were patchy, and he could see that she was offline. He continued to write messages that went unanswered. On October 13th he wrote: “Are you alive, my friend?” After a few hours, Asmaa answered: “We are not OK. There is no water or electricity. The situation is bad. I live in north Gaza and they told us to go to the south but they bombed the roads. Now it is very difficult to move from one area to another.” She had found refuge in a single room with 30 other people and hadn’t changed her clothes for days. On October 15th Asmaa wanted to know if there was any news of a ceasefire. David couldn’t reassure her. She asked him if he could send her some money through PayPal – she needed to buy food, water and nappies. Through a relative of Asmaa’s in Europe, David sent her 1,000 shekels ($250). A day or two later she sent David a video showing what she had bought: cooking oil, rice and flour, bottled water and rolls of toilet paper. She could now, at least, bake flatbreads in a makeshift wood-fired oven. David is not the only Israeli to have suffered a public backlash for expressing sympathy for civilians under bombardment in Gaza. Dror Sadot, who works for B’Tselem, an organisation that has documented human-rights abuses in the West Bank and Gaza since 1989, told me that its social-media accounts had been targeted more than usual by right-wing Israeli groups. “After these terrible crimes Hamas committed, people just want revenge,” said Sadot. Activists worry that the progressive left, already diminished, would shrink even further. Hamas, too, has for a long time tried to sever bonds between Gazans and Israelis. Palestinians who have worked with peace organisations and medical charities have been imprisoned. One Israeli activist I talked to said he had felt “horrible” after an interlocutor in Gaza had been jailed for several months as a result of contact between them a few years ago. “Ever since then we’ve been working under the radar,” he told me. “We are very, very careful about who we’re in touch with.” When I called people in Gaza to talk about their relationships with Israeli humanitarian organisations, they told me they wouldn’t speak on the record. David clings to his belief that his friendship with Asmaa “is evidence of the fact that most people are not so different from each other. We all want to have a safe and steady life for our families. It’s a cliché but it’s also reality.” As we spoke the siren wailed and we took shelter in the safe room of his borrowed house. In Tel Aviv there is usually a 90-second interval between the alarm and the popping thud of the Iron Dome defence system intercepting a Hamas rocket. After a couple of minutes we went outside again and sat on the terrace. I asked David if he could message Asmaa to see if she would be willing to talk to me. For half an hour, WhatsApp showed only one tick indicating the message was undelivered. Then he saw, with relief, the second tick. “She’s alive!” he said. Asmaa said that she did not want to talk to a journalist. “No please, I am afraid.” She sent three emojis of a tearful face. “All the children are crying,” she wrote. “Situation is very difficult here.” ■ Wendell Steavenson has reported on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for 1843 magazine.

https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/03/israels-top-hostage-negotiator-on-dealing-with-hamas,"Twelve years ago David Meidan, an Israeli intelligence officer, found himself standing just metres away from one of Israel’s most-wanted enemies. Across the corridor of the Egyptian intelligence headquarters in Cairo, he had caught a glimpse of Ahmed Jabari, then the military leader of Hamas. Meidan was in Cairo to try to secure the release of Gilad Shalit, a young Israeli corporal captured by Hamas in 2006. Israeli law forbade him from talking directly to Jabari – Egyptian intelligence officers shuttled messages between his room and the adjacent one where the Palestinian delegation were. Meidan remembers thinking Jabari looked tough. Shalit had been imprisoned by Hamas for five years by the time Meidan was given the file in April 2011. Israeli intelligence agents had tried in vain to work out where he was or which unit within Hamas was holding him. An earlier attempt to start negotiations on Shalit’s release through German mediators had sputtered out. When Meidan started his mission he asked Egyptian intelligence which members of Hamas he ought to be talking to. They advised him to focus on Jabari. Hamas’s military leader, Meidan realised, was calling the shots, not the group’s “leaders in suits and ties” residing in “fancy hotels” in Qatar. It was Jabari, Meidan eventually learned, who was Shalit’s jailer. Within six months the young corporal was released, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. When you’re dealing with a shadowy group like Hamas, Meidan explained to me in a bustling café just outside Tel Aviv last Friday, finding the right channel of communication is everything. “You have to find the right mediators. You have to gain their trust.” His phone buzzed constantly as we talked. He left Mossad, Israel’s foreign-intelligence agency, in 2012 and went into the private-security industry. But since the massacres of October 7th, in which Hamas attacked Israel, killed 1,400 people and took at least 240 hostage, he has been volunteering around the clock to help free the captives. American diplomats, who are trying to get back their own citizens, are in frequent contact with him. Old colleagues in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Mossad seek his advice. His main task at the moment, however, is acting as an informal consultant to the families of the hostages. “Whenever a family calls my phone I answer immediately, even if it’s the middle of the night,” he said. Mostly he ignored the buzzing during our four-hour meeting, but on several occasions he glanced at the number and said it was one he had to take, then turned his back to me and spoke quietly. Quiet and unfailingly polite, Meidan is committed to the idea that Israel has a moral duty to get back any citizen who is captured. Before the current crisis he was doing pro bono work on a campaign to free an Ethiopian-Israeli citizen with suspected mental illness who wandered into Gaza in 2014. The hostages seized by Hamas on October 7th must be brought home “at all costs”, Meidan said. “Even if Israel must pay a heavy and painful price of opening its prisons and releasing all the 6,000 Palestinian terrorists.” This uncompromising attitude could make him unpopular with the government of Binyamin Netanyahu. The prime minister did not even meet the families of the hostages until three weeks into the crisis. After public pressure from the families (and prompting from former security officials in private), he has now declared the release of the hostages to be a priority. Though they once worked together reasonably smoothly, Meidan and Netanyahu have bad blood between them. Earlier this year Meidan was rallying protests against the prime minister’s proposals to weaken Israel’s judiciary, which the former Mossad officer saw as a threat to Israeli democracy. He blames Netanyahu for failing to prevent the catastrophe of October 7th; it is only when discussing the prime minister that his usual air of intellectual detachment gives way to something angrier and more emotional. Every week he posts satirical poems about Netanyahu on social media. “Evasive and tricky, he refuses to take responsibility,” reads one. “People are on fire.” Meidan was born In Cairo in 1955. His father ran a textile business which supplied ties to the Egyptian army. Gamal Abdel Nasser had just come to power and was launching fiery diatribes against Israel and the West. Meidan’s parents decided to move to Tel Aviv. “No one asked us to leave but like many Jews we felt that the ground was burning under our feet. The atmosphere was tense and unpleasant.” He studied Arabic in high school, which he later perfected at Tel Aviv University, where he read Arabic and Middle East studies (his Egyptian dialect is so good he has been mistaken for a native speaker). As a young intelligence officer in the 1980s Meidan was posted to Cyprus, where he cultivated sources in Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). In 1985 he helped thwart a PLO attack on a Tel Aviv beach. After successfully running agents across the Middle East for 20 years he was appointed to a senior role in the intelligence agency, working on clandestine initiatives to win the friendship of Arab regimes in the Gulf (such initiatives were often accompanied by the supply of high-tech Israeli spyware). One sunny morning in April 2011 Meidan was attending a graduation ceremony for Mossad’s senior commanders when the organisation’s chief whispered in his ear: “Go immediately to Jerusalem.” Netanyahu wanted him to take over the efforts to free Shalit. The difficulties that Meidan faced negotiating for just one prisoner offer some insight into how hard it will be to free more than 200. First he had to find a channel for meaningful communication with Hamas. The psychological profiles of the organisation’s leaders drawn up by Israeli intelligence were not very helpful. (“No offence, but what I read didn’t help me in my efforts to understand the true nature of who I was dealing with.”) On his first day in the job, an Israeli peace activist called Gershon Baskin asked for a meeting. Baskin said that he had a contact in Hamas who could connect him to the group’s military leadership. Baskin had approached the previous two envoys working on Shalit’s release, but they had rebuffed him – he was seen as a naive daydreamer. Meidan, however, was inclined to be open-minded. “A good intelligence officer needs to know how to observe, to listen, to remember, and not to be dragged into emotional bias,” he explained. Meidan started to exchange messages through Baskin’s contact and it seemed that they were being passed on to Jabari, Hamas’s military commander. At first the messages were just brief texts. Then they developed. Hamas even took to wishing the Israeli “good night” at the end of the day.  As the communication grew more substantive, Meidan gave Baskin access to a fax machine. The Baskin channel helped establish Meidan’s negotiating initiative as a serious one in the eyes of Hamas. “Trust is gained step by step in small, tiny moves,” he said. Soon afterwards, Meidan had the Egyptians set up a meeting with Jabari in Cairo. Jabari was afraid the Israelis would kill him as he drove across the Sinai desert to the Egyptian border, and asked for assurances he would be protected. Initially the atmosphere at the meeting wasn’t promising. Jabari, hardened by 13 years in Israeli jail, was obdurate and uncompromising. “His demands were endless.” The Egyptians sought to soften him with small luxuries. They even took him to the cinema for the first time. Meidan meanwhile worked to establish himself as someone who could be relied on to “stick to the understandings and agreements reached”. Over the course of several mediation sessions, the negotiations inched forward from the principles of a deal to the names of which prisoners would be released. This, Meidan recalled, was the toughest part of the process. Several of the men on Hamas’s list had been involved in killing Israelis. Meidan at least had the advantage of knowing in advance what Jabari was going to ask for because Israel was eavesdropping on Hamas’s communications. ‘We always knew what his next move would be,” he said. Netanyahu was under a lot of pressure domestically at this point. Unprecedented protests about the rising cost of living in Israel had broken out that summer. In the end Meidan was authorised to offer over 1,000 prisoners for Shalit, including some controversial ones (Yahya Sinwar, now the head of Hamas in Gaza, was on the list). In October 2011 Meidan flew in a private jet to Cairo to sign the deal. Even then it nearly fell apart at the last minute. Jabari signed the document first, which was in Arabic. Meidan says that when he read through it before adding his own signature he noticed that some lines that had been agreed on were missing. He refused to sign and accused Hamas of cheating. The Egyptian intelligence officers went to talk to Jabari. After  two nerve-racking hours the Hamas team agreed to reinstate the lines, and the agreement was signed. “Of course, we experienced moments of anger and frustration, but we never threatened,” said Meidan. “I don’t believe in threats.” A week later Jabari and the Egyptian intelligence officers escorted Shalit to the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Meidan and his team were waiting for him in an old Israeli military car. One of the Egyptian officials laughed and suggested Shalit and Meidan might be more comfortable driving to the Israeli border in his Mercedes, which they ended up doing. From the border Shalit and Meidan were flown in an Israeli military helicopter to an air-force base. When the helicopter door opened Meidan was astonished to see Netanyahu waiting for the fragile young soldier, together with a hastily assembled press corps. It had been too good a photo opportunity for the prime minister to pass up. In October 2012 Meidan was asked to talk about his experiences as a hostage negotiator to students at Tel Aviv University, his alma mater. He told them, among other things, that Netanyahu’s domestic political troubles had played a role in leading him to accept Hamas’s extraordinarily high demands. Somehow, the master spy failed to consider the possibility that someone might be recording the session. It leaked to the press and Netanyahu was furious. Meidan had been tipped to be the next leader of Mossad, but Netanyahu would have to approve his nomination. Knowing he now had no chance of progressing further he resigned. His intelligence career was over. A year after Shalit’s release Israel assassinated Ahmed Jabari in a missile strike as he drove through Gaza city. “It was wrong,” Meidan told me. The effort to free the October 7th hostages is spread across different organisations. One is the IDF, which is gathering intelligence, planning rescue operations and, selectively, sharing information with the hostages’ relatives. The families have formed a committee so they can work together to get publicity and press the government. The majority of them want attacks on Gaza to stop until their relatives are home, although a minority support the bombardment. Netanyahu has also appointed an envoy for the hostages. Both Qatar and Egypt are reported to be involved in attempts to mediate their release. When the hostages’ relatives call him, Meidan gives them the same piece of advice: “separate noises from sounds”. Many people are offering to help get the hostages out of Gaza. Some are well-intentioned; some, as Meidan puts it, are “charlatans”. He believes time is critical if a number of the hostages are to survive and investing too much time and energy in the wrong channels could be costly. The families need to “concentrate and find the right mediators, whether it’s Qatar, Egypt or Turkey”, said Meidan. “Don’t look for too many avenues. ”When he was negotiating the Shalit exchange, he always opposed the idea of dividing the deal into different phases. Now, because of the sheer scale of the hostage-taking, he thinks differently. “If we cannot have an entire deal let’s do it gradually, women and children first, in order to establish trust.” Even after all the blood that has been shed in the past three weeks, Meidan believes trust can and must be established between Israel and Hamas’s hostage negotiators. Yuval Diskin, a former head of the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security service, who has worked with Meidan on the ongoing attempt to release the Ethiopian-Israeli, says it is this capacity for “creative thinking” that makes Meidan such an effective negotiator. “He understands the full range of Arab culture, and above all is a mensch.” Meidan has suspended public campaigning against Netanyahu, but plans to resume it once the war ends. We said goodbye amid the hiss of coffee machines, the distant explosion of Iron Dome defences intercepting rockets from Gaza and the endless vibrating of his mobile phone. I asked him what he’d learned from the Shalit negotiations. “Clinch a deal as fast as you can,” he said. “Because it might be too late.” ■ Yossi Melman is a defence and security analyst for Haaretz ILLUSTRATIONS:  MICHELLE THOMPSON SOURCE IMAGES: HADAS PARUSH/ HAARETZ, getty, ilya mElinkov/ynet, gpo"
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-atrocities-and-israels-retaliation-will-change-both-sides-for-ever,"THE FIRST hours were chaos. Residents of southern Israel, near the border with Gaza, woke to the sound of incoming rockets and mortars. They rushed to shelters—a grim routine in this part of the country, but a routine nonetheless. Then, a few minutes later, they heard gunfire drawing steadily closer and shouting in Arabic. That was not routine at all. Nor were the unimaginable scenes outside their homes, snippets of which began to trickle out on social media: Palestinian militants on the bed of a pickup truck, driving through an Israeli town firing at passers-by; a pile of bodies at a bus stop, another at an army post. The morning dragged on, and no help arrived. Frantic Israelis called television-news shows from their safe rooms and asked, in hushed tones, where their army was. Then, no less shocking, came the reports of abductions. A mother said her two sons, one of them just 12 years old, had been kidnapped and dragged across the border. A video showed an elderly woman, her stiff smile belying her shock, paraded through the streets of Gaza on a golf cart, an armed man seated behind her. The death toll went up and up and up. Almost a week later, authorities were still counting bodies. In Be’eri, a small kibbutz of around 1,000 people, militants went door-to-door and slaughtered some 10% of the population. An even greater number may have been killed in Kfar Azza, eight kilometres to the north. For Israelis October 7th was a day without precedent. More than 1,300 people were killed, in a country of just 10m. The death toll exceeds the number of Israelis killed in all violence between Israelis and Palestinians over the prior 20 years. Another 3,300 people were wounded. Israelis had thought Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group that controls Gaza, was a manageable threat. Now it has carried out the deadliest terror attack in their country’s history. The mightiest army in the Middle East lost control of its own towns, and needed days to regain it. Authorities have recovered the bodies of at least 1,500 Palestinian militants—more than a battalion’s worth of gunmen who managed to flood across the supposedly well-defended boundary. As shock gives way to anger, the immediate question is how Israel will respond. It has already begun a campaign of retaliatory air strikes, which has killed more than 1,200 Palestinians, many of them civilians, and displaced more than 300,000. Israel will not stop there, although its military options are unappealing. There is bound to be more suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians in the weeks ahead. But the consequences of October 7th will be much more sweeping. The massacre could reshape not only Israel’s approach to the Palestinians but also its own domestic politics. It threatens Hamas’s grip on power in Gaza; it also risks a regional war. The assault began with a barrage of rockets: 2,200 of them in a matter of hours. That would have been shocking enough: it took Hamas almost a month to fire that many during its war against Israel in 2014. But Israelis soon discovered that the launches were cover for a bigger operation. Bulldozers breached the border fence and hundreds of militants streamed across. Others flew over it in paragliders or sailed round it in dinghies. They fanned out to Israeli cities and towns and started killing. It took Israel hours to organise a defence. Some units had to be rushed south from the northern border. Once they arrived, they languished in staging areas while commanders tried to work out a battle plan. Several retired generals took matters into their own hands, donning their old uniforms and driving to besieged villages to lead impromptu counter-attacks. Even before it reclaimed its own territory, Israel started air strikes on Gaza. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, announced that Israel was at war, and his government began to prepare for a possible ground offensive. The army has mobilised 360,000 reservists and has spent days shifting tanks and other kit to the Gaza border. Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, promised a total siege of Gaza. “No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel, everything is closed.” On October 11th its sole power plant ran out of fuel and shut down.  Erez, the sole border crossing between Israel and Gaza, is closed indefinitely. Israel told civilians in Gaza to flee via the Rafah crossing with Egypt, but has repeatedly bombed it. Egypt anyway severely restricts the numbers permitted to cross. It is hard for Palestinians to leave Gaza even in peacetime. Now it is impossible. As it prepares to fight in Gaza, the Israeli army must keep an eye on its northern border. On October 8th Hizbullah, a Shia militant group and political party in Lebanon, shelled the Shebaa Farms, a disputed sliver of territory. By unspoken rules of engagement, what happens in Shebaa stays in Shebaa: Hizbullah could show support for the Palestinians but also show Israel it did not want a broader conflict. A day later, though, the Israeli army killed a group of gunmen who crossed the border from Lebanon. Three Hizbullah militants were then killed in Israel’s retaliatory bombardment, which led the group to fire rockets at an Israeli army post. Neither side may want a war, but escalation is not always guided by logic. Lebanese citizens have rushed to stockpile food and fuel. Israel has evacuated towns near the northern border. Hamas has called loudly for others to join its attack on Israel. Israeli forces may take time to prepare, but a ground offensive against the Gaza Strip seems all but certain. Israeli troops occupied Gaza from 1967 to 2005, when they withdrew, forcing about 8,000 Jewish settlers to retreat with them. Since then, Israel has largely blockaded the territory by air, land and sea, while allowing some Palestinians to work in Israel and goods of a non-threatening nature to enter. (Egypt is almost as restrictive.) Israel’s most recent incursion into Gaza, in 2014, was to destroy tunnels Hamas had dug under the border fence to infiltrate Israel. Israeli forces did not penetrate very far into the territory, which is only about 10km wide and 40km long, but home to 2m people. Even so, the operation showed how ground assaults can go wrong. A Hamas unit attacked an Israeli patrol near Rafah and captured an officer, Hadar Goldin. Israel subsequently shelled Rafah for days, killing dozens of Palestinians. Goldin was later declared dead. Israelis dubbed the incident “Black Friday”. The impending attack will be much bigger. Israel is likely to deploy two armoured divisions and one lighter airborne division, each of which has five brigades. Some of these units are waiting for their tanks and other equipment to reach staging areas around Gaza. Others took losses over the past several days of combat. Assuming Israel’s leaders do order a large-scale invasion, one or two armoured brigades with tanks would probably try to cut the strip in two by pushing west at its narrowest point—6km—near Deir al-Balah. Two or three other brigade-sized units—a few thousand men each—would probably focus on the north, including around Gaza City, and one or two others on Khan Yunis or Rafah in the south. Their aim would probably be to target both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a separate militant group, focusing on leaders and infrastructure beyond the reach of air strikes. Hamas has claimed that it has several hundred kilometres of tunnels in Gaza. Locating their entrances and dropping in explosives will be a priority. The biggest challenge will be urban warfare, a notoriously difficult task. Gaza is more densely populated than London or Tokyo, giving militants lots of places to hide and civilians few places to take refuge. Hamas may be counting on a relatively cautious assault. The group assumes that Israel will not have the stomach for the high casualties a ground invasion would entail. “We know that they are cowards,” says Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official based in Qatar. “We know that they can’t fight on the ground.” It also expects the presence of more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages in Gaza will restrain the Israeli forces. Hamas hopes to exchange these prisoners for many, if not all, of the 5,200 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. It has also threatened to kill one each time Israel bombs civilian homes in Gaza “without advance warning”. The catastrophic death toll of recent days may change the Israeli calculus, however. “The Israeli willingness to bear—and exact—costs is much higher than in the past,” says Natan Sachs of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington. As for the hostages, many Israelis still burying loved ones say they are in no mood to haggle with the group that killed them. Indeed, Israel is having to re-examine many long-held assumptions, most notably the belief that Gaza could safely be left to fester. After Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from the Palestinian Authority (pa), the Palestinian government-in-waiting, Israel and Egypt drastically tightened border restrictions, asphyxiating Gaza’s economy. Despite the repeated bouts of violence since then, Israeli officials had come to think that Hamas had become more pragmatic. “Above all, they want to keep control of Gaza,” an army officer said last year. “To do that they need to improve the economy.” If Israel allowed Arab governments to bankroll basic social services in Gaza, the thinking ran, and issued more permits for Gazans to work in Israel, the territory would remain quiescent. Not only was that view completely wrong, but Israel’s vaunted security services also failed to spot that an elaborate attack was in the works. Every phone call in Gaza is routed through Israeli networks, which simplifies eavesdropping. Drones frequently fly over the strip. Israel also has a vast network of informants in the territory—all to no avail. Part of the problem, no doubt, was a conceptual failure: the belief that Hamas had lost interest in large-scale conflict. In fact, even some Hamas leaders seem surprised. Mr Abu Marzouk says he and other senior leaders in Qatar were not told about the attack in advance. Since 2017, when Yahya Sinwar became the leader of Hamas in Gaza, a small number of hardliners, mostly based in Gaza, have consolidated power. A second error was the divide-and-rule policy towards the Palestinians of Binyamin Netanyahu, who has been Israel’s prime minister for 12 of the past 14 years. He has long sought to undermine the PA, which still runs parts of the West Bank. He has refused to resume peace negotiations since half-hearted talks broke down in 2014. He has frozen transfers of the tax revenues Israel collects on the pa’s behalf. At the same time, he has treated Hamas like a legitimate power in Gaza. In 2011, for instance, he approved a deal to swap 1,027 Palestinian prisoners for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier the militants had captured in 2006. The exchange, naturally, raised Hamas’s standing among Palestinians. For Mr Netanyahu, the logic was clear. The PA is committed to negotiating a two-state solution with Israel, which is anathema to the prime minister’s right-wing supporters. Undermining the PA and boosting its militant rival would help him to claim that Israel has no “partner for peace”. But Palestinians drew a different, if predictable lesson: that the only way to extract concessions from Israel is through force. Hamas may now have overreached, however. Some observers believe it did not expect its assault to be so successful and is not sure how to proceed. It may have hoped to frighten Israel into concessions, but has instead steeled it for war. The Israeli army told foreign defence attachés on October 10th that its aim was to “eliminate” the leadership of Hamas. “The military end-goal is to destroy Hamas’s capability, no matter how long it takes,” the army said, according to someone who attended. That is easier said than done, though, as America learned during its long war in Afghanistan, or Israel during its 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon. Even if Israel could uproot Hamas, no one is sure what would replace it. The PA is too weak to assert authority in Gaza; it is not even strong enough to control the West Bank, parts of which have fallen into anarchy. A plurality of Palestinians, and a majority of Gazans, want to dissolve it. Mahmoud Abbas, the 87-year-old president, has not set foot in Gaza in almost 20 years. There has been some idle talk of sending Arab peacekeepers to secure Gaza, but few Arab regimes would want to do so. Egypt occupied Gaza from 1949 to 1967; both sides have bitter memories of that time. Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have no desire to rule over 2m Palestinians. Nor do most Israelis wish to reoccupy the territory. To invade and then leave, however, would not change the status quo. Hamas’s leaders and a large proportion of its fighters are likely to emerge from their bunkers and restore control over the strip the minute the Israelis depart. That is an unpalatable outcome, but it is the most likely one. Charting a clear path forward would be difficult for any Israeli government, but especially for the current one. This has been a year of deep political turmoil. Mr Netanyahu won a plurality of seats in a snap election in November, after more than a year in opposition. He presides over a government comprised entirely of right-wing and religious parties. His minister for national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was banned from serving in the Israeli army because of his extreme nationalist views. Mr Netanyahu has since pursued a divisive agenda, which includes curtailing the Supreme Court’s authority to overturn government policies and giving politicians more say in the appointment of judges. Critics dubbed this a judicial “coup” and have staged mass protests every Saturday this year—until October 7th, when they were suspended. Army reservists threatened to boycott their mandatory service (that tactic, too, has been shelved). Optimists hope this month’s carnage will help shift Israeli politics back to the centre. “If there can be one conciliation after this darkest of days, it will be Israel returning to its senses, ending the political crisis and forming a unity government,” wrote Shimrit Meir, an adviser to Naftali Bennett, who replaced Mr Netanyahu in 2021 for a brief stint as prime minister. In a prime-time address on October 9th Mr Netanyahu urged centrist parties to join his government “without preconditions”. On October 11th, after a couple of days of negotiation, Benny Gantz, a former army chief who leads the second-biggest centrist party, National Unity, agreed to join an “emergency government”. But Yair Lapid, leader of the biggest opposition party, Yesh Atid, has so far declined to participate. The dilemma, for both parties, lies in joining a government that their supporters have spent the past year protesting against. Mr Netanyahu has promised not to pursue any legislation unrelated to the war, but has refused to jettison his most extreme coalition partners. That makes sense for a prime minister concerned, as ever, with his political survival. The unity government will only last as long as the fighting does. Mr Netanyahu does not want to alienate the parties he will then need to form another right-wing coalition. Mr Gantz has held his nose and joined anyway, lending military expertise to a government that lacks it. Although that will steady the government for the time being, the events of recent days may yet put an end to Mr Netanyahu’s long and comeback-filled career. He has spent a year fighting a needless political battle instead of focusing on real threats—and many years before that labouring to make Palestine a problem with no solution. Security is his watchword and he has overseen the Israeli armed forces and intelligence services for more than a decade, with only a brief interruption. Hamas, for its part, has opted for murderous nihilism. To talk to its leaders is to slip into a fantasy world where Gaza is “liberated”, even though its inhabitants are trapped in penury in a 365 square-kilometre cell. Victory over Israel is imminent and until then Gazans will gladly endure their lot. Since the massacre the group has made clear that, apart from the hope of sparking a broader attack on Israel, it has no plan beyond continued violence. The unfolding cataclysm, in short, seems likely to lay bare the poverty of thinking on both sides. Alas, the appalling bloodshed of recent days, and the likelihood of further horrors to come, will also make adopting a more constructive approach to the conflict that much harder. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/17/israels-constitutional-chaos-is-far-from-over,"By 1989 the city of Jerusalem had been trying for nearly two decades to build a new football stadium. Powerful religious groups who saw matches on the Sabbath as a desecration of Jerusalem’s sanctity had blocked the project, but at last ground could be broken. One obstacle remained. The acting interior minister, Arye Deri, an up-and-coming ultra-Orthodox politician, blocked the land-use change. Teddy Kollek, the city’s mayor, took him to court. In January 1989 the Supreme Court ruled that Mr Deri had acted “in an unreasonable way”. Two and a half years later the first match was played at Teddy Stadium. Legal experts cite the case as one of the earliest examples of the court’s nullifying a government decision on the grounds of “reasonableness”. That principle was introduced in a ruling in 1980 by Aharon Barak, then a new judge on the Supreme Court. It revolutionised Israeli jurisprudence and is a principal source of the constitutional chaos engulfing Israel today. On July 23rd Binyamin Netanyahu’s government is set to pass an amendment to one of Israel’s quasi-constitutional “basic laws”. It would give the government immunity from the reasonableness standard. Israelis have been taking to the streets since the start of this year in protest. Even Israel’s closest ally is concerned. On July 17th, after meeting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, President Joe Biden applauded the vibrancy of Israel’s democracy but urged Mr Netanyahu not to rush his reforms and to seek a consensus for them. The reasonableness standard has affected decisions in almost every area of Israeli politics. It was used by the Supreme Court in 1989 to force the army to put on trial a colonel who ordered his soldiers to beat up Palestinian detainees. The following year the court invoked it to direct the attorney-general to charge bankers with share manipulation. In 1993 the court again took on Mr Deri, ruling that he could not remain interior minister after being indicted for corruption. He was forced to resign, convicted and sent to prison. He then returned to politics. In January 2023 the Supreme Court ruled once again he must resign from cabinet because of a conviction for tax fraud. Seven of the justices cited the reasonableness standard. Mr Deri is no longer in the cabinet, but he still leads the second-largest party in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition and is one of his closest allies. “They are trying to immunise the government and all the ministers from judicial review,” says Menachem Mazuz, a former Supreme Court justice and attorney-general.  Mr Barak was not the first to invoke the reasonableness standard but he greatly extended its scope. He was admired by many who, like him, believed that in the absence of a written constitution and bill of rights, it was up to the Supreme Court to protect individual rights and the public interest. Others criticised him for extending the court’s powers without authority. Reasonableness, argues Yoav Dotan, a law professor at the Hebrew University and a critic of the principle, is not a legal standard: it is “a linguistic construct invented by the court.” On March 27th Mr Netanyahu announced the suspension of his proposed legal reforms in favour of pursuing a broader consensus on constitutional change. But when talks with the opposition broke down in June, the government changed tack, focusing on limiting the reasonableness standard as a first step.  Many legal critics of the standard oppose this amendment. Mr Dotan has joined street protests against it. “I don’t want to be anyone’s useful idiot,” he says. Like many, he fears that the government’s reforms, even those he agrees with in principle, are a prelude to an erosion of democracy.  Mr Dotan and other legal experts have advocated a less sweeping amendment that would exclude only decisions made by the entire cabinet (as opposed to individual ministers) from the reasonableness standard. The opposition parties have agreed to this in principle in exchange for the suspension of the rest of the constitutional changes for the duration of this Knesset term. But the coalition is in no mood for compromises. As huge protests return and thousands of military reservists refuse to “serve a dictatorship”, Israel is once again on the brink of civil unrest. ■"
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-has-claimed-14000-lives-since-1987,"EIGHT DAYS have passed since the simmering conflict between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over once more. According to data from OCHA, a UN organisation, by May 17th it had claimed the lives of 230 people—mostly Palestinians but also nine Israelis and one Indian. The deaths of two Thai factory workers in Israel was announced on May 18th. The spark for the latest fighting came in Jerusalem, after Palestinians in the city objected to the erection of metal barriers near the Damascus gate of the old walled city—the main thoroughfare to the al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest place in Islam—during the month of Ramadan. As unrest escalated in Jerusalem, Hamas—a militant Islamist organisation that runs the impoverished enclave of Gaza—began to fire rockets into Israeli territory. Israel’s armed forces responded by bombarding Gaza. The fighting is reminiscent of three previous rounds of war. One difference this time is that violence has spread to Arabs and Jews in Israel’s mixed cities. America has repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council statements on the fighting, but on May 17th, in a call with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, President Joe Biden expressed support for a ceasefire. America is working with Egypt and other regional partners to secure one. It cannot come soon enough. The Palestinian dead include 96 women and children. With the exception of one soldier, all of the Israeli dead are civilians, too. The victims in this latest bout join a tragic toll from the decades-old conflict. According to data gathered by B’Tselem, an Israeli human-rights organisation, between December 9th 1987 and April 30th 2021, the conflict claimed 13,969 lives. Fully 87% of the dead were Palestinian. The recent violence brings the total to over 14,000. The bloodshed has come in different phases. The first Palestinian intifada, or “shaking off” of 1987 was a shock to Israel at the time and was the backdrop for the Oslo peace accords of 1994. They pointed the way to a two-state solution: the creation of a Palestinian state in territories occupied by Israel in 1967. But instead of peace came more violence. Extremists on both sides sought to destroy the compromise; Hamas and another radical faction, Islamic Jihad, in particular, embarked on a campaign of suicide-bombings; Israel responded with harsher security measures, including ever greater restrictions on the Gaza Strip. The failure of the Camp David talks in 2000 sparked the second, and far more violent intifada, which shifted from stone-throwing to the use of weapons, not least by the Palestinian Authority established under the Oslo accords, and more suicide-bombings. It prompted Israel to build a security barrier in the West Bank and to withdraw from Gaza in 2005. And since Hamas seized power in the enclave, there have been repeated rounds of fighting—the deadliest of which erupted in 2014. Settlement-building on occupied land has continued relentlessly. Latterly, though, the intensity of the conflict has diminished. The data from B’Tselem show that in the 15 years between the second intifada, which began in September 2000, and the end of the second Gaza war in August 2014, 800 people died each year, on average. Since then, victims have numbered 175 a year. In the same period, Israeli deaths fell from 85 a year to 14. Israel’s military might, its erection of security barriers and its deployment of anti-missile defences mean that, for most Israelis, most of the time, the conflict is out of sight and out of mind. Relations with Palestinians barely featured as an issue in the four elections Israel has held in the past two years. The international outcry over the plight of Palestinians is unlikely to change this mindset. The latest fighting may show how the unjust treatment of the Palestinians stores up trouble. But even now, the endless occupation seems tolerable to many Israelis who have lost faith in peace."
https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/20/biden-pleads-the-case-for-israel-ukraine-and-american-leadership,"WITH WAR raging in Israel as well as Ukraine, President Joe Biden made an impassioned plea for America to act again as “the arsenal of democracy” by providing tens of billions of dollars of military aid to both allies. He adapted the idea of America as the “indispensable nation”—a concept coined by the late secretary of state, Madeleine Albright—to cast the country as the “essential nation”, vital to holding back the forces of aggression, be they terrorists or bully states. Mr Biden drew a direct connection between Hamas’s slaughter of Israeli communities on October 7th and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year. “Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” Mr Biden said in a televised address to Americans on October 19th. Another common thread, he noted, is that both foes are supported by Iran. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas Mr Biden was seeking to harness bipartisan sympathy for the Jewish state to reaffirm the United States’ global role. “American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe,” he declared. He is also hoping the explosive crisis in the Middle East will bring a divided and paralysed Congress to its senses. It has been unable to pass bills because infighting among Republicans in the House of Representatives is preventing the election of a speaker. Mr Biden is reported to be preparing a request for roughly $100bn in supplemental funding for national-security priorities. If so, his calculation is that at least some sceptical Republicans will swallow the large pill of perhaps $60bn in additional aid for Ukraine by wrapping it in other causes they support more wholeheartedly—not least $10bn-14bn in aid to Israel, as well as help for Taiwan and funding to strengthen America’s southern border. Mr Biden was speaking a day after visiting Israel, where he sought to prevent the crisis from spiralling out of control. Hamas’s onslaught killed about 1,400 Israelis, and led to the capture of over 200 hostages. More than 3,700 Palestinians have died in Israel’s retribution against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel has cut off supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity to Palestinians there. Both sides traded blame for an explosion at a hospital on October 17th that killed scores if not hundreds of people: Palestinians say it was caused by an Israeli strike; Israel contends it was the result of an errant Palestinian rocket. Mr Biden, for his part, was adamant that it “was not done by the Israelis”. Amid anti-Israeli protests across the Arab world and beyond, “all the indications are that the worst is coming,” said Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, at a press conference on October 19th. Despite Mr Biden’s efforts, a promised humanitarian corridor between Egypt and the Gaza Strip has yet to open. America vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a “humanitarian pause” in the fighting because it did not recognise Israel’s right to defend itself. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, signalled that ground operations in Gaza, which may prove to be an even bloodier phase, would begin “soon”. Signs are growing that Iran is pushing its proxies to expand the conflict. On Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, Israeli forces and Hizbullah, a powerful Shia militia created by Iran, have been exchanging artillery and missile fire for days. Meanwhile south of Israel, in the Red Sea, an American guided-missile destroyer, the USS Carney, intercepted three cruise missiles and several drones launched by the Houthi militia in Yemen, another Iranian ally, towards targets assumed to be in Israel. The action on October 19th raises the prospect that the expanding fleet of American warships in the eastern Mediterranean—one American aircraft-carrier strike group has been deployed there and a second is on its way— may yet intervene if Israel and Hizbullah go to war. Separately, American bases in Iraq and Syria have been repeatedly attacked with drones and rockets in recent days, according to the Pentagon. It did not identify the attackers, but they are likely to be pro-Iranian militias. “Any response, should one occur, will come at a time [and] in a manner of our choosing,” a spokesman said. Despite growing left-wing protests, and the resignation of a State Department official, Mr Biden did not waver from his embrace of Israel. “We’re going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever—and prevent this conflict from spreading.” At the same time, though, he said Israel had to operate “by the laws of war” and protect civilians. He repeated the call he made in Israel, drawing from America’s encounter with al-Qaeda’s terrorism in 2001. “When America experienced the hell of 9/11 we felt enraged as well. While we sought and got justice, we made mistakes. So I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage.” He also urged Israel not to “give up on peace” based on a two-state solution: that is, the creation of a Palestinian state. Mr Biden’s speech pinballed between Israel and Ukraine. Republicans, in particular, have grown increasingly sceptical of the cost of supporting Ukraine’s war against Russia, now nearly 20 months old and close to stalemate. “If we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine’s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same,” Mr Biden said, arguing that conflict and chaos could spread around the world. Giving support to American allies and partners, he said, was “a smart investment that’s going to pay dividends for American security for generations,” Mr Biden insisted. It would help keep American troops out of harm’s way. He also argued that the money for Ukraine was being spent on American-made weapons, and served to replenish America’s own arsenal with more modern weapons. Patriot air-defence missiles were made in Arizona, he noted; 12 states were involved in the manufacture of artillery shells. With an eye on the 2024 elections and questions about whether, at the age of 80, he is able to campaign for and serve a second term, Mr Biden highlighted his wartime visit to Kyiv in February and his recent trip to Israel, boasting that he was “the first American [president] to enter a war-zone not controlled by the United States military since President Lincoln”. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/06/israel-launched-its-biggest-raid-on-the-west-bank-in-over-20-years,"The israeli operation in Jenin was in its final hours on the afternoon of July 4th as a small armoured convoy traversed the wreckage in the town’s main square, avoiding Palestinian ambulances hurrying back and forth. Nearly 1,000 Israeli special forces had entered the previous morning, covered by drone strikes, in pursuit of some 300 militants of Kata’ib Jenin (the Jenin Brigades) who for nearly two years have controlled Jenin’s refugee camp. Twelve Palestinians (Israel says they were militants) and an Israeli soldier were killed. Dozens of Palestinians were wounded and captured. The Israelis say 30 workshops and weapons caches have been destroyed. But the Palestinians’ resistance did not disappear. As your correspondent drove into Jenin with an Israeli unit, an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated beneath the lead vehicle, which just made it to makeshift headquarters on the edge of the camp. In the streets youngsters pelted the convoy with rocks and paint-bombs, while shots were sporadically fired at it from afar. By the morning of July 5th the Israelis had left, ending a 48-hour operation, the biggest raid on a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank since 2002. But Brigadier General Avi Bluth, head of Israel’s forces there, has little doubt that the militants will soon be back. Jenin camp is one of the Palestinians’ oldest. Around 18,000 people are crammed into less than half a square kilometre. The town has one of the highest unemployment rates in the West Bank; much of its residents’ income is from day-labourers working in Israel. For two years it has posed a severe headache to Israeli security forces and to those of the toothless Palestinian Authority based in Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem. The Palestinian security forces are unlikely to re-establish their writ in Jenin for the foreseeable future. Jenin has long been a symbol of deadly terror for Israelis and diehard resistance for Palestinians, who abhor Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank and generally despise the corrupt and sclerotic rule of Mahmoud Abbas, the 87-year-old Palestinian president who is regarded by them as a proxy for Israel. Hamas, an Islamist group that runs Gaza, said a car-ramming and stabbing attack on July 4th in Tel Aviv was in revenge for the raid on Jenin. Since spring last year, militants based in Jenin have carried out a string of attacks, including one in Tel Aviv last April in which three Israelis were shot dead in the main nightlife district. In response Israeli security forces have made regular raids on Jenin to kill or capture important figures in the brigades. But, as a senior Israeli officer recently admitted: “The fact they are not part of any established network or organisation has made it very difficult to root them out.” The brigades are made up of young men, some affiliated to various Palestinian factions and others to none of them. They have made IEDs that can disable Israeli armoured vehicles. They have also tried to build rockets to hit villages in Israel proper. Their growing firepower was one reason for the latest incursion. Israel’s generals reckon the latest operation may suffice for the time being. But the Israeli far right are demanding more and wider operations, including against the restive West Bank city of Nablus. Jewish settlers in the West Bank and their influential backers in the cabinet of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, played a part in encouraging the latest attack on Jenin.  Israel has been here before. In April 2002, after a series of suicide-bombings in Israel during the second intifada, an uprising that lasted from 2000 to 2005, the Israeli army battled for 11 days to control the Jenin refugee camp, where many of those bombings had originated. More than 50 Palestinians and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed. Armoured bulldozers razed much of the camp. This time, largely due to better intelligence and aerial surveillance, the incursion was shorter and less destructive. But future battles for Jenin surely await. The violence has not yet spread to other parts of the West Bank. But even if the incursion does not cause it to escalate, the anger of young Palestinians will only grow in the absence of a serious process towards statehood or equality. As sophisticated and powerful as Israel’s army is, it can only buy temporary respite. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/30/why-libyas-cackhanded-israel-diplomacy-is-bad-for-america-too,"IT WAS a lesson in how not to conduct diplomacy. On August 27th Eli Cohen, the Israeli foreign minister, announced that days earlier in Rome he had met his Libyan counterpart, Najla al-Mangoush. The meeting was meant to be secret. His disclosure sparked protests across Libya, which has no overt ties with Israel. The Libyan foreign ministry downplayed it as a chance encounter. Israeli officials countered that it was a well-planned meeting which lasted two hours. Ms Mangoush was sacked and then fled the country. Opposition MPs in Israel castigated Mr Cohen for his “amateurish” decision to reveal the meeting. American officials are furious too, saying his disclosure damaged their efforts to prod Arab states to recognise Israel. Since 2020, when four Arab states signed the Abraham accords, America has made clear that Arab-Israeli normalisation is the main focus of its Middle East policy. The tête-à-tête between the foreign ministers in Rome followed a January meeting between Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, Libya’s prime minister, and William Burns, America’s CIA director, where they discussed the topic. Mr Dbeibeh has tried to distance himself from the Rome meeting, but it is hard to imagine Ms Mangoush met Mr Cohen without her boss’s approval. If you are an unelected Arab leader hungry for American support, the quickest way to win it is to talk about relations with Israel. Mr Dbeibeh’s government was not alone in doing so. Saddam Haftar, a son of Khalifa Haftar, a powerful warlord in eastern Libya, held secret meetings with Israeli officials in 2021. He proposed normalising ties in exchange for weapons and diplomatic support. Israel has also had contacts in the past with Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, a son of the dictator deposed in 2011, who is eyeing a run for president in Libya’s long-delayed elections. The controversial decisions by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to sign the Abraham accords unlocked billions of dollars in bilateral investment, brought a flood of Israeli tourists to the Gulf, and boosted security ties with the Middle East’s strongest power. With Libya the benefits would be far less solid. It is unlikely that Israeli firms would invest in a chronically unstable state—let alone that Israeli tourists would visit it. Selling arms to Libya would be tricky: the country is under a UN arms embargo. Talks with Israel are less about the national interest than about the narrow interests of power-hungry politicians. There is an obvious corollary in Sudan, which has struggled through a fraught transition since the coup in 2019 against Omar al-Bashir, its dictator. The army leadership has moved ahead with recognition of Israel, which Sudan agreed to after America promised to remove it from a list of states that sponsor terrorism, even as it has torn up a plan for moving Sudan to civilian rule and shot hundreds of protesters. In April the Rapid Support Forces, a vicious paramilitary group, attacked the army in their own bid for power. So Israel’s newest relationship in the Arab world is with a state mired in civil war, where an estimated 4m people have fled armed gangs that loot homes and rape women: hardly a monumental diplomatic achievement. With its bewildering mix of politicians and militias, Libya barely qualifies as a state. It has an unelected prime minister, two rival legislatures, and until mid-August two central banks. Even if Mr Dbeibeh agreed to relations with Israel, he could not plausibly sign a deal on behalf of the entire country. Mr Cohen erred in talking about the meeting. But the bigger error lies with an American government that sees value in pushing even the most illegitimate governments to join the accords. ■"
https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/the-eus-response-to-the-crisis-in-israel-exposes-its-limits,"Nothing screams “great power” like an aircraft-carrier. And so on October 10th Thierry Breton, the European commissioner hailing from France, raised the idea of the EU availing itself of such a seafaring airbase. Alas, even before the merits of a floating jet-launcher for a bloc with neither navy nor air force could be considered, the EU’s geopolitical ambitions fared as poorly as a plane lurching off the deck and into the drink. In the days around Mr Breton’s flight of fancy, a fumbled response to the terrorist attacks in Israel on October 7th left Europe looking muddled. A union that had found its foreign-policy voice over Ukraine has rediscovered its penchant for cacophony. A bout of chaotic diplomacy and internal squabbling has set back the cause of a “geopolitical EU” to match China and America. Europe’s response to the crisis started off badly and got steadily worse. Beyond the usual lighting-up of buildings in the colours of whichever country is mourning its dead, the first reaction of note to come out of Europe was the announcement that the EU would suspend all development aid to Palestinians—a serious move, considering the bloc is their largest donor. The policy was reversed the very same day amid rising concerns in national capitals about the living conditions of innocent Gazans caught up in the fighting. Later in the week, on October 13th, the commission’s boss, Ursula von der Leyen, travelled to Israel. The message she delivered there was dutifully sympathetic. But national capitals fumed that she had failed to emphasise their concern that any response from the Israeli side needs to keep within the boundaries of international law. Government after government briefed that she was speaking not for the EU, merely for herself. As the furore mounted, Mrs von der Leyen’s team speedily announced that the EU’s humanitarian aid to Gaza was to be tripled. The war in Ukraine had given the EU a measure of geopolitical swagger. In the face of war, the club had found new means to be relevant, for example by paying for arms to be sent to hit back at Russian invaders. That kind of unified resolve now looks like a one-off. Attempts at forging a coherent response to a crisis just beyond its shores have been caught up in bickering between national capitals and even between different EU institutions in Brussels. Far from projecting power to the outside world, European politicians have instead looked within: a virtual meeting of 27 national leaders was arranged on October 17th to get everyone on the same page, which was not Mrs von der Leyen’s. A fraught personal relationship between her and Charles Michel, who as European Council president chairs meetings of EU leaders, used to be the stuff of the Brussels cocktail circuit. Now it looks as if it made the bloc even more impotent than it might otherwise have been. The episode is damaging for Mrs von der Leyen, who since the war in Ukraine had been the face of a more forceful, geopolitical Europe. Her influence—and that of the EU—seemed to extend beyond Ukraine. A speech she gave in March calling for a “de-risking” rather than a “decoupling” of economic relations with China had set a new tone in the relationship there; she has worked closely with America, too. New buzz phrases like “strategic autonomy” and “Team Europe” had hinted at the bloc playing its full part in geopolitics, a third power in a bipolar world.  But in trying to project a similarly forceful EU in the Middle East, the unity that underpinned Europe’s previous efforts was lacking. Some countries in Europe, notably Mrs von der Leyen’s native Germany, align instinctively with Israel, and emphasise its right to defend itself. But others, such as Spain and Ireland, are more closely attuned to the plight of Palestinians, and warn of an impending humanitarian disaster. Many simply felt the dispute was beyond the paygrade of the EU’s central institutions. Ukraine united the continent: European leaders jointly visited Kyiv after the city beat back Russian attackers last year. This latest crisis divides it. This week the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, travelled to Israel alone. France’s Emmanuel Macron is considering a later trip. Mrs von der Leyen might have sensed that conflict in the Middle East was always going to be uniquely polarising. Israel is both close enough for Europe to care about—its scientists benefit from EU funding schemes, Israeli football teams play in European competitions and its crooners participate in the Eurovision Song Contest—yet too remote for a conflagration there to feel directly threatening. Every EU country has its own relationship with the region, coloured by their Muslim and Jewish populations. Most fear a spillover of the violence onto their own streets. Anti-Semitic incidents in Europe have flared since the Hamas strike; France and Belgium have both endured terrorist attacks. Others fret that a regional conflagration could result in a new wave of migration to Europe, as happened after wars in Syria and Afghanistan. Divided or otherwise, it is unlikely Europe would have had much sway on Israel’s response to being attacked. But its impotence is starting to look serial. The EU for years painted itself as a mediator in a territorial dispute pitting Azerbaijan against Armenia, yet could do little but meekly protest when Azerbaijan turfed tens of thousands of Armenians out of a disputed enclave last month. A deal with Tunisia to help cut migration across the Mediterranean has floundered: Tunisia returned €60m ($63m) the EU had paid it to seal the agreement. Even closer to home, disorder reigns as Kosovo and Serbia keep tussling despite entreaties from Brussels. The EU’s fans hoped that its impressive response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had exorcised a set of demons which have long haunted it: that it is a construct perfectly adept at standardising phone chargers and making farmers rich, but one that scarcely matters when it comes to high politics. A fortnight of disunion has made the EU look as plodding as ever: a club that does not shape geopolitics so much as endure its effects. ■ Read more from Charlemagne, our columnist on European politics: How rugby became a darling of Europe’s chauvinist right (Oct 12th)Europe is stuck in a need-hate relationship with migrants (Oct 4th)The definition of Europe has always been both inspiring and incoherent (Sep 27th) Also: How the Charlemagne column got its name"
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/26/why-israels-invasion-of-gaza-has-been-delayed,"IT ALL BEGAN so fast. An unprecedented barrage of rockets served as cover for a murderous rampage, which led to a frantic manhunt and ferocious air strikes. Reservists rushed to don uniforms and report for duty. Generals promised a massive ground offensive. What began as a sleepy autumn weekend ended with Israel making ready to invade Gaza. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas Nearly three weeks after the October 7th massacre in Israel, however, that offensive has yet to begin. Israel’s bombardment of Gaza continues, killing thousands and destroying around 9% of buildings in the territory. A near-total siege has left civilians short of food and water and hospitals unable to function. Apart from a few small raids, though, the ground troops have yet to move. Some of the 360,000 reservists called up in Israel’s largest-ever mobilisation have been sent home. Tens of thousands more are still in southern Israel, awaiting orders that have been delayed and delayed again. Officers grumble that they cannot maintain their readiness forever. One frustrated commander took his troops to a building site to run up and down half-finished high-rises—ostensibly an urban-warfare drill. In reality, he says, it was a way to let off steam. “Hurry up and wait” is a perennial maxim of military life; but an especially stark one in Israel today. There are many reasons to delay: continuing talks to free the array of hostages held by Hamas, the militant Islamist group that runs Gaza; American pressure, motivated by fears of a regional war; the dire conditions inside Gaza; and the chronic dithering of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s long-serving prime minister. On October 25th he confirmed that a ground offensive is still planned. But it will be smaller and slower than anyone would have expected in the days after the massacre, in which Hamas militants murdered more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. According to the latest count from Israeli officials, the tally of at least 220 people seized during the attack includes scores of children and old people, and citizens of at least a dozen foreign countries. The hostages have become a source of pressure on Mr Netanyahu’s government. The captives’ families have waged an effective public-relations campaign, and foreign leaders have pushed him to try to free their citizens. Vigils have been held across Israel. The hostages’ relatives often give television and radio interviews. The issue is deeply political. Many of those from the kibbutzim that were attacked are the secular, left-leaning sorts of Israelis most likely to have joined protests against Mr Netanyahu’s government throughout the year. They feel his government forsook them on October 7th and is still failing them. Pressure from the families has already forced the government to change its plans. Originally inclined to rush into Gaza without regard for the hostages’ safety, it has since declared that their rescue is a “top priority”. Qatar, host to some leaders of Hamas, is also feeling the heat. Its ties with the group have come under scrutiny since the massacre; it is desperate to show its Western partners, particularly America, that it can serve as an interlocutor. On October 25th Tzachi Hanegbi, the head of Israel’s national-security council, posted an uncharacteristic message on X (formerly Twitter): “I’m pleased to say that Qatar is becoming an essential party and stakeholder in the facilitation of humanitarian solutions,” he wrote. Israeli officials had been scathing about Qatar in recent weeks. That Mr Hanegbi praised it (in English, rather than Hebrew) suggests progress towards a deal to release at least some of Hamas’s captives. Hamas has already let a handful go. On October 20th it freed a mother and daughter who hold dual American and Israeli citizenship. Three days later it freed two elderly Israeli women who were abducted from Nir Oz, a kibbutz on the Gaza border. It got nothing in return—a sign that American pressure on Qatar is having an effect. One of the women, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, spoke of her ordeal at a press conference the next day. Her captors, she said, beat her on the journey to Gaza. Once inside the territory she was led into a “spiderweb” of tunnels; after walking for hours, she wound up in a room where around two dozen other hostages were being held. Ms Lifshitz said they were treated decently: medics tended to the wounded, and captives ate the same simple meals of bread, cheese and vegetables as their captors. When she was turned over to the Red Cross on Gaza’s border with Egypt, she shook hands with one of her captors. She said that was because the hostages were treated with “sensitivity”. But her husband is still in captivity: she had good reason not to antagonise Hamas. That the group behaved humanely to a grandmother, moreover, does not mitigate the outrage of having kidnapped a grandmother in the first place, tossing her across a motorbike and beating her with sticks. Nor does it excuse the horrors of what Hamas did in Israeli towns. On October 23rd the Israeli army screened 43 minutes of raw footage from the massacre for foreign journalists. Some was taken from the attackers’ body cameras, the rest from surveillance cameras and mobile phones. No recording was allowed at the screening, in a nondescript auditorium on an army base: this was a sadistic snuff film not for the public’s eyes. In one harrowing clip a father rushes his two young sons, all of them clad in their underclothes, to a hiding place. A terrorist throws in a hand grenade after them. The father is killed. The bloodied boys—one appears to have lost an eye—are led back into their house at gunpoint, where their father’s killer asks them for water, calmly raids the fridge and starts drinking a cola. (An army spokesman was unable to say if the boys survived.) The atrocities go on. A gunman tries to behead a Thai labourer who has been shot in the stomach; unable to find a knife, he hacks away at the man’s neck with a garden hoe. Other images show burned babies and children with their brains spilling from their heads. Several of the attackers proudly pose for photos next to their victims. The barbarity sparked rage in Israel and abroad. There is broad support for a military campaign to topple Hamas in Gaza, which it has controlled since it ousted the Palestinian Authority (PA) in 2007. But there are also powerful voices urging caution—Joe Biden’s most of all. His fear that Israel is rushing into a war with no clear endgame is a valid one. The Israeli security establishment would like to see the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, also retake control in Gaza. But one senior official admits that no serious planning has been done. Mr Netanyahu even denied that such a plan exists. Mr Biden also fears that the war will not stay in Gaza. On Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, there have been daily exchanges of fire. Hizbullah, the Shia militia cum political party, has attacked Israeli towns and army posts with anti-tank missiles, and Israel has shelled and bombed southern Lebanon. Hizbullah admits that some 40 of its fighters have been killed (the real toll is probably higher). It is the most sustained fighting since the war they fought in 2006, though it has yet to escalate beyond tit-for-tat bombardment. Militias in Syria and Iraq have used drones to attack American bases, where two dozen soldiers were lightly injured. On October 19th the Pentagon said an American destroyer, the USS Carney, had shot down missiles and drones launched from Yemen over the Red Sea. America believes their target was southern Israel, a remarkable entry into the war by the Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia in Yemen. All of these escalations are small—signs that Iran wants to show the reach of its proxies, not plunge the region into war. But they are risky. A strike that kills a lot of people in either Israel or Lebanon would be enough to upset the balance. To make that less likely, Israel has evacuated around two dozen communities in the north, including Kiryat Shmona, a city of more than 20,000 people near the Lebanese border. Villages on the Lebanese side have also emptied as residents flee farther north. Israel has hardened its border too: many reservists called up this month were sent north, not south. America has deployed two aircraft-carrier strike groups, one to the eastern Mediterranean, the other to the Persian Gulf. On October 21st it said it would deploy more Patriot air-defence battalions and a THAAD anti-ballistic missile battery. Another 2,000 troops are on standby for a possible deployment. Israel’s assessment is that these reinforcements have deterred Hizbullah from ramping up the fighting. Talk in the war cabinet of launching a pre-emptive strike on the group has died down. Of late, oil markets seem more sanguine, too. The price of Brent crude, which spiked from $85 a barrel before the Hamas attack to $92 on October 19th, has slipped to below $90. Every Israeli war is fought watching the clock, as international condemnation grows and eventually America qualifies its support. In 1973 America urged a ceasefire ending the Yom Kippur War, even though Israeli forces were on the advance. In 2006 it imposed a ceasefire before Israel could achieve its objectives in Lebanon. As one Israeli official puts it, “Our window of international legitimacy is limited.” The scenes of horror in Gaza mean the window is already closing. The UN says 1.4m people in the territory have been displaced; its shelters are crammed to two-and-a-half times their capacity. On October 13th Israel told the entire population of northern Gaza to flee south. Thousands who heeded that order have since travelled back the other way. If nowhere feels safe, they reckon, better to be in one’s own home than a tent or a crowded shelter. Israel refuses to allow any supplies to cross its border until Hamas releases all the hostages it holds captive. On October 21st the first shipment of aid, a convoy of 20 lorries containing food, water and medicine entered Gaza from Egypt. Several more deliveries followed. This is only a small fraction of what the territory needs (the UN says at least 100 lorries a day are required). Families have cut back to one meal a day. People have resorted to drinking salty water from wells. Aid workers say poor sanitation has led to cases of scabies and diarrhoea and fear that even more serious diseases will spread. No fuel has entered Gaza since October 7th. The sole power plant is offline and Israel has cut the supply of electricity that it normally provides. The World Health Organisation says six of Gaza’s 13 hospitals have run out of fuel. Most bakeries are closed for the same reason; queues at those still working stretch up to six hours. Israel refuses to allow fuel shipments. Arab states want an immediate ceasefire. The European Union is split, but Josep Borrell, its top diplomat, has called for a “humanitarian pause” to allow more supplies to enter. Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, has signalled support for one too. America still offers Israel staunch backing, but will not do so indefinitely. Yet Mr Netanyahu faces mounting pressure from his hard-right base to prove he is clobbering Hamas, and is loth to admit that Mr Biden or the hostages’ families have stayed his hand. Instead, using proxies, he has begun to brief that the army is not ready for a ground campaign. Rather than risk soldiers’ lives, it is argued, Israel should launch more devastating air strikes, including the use of bunker-busting bombs, to destroy Hamas’s tunnel network. The army has pushed back, saying it is “fully ready” for an invasion. There have been days of ugly but accurate headlines in the Israeli media about discord between Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Mr Netanyahu tried to fire Mr Gallant in March, after the latter voiced criticism of the government’s plan to weaken the supreme court. He was forced to retreat after massive public protests. There has been growing distrust between the two ever since, and it is now hampering Israel’s war-planning effort. On October 11th leaders of one opposition party, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot—both former army chiefs—joined the war cabinet. But they have failed to restore unity. “The [army] and the intelligence community were severely hit by their failure to detect and prevent the Hamas attack,” says a defence official. “But they’ve got back on their feet and are now just waiting for a clear idea from the government what to do.” The army’s orders remain to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and end its control of Gaza. Some within the army and the wider defence establishment believe a more gradual ground campaign would be better. But generals were told to prepare for a broad offensive; they cannot change that plan unless the cabinet gives them a different timetable or a different goal. And the cabinet is dithering. General Herzi Halevi, the army chief, has acknowledged the army’s failure to prevent the massacre. So has Ronen Bar, the director of Shin Bet, Israel’s internal-security service, and General Aharon Haliva, the head of military intelligence. All three are expected to do the honourable thing and resign after the war. Most Israelis want their prime minister to accept similar responsibility—but he has not. Instead Mr Netanyahu spends most of his time huddling with political advisers and briefing journalists. He has assembled his own shadow cabinet of former generals and security officials to second-guess Mr Gallant and the army. “There are many who shoulder the blame for thinking that Hamas wouldn’t dare do something like this,” says one Knesset member from Mr Netanyahu’s coalition. “Obviously Bibi is more to blame than all the others, but don’t wait for him to say so.” Even a well-oiled government would struggle to navigate between so many competing priorities—and Israel, these days, barely has a government at all. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/01/is-a-two-state-solution-possible-after-the-gaza-war,"In trying to plan for the future, world leaders are looking to the past. “When this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next, and in our view it has to be a two-state solution,” said Joe Biden, America’s president, in one of his many public statements about the nearly month-long war in Gaza. Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, has made similar comments; so has Emmanuel Macron, the French president. An emergency meeting of the Arab League last month ended with a call for “serious negotiations” towards a two-state solution. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas When Israel left Gaza in 2005, uprooting some 8,000 Jewish settlers from a territory it had controlled since 1967, no one knew quite what to make of the decision. Some hoped that Israel’s willingness to cede occupied territory would be a trend, a step towards a final settlement with the Palestinians. Others saw a canny ploy: relinquishing control of Gaza might help Israel entrench its control of the West Bank. The latter view turned out to be correct. Similar confusion has emerged since October 7th, when Israel began planning a ground invasion of Gaza after Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls the territory, massacred 1,400 Israelis. Palestinians fear the war will lead to a second naqba (“catastrophe”), referring to the mass displacement that accompanied Israel’s birth in 1948. Far-right Israeli ministers hope it will offer a chance to reassert control over Gaza and rebuild the dismantled Jewish settlements. A few hopeful sorts, among them Mr Biden, hope it will provide a chance to revive the comatose Israeli-Palestinian peace process. For now, that is a far-off dream: Israeli generals expect months of fighting. But both they and many foreign powers hope eventually to transfer control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority (pa), which governs parts of the West Bank, probably with a peacekeeping force brought in to help the transition. And they doubt that Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, would return to Gaza without a guarantee of meaningful talks about Palestinian statehood. Any plan for the “day after” in Gaza, in other words, needs to consider the possibility of a two-state solution. The broad outline has not changed much for decades. A Palestinian state would be formed in Gaza and the West Bank; Israel would swap chunks of its territory for portions of the West Bank where it has built large settlements. Jerusalem would be divided, with some sort of joint control over the old city. A small number of Palestinian refugees could return to Israel, while the rest would settle in either Palestine or their present homes elsewhere. Israel would expect a Palestinian state to be demilitarised. After two decades of serious talks—from the hopeful era of the Oslo accords in the early 1990s, through a desultory attempt under Barack Obama—the peace process ground to a halt in 2014. There have been no serious negotiations since. Negotiators cannot quite pick up where they left off. At the end of 2021 there were 465,400 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank, up from 116,300 when the Oslo accords were signed in 1993. They are a growing obstacle to peace. Most are concentrated in areas that would probably be ceded to Israel in an agreement, but their political clout (they would oppose surrendering even land that they do not live on) has increased along with their population. The regional picture is also more complicated. In 2002 the Arab League endorsed a Saudi proposal that promised Israel normal relations with Arab countries after a two-state solution: by ending its conflict with the Palestinians, Israel could end all its regional conflicts. The Arab Peace Initiative was meant to be a powerful inducement. Israel might be more willing to take its boot off the Palestinians if it felt that other threats would then dissipate. But the region has changed since 2002. Some militias, from Hizbullah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen, are now more powerful than the states they call home. It would not suffice for Arab governments to end their conflicts with Israel: non-state actors would have to agree to do so as well. Other things could be easier. A two-state solution would be costly. Even before the war, the Palestinians would have expected help to rehabilitate Gaza; the bill will be much higher now. At the failed Camp David summit in 2000 negotiators discussed a $30bn fund to compensate Palestinian refugees for lost property. Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (uae), which have boosted ties with Israel in recent years, might be more willing to stump up the cash to show they have not abandoned the Palestinians. The biggest problem, however, remains not the details of a solution but the political will to negotiate and implement one. There will be no serious peace process with Binyamin Netanyahu’s coalition of far-right and religious politicians. That coalition is unlikely to survive long after the Gaza war, and Mr Netanyahu’s opponents hope that the next government will be more amenable to talks with the Palestinians. “We learned a lesson that we need to separate from them in a good way,” says one centrist Israeli lawmaker. “It’s time to start that discussion.” But Israeli politicians from the centre and left have avoided the issue in public for more than a decade. On the Palestinian side, Hamas has always been eager to play spoiler. Its first suicide-bombings in the 1990s helped to scuttle the Oslo process, and the carnage it wrought during the second intifada (“uprising”) from 2000 to 2005 turned a generation of Israelis against the idea of compromise. Perhaps Hamas will fade away after the war in Gaza—but another group could take its place. Ordinary people on both sides have lost faith in the two-state solution. A poll in September 2022 by the Israel Democracy Institute, a non-partisan think-tank, found that only 32% of Israeli Jews would support one, down from 47% five years earlier. Israeli Arabs, who make up one-fifth of the population, still endorsed the idea, although their support has also dropped, from 87% in 2017 to 71% in 2022. A plurality of Israeli Jews preferred the status quo. Support has plummeted even further among Palestinians. A survey in June 2023 by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research found that just 28% still support a two-state solution. Some 53% of them backed the idea ten years ago, though just 39% thought it feasible. Optimists hope that these results are squishy: people are unlikely to support something they think impossible. A meaningful peace process could push the poll numbers back up. “I don’t think our people would reject a chance to end the occupation,” says one former Palestinian minister. But the events of recent weeks could just as well harden both sides against the idea of compromise. As ever in Israel, some of the strongest supporters of ending the occupation are the men tasked with running it. In the wake of the Hamas attack, few Israelis are talking publicly about the two-state solution—or any other solution for the conflict. But defence officials are discussing it in closed rooms. That is partly because the desired end state of the war will shape the war itself and because the Netanyahu government is incapable of holding a serious debate on Israel’s long-term strategy. Then there is the question of who will play mediator. Though Russia and China both aspire to a role in Middle East peacemaking, neither has much leverage or credibility to assume it. The European Union could position itself as an honest broker but it is not taken seriously. That leaves America. Mr Biden spent the first three years of his presidency trying to ignore the conflict. He will have other things on his mind in 2024—and neither Israelis nor Palestinians are likely to embark on a peace process with a president who could soon be turfed out. If Mr Biden wins in 2024, he could try to lead efforts. Donald Trump would be another story. In January 2020, after years of trailing a supposedly serious peace plan devised by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, he finally unveiled it. The plan, almost laughably biased in favour of Israel, was dead on arrival. It would have given the Palestinians just 75% of the occupied West Bank, in three cantons linked by highways. Israel would have kept the Jordan valley, the breadbasket of the territory, and compensated the Palestinians for their loss by ceding a few patches of barren desert in the Negev. Palestine’s capital would have been limited to a few destitute suburbs of east Jerusalem. The Palestinians, unsurprisingly, refused even to discuss the proposal. ■"

https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/09/antisemitism-surges-in-france-after-the-hamas-attacks-on-israel,"A short walk from the halal butcher and Istanbul supermarket, amid the brutalist tower blocks of Sarcelles, lies what remains of “Little Jerusalem”. Tucked under a rain-streaked concrete block, across the road from the Grand Synagogue and a Hebrew bookshop, a kosher bakery is doing brisk business. Around the corner, diners at Chez Inoun tuck into grilled lamb over a glass of kosher merlot from Galilee. Sephardic Jews first arrived in Sarcelles from French north Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, when the place was considered a model of a modernist new town. At first glance, life goes on pretty much as normal. Yet, as antisemitism surges across France, this banlieue (suburb) north of Paris is both a test of whether locally cordial intercommunal ties can last, and a hub of dread. “We are very afraid,” says an elderly resident clutching a bag of pastries in the bakery. He wears a cloth cap over his kippah to disguise it, he says, and feels more anxious than at any other time during the 55 years he has lived in Sarcelles. Since October 7th the French interior ministry has recorded 1,159 antisemitic acts in France, three times as many in one month as during the whole of 2022. During two separate recent incidents, stars of David were stencilled overnight on to residential dwellings in and near Paris, recalling the darkest days in the capital under Nazi occupation; investigators are now looking into whether this was a Russian destabilisation operation. In Sarcelles, with its 12,000-strong Jewish population, the police and military presence has been reinforced. Albert, head waiter at Chez Inoun, says that his place is less busy than usual on a weekday lunchtime: “People are afraid of what might happen.” France is home to both Europe’s biggest Jewish and its biggest Muslim populations. Each time conflict in the Middle East flares up, authorities worry that tensions there will be imported to France. In 2000, after the second Palestinian intifada (uprising) began, the number of recorded antisemitic incidents in France jumped nearly tenfold from the previous year, to 744. At that time, the nature of antisemitism shifted too. What was once primarily the sinister work of those linked to French neo-Nazism and the extreme right became more complex, mixing anti-Zionism, antisemitism and far-left politics. The share of racist acts attributed to the extreme right fell from 67% in 1992 to 9% in 2002, according to Nicolas Lebourg, a historian. The “new antisemitism”, says Moïse Kahloun, president of the Grand Synagogue in Sarcelles, comes from the extreme left. After the recent murderous Hamas attacks on Israel, he says, the “negationist” discourse from the far left has fed an “atmospheric antisemitism” and spread the “hatred of Jews”. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the hard-left Unsubmissive France, stirred outcry even on the left after he failed to describe the Hamas attacks as acts of terrorism. One of his deputies, Danièle Obono, said that Hamas was merely a “resistance movement”. France’s struggle against antisemitism has become politically divisive. A cross-party march in Paris against antisemitism, organised by the heads of the two houses of parliament, is planned for November 12th. Marine Le Pen of the hard-right National Rally party, whose father once called the Holocaust a “detail” of history, promises to attend. To some surprise, she has come down firmly in defence of Israel. Friends of Mr Mélenchon are using her presence as a pretext for not turning out. For Jews in Sarcelles, there is some comfort to be drawn from the work the town has done to try to bring its myriad tongues and faiths together. Recent efforts are partly a response to an outbreak of antisemitic violence that shook the place in 2014. What began as a pro-Palestinian march at the time turned into a riot, including arson attacks in Little Jerusalem on a kosher delicatessen and a Jewish-owned pharmacy. A place that had taken pride in the coexistence of families descended from 90 different nationalities took a long hard look at itself. Today, says Patrick Haddad, who has been the town’s Socialist mayor since 2018, Sarcelles takes intercommunal relations seriously. Religious leaders, including those from the four local mosques, speak regularly to each other. The town hall runs campaigns against racism and antisemitism, and holds regular public debates. Out on the street near the town hall, two young men, each wearing a kippah, say that they do not feel unsafe locally. So far since October 7th, says Mr Haddad, Sarcelles has been spared significant acts of antisemitism. In some ways, due to its religious geography, Sarcelles is an exception in France. Yet it also captures many contemporary anxieties about the fate of French Jewry. During the exodus from French north Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, some of those who arrived in Sarcelles had family members who chose to go instead to Israel. Others have seen relatives leave more recently. Because of this, says Mr Haddad, the Hamas attacks were “almost physical” for them. Mr Kahloun, who has lived in Sarcelles since the 1970s, is among them: his daughter now lives in Israel. Perhaps most painfully, the atrocities by Hamas have put an end to the “myth” of Israel as a refuge for French Jews, says Mr Haddad. “Each time there are antisemitic acts in France,” he says, “there are always Jews who say ‘I’m going to live in Israel and I will be safe there’.” This no longer feels true. “In the end,” adds the mayor, “there aren’t many places to go to.”  ■"
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/18/the-arab-world-thinks-differently-about-this-war,"Visit our dedicated hub for coverage of Israel and Hamas. THE SCENES looped on news channels all night: ambulances, bodies, an explosion lighting the night sky. Hamas blamed Israel for the blast at Gaza’s al-Ahli hospital on October 17th. The Gaza health ministry said hundreds of people were killed. Israel later denied that it was carrying out air strikes in the area; the explosion, it said, was caused by a misfired rocket launched by Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza. By the time Israel issued its denial, though, details had ceased to matter. The catastrophe had sparked protests in the West Bank and Jordan, and as far away as Tunisia. That was the maelstrom into which Joe Biden flew when he arrived in Israel on October 18th for a quick visit. It is hard to generalise about “the Arab world”, a collection of 450m people spread across thousands of kilometres and nearly two dozen countries. But it is safe to say that most Arabs still sympathise with the Palestinian cause. Their dispossession remains a totemic political issue across the Middle East, able to mobilise popular anger and protest like little else. The war between Israel and Hamas, now in its 12th day, has been no different. Covered around the clock on television, discussed endlessly on social media, it has sparked an outpouring of support for Palestinians. Still, compared with past conflicts, like the 50-day war in Gaza in 2014, a few things look different. One is geopolitics. Since 2020 four Arab states—Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—have established relations with Israel, which previously had ties with just two (Egypt and Jordan). Saudi Arabia has been in talks to do the same. That has changed the way some Arab media outlets cover the conflict. Al Jazeera, the Qatari broadcaster, has given ample time to Hamas, which is supported by Qatar. Meanwhile, channels run by Saudi Arabia and the UAE have tried to walk a tightrope. Though they cover scenes of devastation in Gaza, they do not book Hamas officials for interviews (Arabic-speaking Israeli Jews are frequent guests, though). There have been heated debates in newsrooms over language: where once they might have used the phrase jaish al-ihtilal (“occupation army”), for example, today they just refer to it as the Israeli army. A second difference is fear of a broader conflict. The 2014 war was limited to the holy land. It may not stay there this time—and that has complicated the discussion, at least in those countries close to Israel. Take Egypt. America and several Arab countries are urging it to open Rafah, the sole border crossing with Gaza not controlled by Israel, to allow civilians to escape the fighting. But a broad swath of Egyptian society is adamant that their country should resist such pressure. “Why did you impose this war on me?” asked Ibrahim Eissa, a pro-government talk-show host, in a message directed at Hamas. “You want me to risk 100m Egyptians for your sake?” Other pundits have made similar remarks. One could dismiss them as mere mouthpieces for the regime—but their words have been widely echoed by the public. The discourse is similar in Lebanon, which is four years into one of the worst economic crises in modern history. Many Lebanese are worried that Hizbullah, the powerful Shia militia and political party, will open a second front against Israel, thus dragging their country into another ruinous war like the one in 2006. “Don’t enter us into this hell,” wrote Dima Sadek, a well-known journalist who is both deeply supportive of the Palestinians and deeply critical of Hizbullah. That points to a third shift: the region is more polarised today. Many Syrians, in particular, are appalled by the scenes in Gaza, where Israel’s siege warfare reminds them of the tactics deployed by Bashar al-Assad. But they are simultaneously loth to cheer for Hamas, a group backed by Iran, which did so much to destroy their country. And they fume at commentators across the Arab world who abhor Israeli atrocities but cheered Mr Assad’s. In Lebanon, too, some people are focused on the wider politics: whatever their views of Israel, they hope Iran (and thus Hizbullah) will emerge weakened. In off-the-record conversations over the past 12 days, some Arab officials have spoken about Hamas and Gaza in the sort of language one would expect to hear from right-wing Israelis. They harbour no sympathy for an Islamist group backed by Iran. But they dare not repeat such remarks in public. The disconnect between palace and public helps explain why Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, received a frosty reception on his recent round of shuttle diplomacy. First it was Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, who kept Mr Blinken and his entourage waiting hours for a planned Saturday-night meeting (the prince did not receive them until the next morning). It is not unusual for Prince Muhammad, a night owl with an erratic schedule, to leave guests to cool their heels. That he did it to such a high-profile visitor, though, was seen as a pointed message. Then, after landing in Cairo, Mr Blinken was subjected to an unusual public lecture by Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the Egyptian president, who lamented the plight of the Palestinians. Mr Biden will not even receive that chilly welcome. He had been scheduled to fly to Jordan after Israel, where he was to meet King Abdullah; Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president; and Mr Sisi. But Mr Abbas backed out shortly after the hospital blast, and then Jordan announced that the whole summit was off. Whatever Mr Biden had hoped to say to Arab leaders, they are in no mood to hear it. Yet behind the public posturing lies deep unease. Since October 7th many analysts have drawn parallels with the Yom Kippur war, the last time Israel experienced such a calamitous intelligence failure. But there is also a profound contrast with that moment. In 1973 Arab states were able to launch a war that seemed, to Israel, an existential threat. Historians have argued ever since about whether that was true. But it felt that way at the time—enough so that Moshe Dayan, the defence minister, is said to have mooted the use of nuclear weapons. Half a century later, Israel was dragged to war by a militant group, and the region now faces the prospect of a broader conflict waged by other non-state actors supported by non-Arab Iran. As for Arab states, they are nervous onlookers. Najib Mikati, the Lebanese prime minister, was blunt about the possibility of war in Lebanon: “These decisions are not in my hands,” he told al-Jadeed, a local television network. The leaders of Egypt and Jordan fear fallout from the war will destabilise their own brittle regimes. Gulf states are nervous about antagonising Iran, lest its proxies lash out at Riyadh or Abu Dhabi. This is not an existential moment for Israel—but some Arab rulers fear it might be for them. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/07/israel-and-palestine-how-peace-is-possible,"IF YOU WANT to understand how desperately Israelis and Palestinians need peace, consider what would become of them in a state of perpetual war. Against a vastly superior Israeli army, the Palestinians’ most powerful weapon would remain the death and suffering of their own people. Israel’s fate would be woeful, too, if it wants to be a flourishing, modern democracy. If Israel permanently relies on its army to subjugate the Palestinians, it would become an apartheid-enforcing pariah. Israelis carrying out daily acts of oppression punctuated by rounds of killing would themselves be corrupted. For two peoples locked in a violent embrace, peace is the only deliverance. But how to get there? Israelis are still reeling from the rape and murder of October 7th; Palestinians are watching the mangled bodies of women and children pile up in Gaza. Amid the carnage, outsiders’ urging of peace seems naive. Besides, jaded Palestinians and Israelis see endless talks as a mechanism for delaying peace, not forging it. Negotiators in the past have thrashed out almost every imaginable permutation of land swaps and security arrangements. All failed. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas And yet something changed after October 7th. Israel’s strategy of marginalising the Palestinians and their dreams is broken. Both sides have a chance to find new leaders with a new vision. And after years of neglect, outsiders may be ready to help, crucially including a group of Arab countries. They must not fall into the trap of thinking that peace requires sweating the detail yet again. Success depends on the two sides wanting peace and—much harder—believing in it. If the fighting is to make any sense it must lead to peace, which means two nations living side by side. Israel’s bombardment has killed over 16,000 Palestinians, including Hamas fighters. Although some Palestinians have been radicalised by that and the daily humiliations of occupation, many detest Hamas and its unwinnable wars and would live with Israel if they could prosper. So long as the men with guns do not get in their way, those people will seek peace. Israel, too, needs a new strategy. The old one failed to fulfil the state’s basic promise to create a land safe for Jews; 1,400 people were killed or kidnapped by Hamas, hundreds of thousands more have been evacuated. Peace also requires new leaders, because the present ones are discredited. In Israel Binyamin Netanyahu is an obstacle to a genuine reconciliation, the sooner he goes the better. America could usefully signal that it expects Israel to hold elections soon. Polls suggest that he will be replaced by Benny Gantz, a former general who understands the toll of war. Mr Gantz has not endorsed a Palestinian state, but neither has he ruled one out. New Palestinian leadership is needed, too. Hamas is an avowed enemy of peace: for as long as it runs Gaza, Palestinian pledges to embrace peace will not be believable. On the West Bank, Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian Authority (PA), is corrupt, ossified and lacks any democratic legitimacy. Amid the rubble of war, Gaza will need time to rebuild and re-establish some kind of stable administration. Moderate Arab countries should sponsor a transitional Palestinian leadership for the West Bank and Gaza that can begin building trust among its own people and, vitally, with the Israelis, before holding elections. By running both Gaza and the West Bank, it would become a more credible partner for peace. That leads to the process. The Oslo accords, marked in 1993 with a wary handshake on the White House lawn, left the hardest details until last. Every inch of progress had to be wrung out of the two sides. This sapped belief that success was possible. A new process must make early progress. Both sides will have to take on their own extremists, who would sabotage coexistence. The PA must shut down armed groups, foil terrorists and tackle corruption. Boosting the economy demands numerous agreements with Israel over trade, utilities and work permits. Palestinians need to know they are gaining freedoms and rights. Land swaps can wait, but Israel should deal with the settlements too deep in the West Bank ever to be part of Israel. It must start policing them and stop them from expanding further. It needs to be clear that the 100,000 or so settlers who live in them will eventually have to move or come under Palestinian rule. This is too hard for the Israelis and Palestinians to do on their own, so the outside world must be involved. Under Oslo, America was the sponsor, but it struggled to exert pressure on Israel, which can muster formidable support in Congress. This time, the Arab world should play a decisive role. Under the Abraham accords, negotiated during the Trump administration, several countries recognised Israel. That was part of a vision for the Middle East based around trade and prosperity rather than ideology. Their money will be required to rebuild Gaza. Their soldiers can help provide security when Israel leaves the strip, which should happen as early as possible. If they work together, they can starve Hamas of money and shelter, diverting funds to reconstruction instead. Their heft can give a transitional Palestinian leader diplomatic cover while he establishes himself and his administration. The key is early pressure exerted by America and Saudi Arabia on Israel and the Palestinians. The PA argues that peace could be kick-started if America and the European Union sent Israel a signal by recognising a Palestinian state upfront—an idea endorsed by Spain, which holds the EU presidency. America should fulfil its promise to open a diplomatic mission for the Palestinians in Jerusalem. But full recognition of Palestine by the West and of Israel by Saudi Arabia should be held out as rewards for the future, as an incentive for progress. Time for that is short. Israel’s anti-Palestinian right will remain strong. Once this government falls, the next may have only a single term to rekindle Israelis’ faith that peace is possible. In the PA a new leader will face enemies who got fat under today’s rotten system. Whatever remains of Hamas will seek to wreck peace, as will Iran and its proxies, who thrive on chaos and strife. The Biden administration may be willing to press Israel; a Trump administration might not. If permanent war is not to ruin two nations, Israelis, Palestinians and all who cherish them must seize the moment. ■ For subscribers only: to see how we design each week’s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/05/13/a-kingdom-of-two-halves,"WESTERN powers have long found money a good way of persuading the Hashemites, who rule Jordan, to do their bidding. A century ago, T.E. Lawrence, a charismatic British officer, persuaded them to rebel against the rule of the Ottoman Turks by letting them loot the trains they blew up. In more modern times, hefty dollops of aid have persuaded them to provide military facilities for the Americans in their war in Iraq and to accommodate the region’s periodic splurges of refugees, most recently from Syria. Surely, Western officials say, for the right price, currently estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, the Jordanians will help John Kerry, America’s secretary of state (pictured above with King Abdullah) to fix a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by absorbing the 4.5m Palestinians who live in the kingdom, including the 3.5m who are now Jordanian citizens. Or will they? Indigenous Bedouin from Jordan’s East Bank, who number about 3m, worry that America’s plans to persuade Palestinian leaders to strip generations of refugees of their claimed “right of return” to what is now Israel would reduce Jordan’s original inhabitants to a permanent minority. Tribal leaders fret that the refugees, barred from Israel, would campaign for full rights in Jordan, over time turning the kingdom into a second Palestinian state. The Bedouin would lose their preferential access to government jobs. They might also be deprived of the skewed electoral system that has hitherto ensured that they control Jordan’s parliament. “Kerry is destroying our home,” says a Jordanian analyst. “He is trying to solve one conflict by creating another.” Parliamentarians from Jordan’s East Bank (ie, non-Palestinians) intent on scuppering Mr Kerry’s plan say the Palestinians must uphold their right to return to Israel. Campaigners are denounced as American collaborators for calling for more rights for those 1m Palestinians resident in the kingdom who still do not have Jordanian nationality. When Mustafa Hamarneh, a Jordanian MP, suggested giving the children of Palestinian refugees access to Jordanian state education, health care and a driving licence, he was labelled a Zionist agent. Nervous lest they be accused of selling out, many of Jordan’s own Palestinians are also opposing Mr Kerry. After four generations in Jordan, most are unprepared to go anywhere else, but do not want to admit it. Many also fear that Jordan’s government may pocket any compensation supposedly earmarked for Palestinians to persuade them to drop their demand to get back their old homes in Israel. Jordanian officials suggest that Jordan should receive $500m for each of the 65 years they have hosted the refugees, while the country’s Palestinians suggest that each family should be compensated for the properties that Israelis took after 1948. The Palestinians in Jordan also argue that, far from being a burden, they have been responsible for building up Jordan’s economy. Jordan’s king may also have reason to flinch at Mr Kerry’s plans. Not only would a Palestinian state compete for some of the aid that now comes his way, but it might also steal the kingdom’s vaunted role as a buffer between Israel and a turbulent Arab world. If a Palestinian state were to emerge, replete with an American-backed force between Israel and the Jordan river, it could claim that role. The Jordanians are reluctant to lose it."
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/05/18/the-half-life-on-an-occupied-palestine,"ISRAEL, THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY and Hamas may be bitter rivals, but they all agree on one thing: the Erez border crossing between Gaza and Israel, for the lucky few allowed to use it, is a prime opportunity to recruit spies. At the Israeli terminal a poster showing a handshake offers the “Chance of Your Lifetime” to Palestinians willing to provide information on militants. Beyond a buffer zone, at the PA and Hamas posts, murals warn Palestinians against betraying the homeland. Erez marks one of the world’s strangest frontiers, separating the lush fields of Israeli kibbutzim from the free-fire zones, rubble and chaos of Gaza—a territory that is neither a state, nor an autonomous domain of the PA, nor even a fully occupied territory after Israel pulled out in 2005. Instead it is a large detention camp, guarded from without by Israeli forces (and by Egyptian troops), and from within by Hamas, the strongest of the armed gangs, which pushed out the PA in 2007. The PA’s border post provides a convenient buffer between Israel and Hamas. The façade of the Israeli terminal masks a surreal automated facility. No Israeli is in sight as Palestinians emerging from Gaza make their way through remote-controlled gates and scanners. Commands are barked through distorted tannoys, or made with obscure hand signals from behind the blast-proof window of a control room high above. Since the Israelis left, Israel and Hamas have engaged in four major rounds of fighting and endless smaller clashes. Everybody expects another war, though few seem to want it. The Shujaiya neighbourhood, pounded to rubble in 2014, is being rebuilt with scarce materials from charitable donations or, for those who can afford it, the black market. The liveliest bit of Gaza’s economy is the recycling of war rubble. Electricity is intermittent, and clean water is in short supply. Majed al-Heisso, a father of six, makes a living from occasional but dangerous work tilling fields nearby. In the game of Gazan roulette, those recognised by Israeli spotters as regular farmers are allowed to work land close to Israel’s buffer zone; others risk being shot. Hamas is keeping a ceasefire, but struggles to stop smaller Salafist factions from using places like Shujaiya to launch rockets at Israel. Residents flee to escape Israeli retaliatory fire. “There is firing every day. I want it to end. We don’t want any more wars. The children have nightmares every day,” says Mr Heisso. “The militants fire rockets, get paid and have happy lives. We are the victims.” There is growing talk in Israel of relieving the economic siege of Gaza, including proposals to build a port on an offshore island (controlled by Israel). One reason is to avoid a return to war. Another is ideological: by treating Gaza as if it were a Palestinian state, Israeli right-wingers think they might more easily fend off pressure for territorial concessions in the West Bank. This all feeds Hamas’s conviction that violence is the only language that Israel understands. “Gaza was liberated by resistance,” says Mahmoud Zahhar, a senior Hamas political figure who has lost two sons in the fighting and whose house has been bombed four times. By contrast, he says, the Palestinian Authority’s security co-operation with Israel in the West Bank has led only to the expansion of settlements. Yet Hamas, too, is under pressure. On May 1st it issued a new policy paper that updates, but does not abolish, its founding charter of 1988. It drops the crudest anti-Semitic passages and accepts the creation of a Palestinian state in just the West Bank and Gaza as a “formula of national consensus”. Yet Hamas is no convert to a two-state solution; it remains committed to the “full and complete liberation of Palestine”, if necessary by “resistance and jihad”. Its vision of a Palestinian state is maximalist and, like Gaza, in permanent conflict with Israel. For Mr Zahhar, “Israel is a foreign body,” although Hamas could talk to it about humanitarian issues: bird flu, say, or the exchange of prisoners. For Israel, the document is a non-starter. By distancing Hamas from the Muslim Brotherhood, it signals accommodation with Egypt, which has eased the closure of the Rafah crossing. And it seeks to appeal to militant factions of Fatah as the Palestinian Authority squeezes Gaza, cutting salaries to Palestinian civil servants and throttling subsidies for fuel and electricity. The timing matters: it came as the Hamas politburo named a new leader, Ismail Haniyah, the former head of Hamas in Gaza; and as Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, prepares for a possible resumption of peace talks with Israel (see article). In his capital of Ramallah in the West Bank, Mr Abbas, who is 82, is treated with indifference by Israel and contempt by many Palestinians. Life in Ramallah may be easier than in Gaza, but corruption in the PA rankles, as does the erosion of democracy. Mr Abbas is in the 13th year of his four-year term. Potential rivals are circling. Mr Abbas’s lieutenants think a two-state deal is still feasible. “We are in the last 15 minutes,” declares Jibril Rajoub, a former head of internal security in the West Bank (now head of the Palestinian Olympic Committee) and a potential a successor. The world is “fed up” with Israel’s occupation, he says, and Donald Trump may provide an unexpected breakthrough. “He said America first, not Israel first.” Such claims are met with guffaws on the streets. “A Palestinian state? That’s just a movie. Things were much better before the Palestinian Authority came here,” says Khalil Abu Ibrahim, a fruit-and-vegetable seller who has set up in a prime spot: next to the captive clientele of the gridlocked roundabout at Kalandia checkpoint, in the shadow of a smoke-charred Israeli watchtower. Those allowed to cross Kalandia by car can take more than an hour. The passage for those on foot looks like a cattle pen. Israel could do much more to make the crossing less awful—more lanes for cars, more staff to process travellers, more effort to clean up the place—without endangering its security. Here Israel’s talk about the eternal unity of Jerusalem is exposed as hypocrisy. The wall cuts off areas that are formally part of the city, forming twilight zones for East Jerusalem’s Palestinians where housing is cheaper but public services are neglected. Arij, a student, picks her way past the fetid rubbish by the wall as she returns to East Jerusalem from Birzeit University, a commute of two-and-a-half hours each way. She does not speak Hebrew, so could not go to an Israeli university. “I don’t know any Jews. I am not ready to make friends with them,” she says. Most Israelis are not interested either. The Arabic that they are usually taught is a pidgin designed for places like Kalandia, with phrases in the imperative: “Jib al-hawiya”(give me your ID).

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/24/the-challenge-of-making-palestinian-wine,"The vines are heavy with grapes, the harvest just a few days away. Yet Sari Khoury is stressed: he cannot find workers to pick grapes in his vineyards. Proud owner of the Philokalia label, he is one of a handful of Palestinians in the West Bank producing wine under the trickiest of circumstances: Israel’s occupation. A “separation wall” between Israel proper and most of the Palestinian territory it occupies towers above Mr Khoury’s cellar in Bethlehem. Mr Khoury’s vineyards are hemmed in by Gush Etzion, a cluster of Jewish settlements nudging the south of the city. Constant niggles of the occupation abound. In 2014 Mr Khoury gave up his job as an architect in Paris to return home to requite his passion for wine. A year later he was producing hundreds of bottles as one of the West Bank’s handful of wine producers to use only indigenous grapes. Now he fills 10,000 bottles a year. The business of wine-making is testing enough at the best of times. The headaches of production under military occupation are even more painful. Mr Khoury is short of labourers because Palestinians can earn five times as much across the wall in Israel. And it is virtually impossible to get a permit from the Israeli authorities to expand his type of business physically.  “I can’t even build a shed for my tools,” he explains. “I have to bring them with me in the car every time.” Other big obstacles are the Israeli checkpoints that hamper his logistics and the scarcity of water that is guzzled by the nearby Jewish settlements. Many Israeli wineries grow European grapes that need a lot of irrigation. But the lack of water supplies for Palestinians in the West Bank means that they struggle to grow the likes of Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon. Hence Mr Khoury’s focus on local varieties such as Dabouki and Jandali that need less water and can survive the baking sun. Mr Khoury also emphasises sustainability, but warns against growing indigenous grapes as a gimmick. “I want to create the highest quality wine possible, to be judged on its merits,” he says. “That’s my resistance,” he adds, referring to Palestinian efforts to push back against the Israeli occupation.■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/20/arab-tourism-to-israel-is-still-thwarted-by-politics-and-palestine,"The indigo festival near the seaside southern foot of Egypt’s Sinai peninsula sounded jolly enough. Its organisers promised five days of “psychedelic music, sun and sea” in a mood of peace and love. Yet the fiesta has proved controversial, largely because the show was being run by Israelis. The Egyptian branch of a global campaign to boycott and divest from Israel denounced the organisers as “racist Zionist occupiers”. After Israeli police recently clashed with young Palestinians near Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque, the festival was axed. Israeli-Arab tourism is still blighted by politics and tensions over Palestine. Similar jamborees on Sinai’s southern coast, an easy drive from Israel’s border crossing at Taba, have become increasingly popular with Israelis, partly because they are cheaper than in Israel. Almost 700,000 Israelis visited southern Sinai last year. Tourists from Cairo and Tel Aviv rub along happily at the diving centres and beach resorts on the Red Sea. Some local Egyptian businesses advertise their wares in Hebrew and take payment in Israeli shekels. Visitors can buy T-shirts that say “I love Dahab”, one of the most popular spots, in Hebrew. Some Egyptians, however, are less keen. Last year many were irked by photos of an Israeli flag on the beach during the Hashmaliko festival. Egypt’s anti-Israel twitterati raged at two other gigs held in the week when their compatriots celebrated Sinai Liberation Day, marking the end of Israel’s occupation of the peninsula in 1982. Organisers’ efforts to promote such occasions as peace-building bridges between the two cultures have failed—especially since Egyptians are often not allowed to buy tickets. Few Arabs across the wider region seem interested in beachside bonhomie. The Israeli tourist industry hoped that the Abraham accords of 2020, which officially normalised Israel’s relations with Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), would cause an influx of holiday-making Arabs keen to see the Holy Land. It hasn’t happened. One reason is Arabs’ continuing anger about the Palestinians. Most Egyptians abhor the treaty that made peace with Israel in 1979. Polls say the share of Emiratis who view the Abraham accords favourably dropped from 47% when they were signed to 25% at last count. Still, the accords have encouraged Israelis to head for the Gulf. Last year 150,000 of them visited the UAE. A few chanced a first-time visit to Bahrain. But Israeli tourism to Egypt beyond Sinai has still not taken off. Last year a mere 45,000 Israelis flew directly to Cairo. Even fewer Arabs visited Israel as tourists. Those from Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and the UAE, which provided most Arab visitors, numbered just 26,400, compared with 2.7m from elsewhere in the world; 5,100 were Egyptian and 1,600 Emiratis. Bahrainis, says Israel’s tourism ministry, were “too few to count”."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/18/what-is-palestinian-islamic-jihad,"ON THE EVENING of October 17th a blast struck al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City. Thousands of civilians had been sheltering there, alongside the sick. Palestinian officials say that hundreds died. Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, and several Arab countries blamed Israel. Israel’s army, citing drone footage as evidence, said that the explosion was caused by a malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), another militant group. PIJ, which operates in the West Bank and Gaza, denied the allegation. On October 18th, on a visit to Israel, President Joe Biden also blamed “the other team”, backing up Israel’s account. What is PIJ and what threat does it pose in this conflict? Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas The group was founded by Fathi Shaqaqi, a Palestinian doctor, and Abd al-Aziz Awda, a Muslim preacher born in Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. The pair were students in Egypt in the 1970s, where they were members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the world’s oldest Islamist group. Mr Awda and Shaqaqi advocated violent resistance against the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. Inspired by the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, they hoped to establish an Islamic state on the territory of the British mandate of Palestine, part of which became the state of Israel after 1948. They thought the Muslim Brotherhood was insufficiently committed to the cause, and began recruiting for their own militant alternative. After returning to Gaza in 1981 they spent several years building support. The group claimed responsibility for several attacks on Israeli soldiers in Gaza in the early 1980s, at least half a decade before Hamas carried out its first attack. Throughout the 1980s PIJ was a loose network of military cells, with only a few hundred members in total. In 1988 Israeli authorities deported Dr Shaqaqi to Lebanon, where he was later joined by other PIJ deportees. While in exile these fighters formed ties with Iran and Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militia in Lebanon. PIJ members began participating in Hizbullah’s training camps. The group founded the al-Quds Brigades, a more structured military operation than it had had before. Seeking to undermine peace talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, it carried out a series of suicide attacks in Israel. The most serious, in 1995, killed 21 Israeli soldiers and one civilian. Despite their ideological similarities, PIJ has remained at arm’s length from Hamas. During the first Intifada, or “shaking off”, an uprising against Israeli rule that ended in 1993, the two groups collaborated on several operations but never formally joined forces. Hamas won an election in Gaza in 2006 and, after failing to strike a power-sharing deal with Fatah, its rival, fought a brief war for sole control of the strip in 2007. PIJ limits itself to armed conflict. It has never participated in elections and, unlike Hamas, has provided little support to Gazans. PIJ’s influence declined in the 1990s, after Israel jailed many of its fighters in the West Bank. But many were released around 2000 and PIJ’s military capacities have since grown, assisted by arms supplies from Iran. In 2014, PIJ fired more than 100 rockets from Gaza at Israel. It is the second-largest of around a dozen armed groups in Gaza, after Hamas. Its presence in the West Bank has grown recently, particularly in Jenin, a city in the north. In 2022 several brigades linked to PIJ carried out a series of shootings on Israeli military checkpoints. PIJ has played a large role in the violence that began when Hamas invaded Israel on October 7th this year. PIJ fighters are thought to have joined the attack, in which more than 1,300 people died. The group later claimed to be holding 30 Israeli hostages in Gaza; Hamas is thought to be holding around 200. PIJ has since claimed responsibility for several rocket and mortar attacks on Israel. Israel is preparing for a ground invasion to “destroy Hamas”. PIJ will be in its sights, too. ■"
https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/10/28/the-israelis-and-palestinians-are-still-haunted-by-their-history,"Enemies and Neighbours: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017. By Ian Black.Atlantic Monthly Press; 608 pages; $30. Allen Lane; £25. IN THE roster of new states established in the past century, the creation of Israel has been extraordinary. It is one of the Middle East’s rare functioning democracies, with an intense public debate and a robust court system. It has absorbed destitute Jews from around the world and built a flourishing high-tech industry. All this in the face of wars and the intractable conflict with the Palestinians in its midst. When, exactly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict began is hard to say. Devout Jews have long lived in Palestine, and the first Zionists arrived in the late 19th century. But many historians point to November 2nd 1917 as the starting point. On that day the British government vowed to use its “best endeavours” to create a “national home” for the Jewish people in Palestine, which it would soon take from the Ottomans. That vague yet fateful promise, contained in a letter from Arthur Balfour, Britain’s foreign secretary, to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, ran to just 67 words. But the Balfour declaration, as it became known, “combined considerations of imperial planning, wartime propaganda, biblical resonances and a colonial mindset, as well as evident sympathy for the Zionist idea,” writes Ian Black in “Enemies and Neighbours”, his wonderful new history of Palestine and Israel from 1917 to 2017. If Israelis see the Balfour declaration as leading to the birth of Israel some 30 turbulent years later, Palestinians regard it as a great betrayal. Balfour wrote that nothing should be done to prejudice the “civil and religious rights” of Palestine’s “existing non-Jewish communities”, which then represented about 90% of the population. But he did not mention the Arabs by name, nor did he consult them. Their outrage has hardly diminished with time. The declaration “is the root cause of our destitution, dispossession and the ongoing occupation,” the Palestinian mission to Britain told a parliamentary committee in April. Mark Regev, the current Israeli ambassador to Britain, recently pointed to the Palestinians’ rejection of partition, in 1937 and again in 1947, as proof that “their statelessness was self-inflicted”. He contends that the Palestinians “chose intransigence over independence in 1967, 2000, 2008 and 2014”. So entrenched have the views of each side become that, as Mr Black puts it, “history is an extension of the battleground on which Israelis and Palestinians still fight.” The former Middle East editor for the Guardian, a British newspaper, Mr Black, for his part, plays it pretty straight, offering a well-rounded tour of the past century. The book excels when describing the moral price the Jews have paid to form, protect and expand their new country. The fighting that erupted after the creation of Israel in 1947 caused 700,000 Arabs to flee or be driven from their homes. Most were not allowed to return. The Palestinians took to calling this the Nakba, or catastrophe. The stunning victory in the war of 1967, in which Israel launched a pre-emptive attack to prevent encirclement by advancing Arab armies, was bittersweet. It helped secure the permanence of Israel and the unification of Jerusalem under Israeli rule. But by taking control of the biblical heartland and a large population of Palestinians living on it, it also established a permanent occupation that erodes Israeli democracy. The patchwork of authorities in the occupied lands (part autonomous under Palestinian rule and part frontier for Jewish settlers), as well as the security barrier that keeps Palestinians in the West Bank out of Israel, invites comparisons to apartheid. Even before the two Palestinian uprisings, of 1987 and 2000, Israeli military rule was hardly gentle. By the mid-1980s, Mr Black writes, about 250,000 Palestinians, or 10% of the population of the occupied territories, had experienced detention or interrogation. Some Israelis had qualms. “In order to enforce order in the kasbah we must be brutally violent against people who are innocent of any crime…and this weakens me and strengthens them,” one Israeli soldier stationed in Nablus told the author during the first intifada. Even the perpetrators of the most heinous attacks seek legitimacy in history. Take the abduction and murder of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. The Palestinian planners called it Operation Ikrit and Biram, after two villages in Galilee that were taken by Israel in 1948. The attack was carried out by a group called Black September, a reference to the period in 1970 when Jordan drove thousands of guerrillas from the Palestine Liberation Organisation out of the country. The Jordanians were troubled by the Palestinians’ violent ambition, as demonstrated by their attack on the American embassy in Amman in 1968—on the 51st anniversary of the Balfour declaration. Mr Black sprinkles his book with fascinating nuggets. David Ben-Gurion, then an MP, proposed tearing down the 16th-century Ottoman walls surrounding the Old City of Jerusalem after Israel’s victory in 1967. (Wiser heads prevailed.) Ariel Sharon, then a general, recounted how in the 1970s the army infiltrated its own phoney terrorists into Gaza, then chased them with helicopters and search parties until real terrorists made contact with them. But the book may leave some readers wanting more—about European diplomacy during the first world war; or about the Arab families who sold their land to Zionists. Plenty of other books fill the gaps. For its clarity and balance, though, Mr Black’s work stands tall in a field that is likely to continue growing. As he notes, by 2017 “the prospect of an equitable two-state solution being agreed voluntarily by both sides was extremely dim.” Mr Netanyahu’s government, perhaps the most right-wing in Israel’s history, seems uninterested in real Palestinian statehood. The Palestinians, long divided, are unable to make tough decisions. As Israel celebrates the centenary of the Balfour declaration, Palestinians plan to mark it with protests—as they have done every year since 1918. Correction (October 27th 2017): Following a request from the author, we have changed the name of the MP that proposed tearing down the Ottoman walls from Shimon Peres to David Ben-Gurion."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2007/11/22/mr-palestine,"Getty images  GEORGE BUSH is not likely to be remembered by history as the saviour of the Middle East. He botched Iraq, dropped his democratic “freedom agenda” when the Arabs started voting for the wrong people, and has spent most of his two terms more or less ignoring Palestine. On this last front, however, he now has an opportunity for redemption.  If all goes to plan, Mr Bush will preside on November 27th over a peace meeting in Annapolis, Maryland. Expectations of this one-day event are at rock bottom. Nobody foresees much more than some bland speechifying and a photo-opportunity. And yet, if he is bold, Mr Bush has it in his power to turn Annapolis into a significant step towards peace. All he has to do is pluck up the courage to make the right speech.  That may sound like a wild claim to make of an event already shrouded in defeatism. This is a party nobody is thrilled to have been asked to. Ehud Olmert is going because an Israeli prime minister cannot leave an invitation from the White House to curl in the in-tray. Mahmoud Abbas is going because after losing the Gaza Strip to Hamas he must show that he is still president of Palestine, if only in the eyes of the great powers. Not even the hosts seem excited. Condoleezza Rice, America's secretary of state, is a genuine if late convert to the idea that America can budge things in Palestine. But the rest of the administration appears to see Annapolis as a way to roll out the customary pieties on Palestine and so make it easier for America to line up its Arab friends against Iran.  Worse still, these modest ambitions have shrivelled as the day has neared (see article). Plan A was for Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas to talk to one another before Annapolis and make a joint declaration when they arrived. To give the Palestinians what Ms Rice calls a “political horizon” (ie, hope) this declaration was supposed to go beyond Mr Bush's oft-repeated but ephemeral “vision” of an independent Palestine and fill in the vital missing detail on borders, refugees and Jerusalem. But although the two sides have indeed talked in recent weeks they have not bridged their longstanding differences.  That is no surprise. With Hamas snapping at his heels, it would take immense courage for the timorous Mr Abbas to modify the Palestinians' mantra: a state on the 1967 borders, a capital in Jerusalem and the “right” of the refugees of 60 years ago to return to what is now Israel. And although Mr Olmert is at least the prime minister of a functioning state, he governs in coalition with men who hate the very idea of an independent Palestine and have worked sedulously to tie his hands. Polls show that many Israelis long to be rid of the Palestinian territories. But even they wonder how they can trust Mr Abbas's ramshackle Palestinian Authority to police a state when it has already lost Gaza to the rocket-firing rejectionists of Hamas and might well lose the West Bank too.  In the absence of a pre-Annapolis meeting of minds, America has therefore moved to Plan B. There may still be a joint declaration, but it will be vague. It will pay homage to the principle of two states and recite the relevant, long-ago United Nations resolutions, which both sides know by heart but interpret differently. The two sides may then promise to sit down together the day after Annapolis to talk about borders, refugees and Jerusalem, with the hope of reaching agreement within a year. In the meantime, Tony Blair, in his new guise as the UN's midwife for Palestine, will set out his plans to strengthen the economy and institutions of the West Bank in preparation for the independence that will come, some day. Are such modest aims worth going to Annapolis for? Just about. If Mr Bush gets the Saudis and Syrians as well as the Egyptians and Jordanians to show support in Maryland, this may boost and embolden Mr Abbas, at least for a while. If Annapolis leads to economic help and makes Israel free up movement on the West Bank, the life of many Palestinians will improve. If talks about borders, refugees and Jerusalem really do start right away, this will be a change: Israel previously cited the “road map” of 2003 as a reason to pickle final-status negotiations in formaldehyde until the PA uprooted the Palestinian militias. And if Israel honours its own obligation to freeze settlement in the territories, this may persuade some of the Palestinians who have good reason to doubt it that there will still be room one day for a state of their own.  Plan B, in short, is probably better than nothing. But if he dares, Mr Bush has it within his power to make Annapolis so much more. He cannot bring a free Palestine into being at a stroke, or even within the final year of his own presidency. The Israelis are right to say that the divided Palestinians are in no shape right now to govern a state: at some point Hamas has first to be bullied, bribed or cajoled into accepting Israel's permanence and joining the peace camp. But Annapolis does offer Mr Bush the perfect chance to make a speech that could set the Palestinians fair on the path to statehood, and leave America's next president in a far better position to finish the job.  In this speech Mr Bush needs to set out forthrightly America's own plan for dividing Palestine. That would mark an historic change. In the past—in Madrid in 1991, for example, and at Camp David in 2000—the Americans asked the Israelis and Palestinians to thrash out their differences on their own. But they can't. The gap is too wide, and even when their respective leaders want to narrow it neither dares move towards the other for fear of the uproar from the ideological bitter-enders at home. The existence of an American blueprint that commanded international support would, however, immediately transform the political dynamic of both societies, fortifying the moderates and pushing the hardliners to the margins.  Although it would be too much to expect Mr Bush to unfurl a map at Annapolis, he could come quite close. For a start, he should make it clear that when America talks of a two-state solution, it has in mind a border based on the pre-1967 line. Three years ago Mr Bush said in a public letter to Ariel Sharon that it would be unrealistic to expect Israel to evacuate all the dense settlement blocks it has planted in the West Bank. Fine. But since most settlers live close to the old border, he can now tell Israel that it cannot keep more than a few percentage points—say 5% or so—of the West Bank, and that it must offer the Palestinians land from its own side in compensation. On refugees, Mr Bush should say, as Bill Clinton did, that their right to “return” should be exercised in the new Palestine and not in pre-1967 Israel: that is a bitter pill but it is the logic of a peace based on partition. And Israel too must accept a bitter potion: Jerusalem, the beating heart of both peoples, will have to be the capital of both.  If Mr Bush gives this speech, Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas will wax furious. They might agree with him in their hearts, but if only for domestic political consumption they will have to accuse the American president of setting an ambush, bullying the little guys, prejudging the final-status issues and riding roughshod over the views and rights of the people most directly affected. These fulminations can be safely ignored. Israel and the Palestinian territories alike are full of politicians who will tell you knowingly but off the record that only a deal along the lines described above stands the remotest chance of bringing permanent peace. It is high time the superpower and the rest of the world threw their weight behind such a plan. The photo-op at Annapolis may be just the place to do it. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/05/03/syria-is-erasing-the-palestinians-largest-refugee-camp,"WHEN the bombing finally stops, little will remain of Palestine’s capital-in-exile. Yarmouk, on the southern edge of Damascus, Syria’s capital, was once the Palestinians’ largest and liveliest refugee camp, sheltering displaced Iraqis and Syrians too. But two weeks of relentless bombing by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and his Russian backers has reduced it to rubble. Of the 350,000 people who once lived in Yarmouk, only a few hundred remain. Syria used to treat the Palestinians well. They were provided with health care and education and allowed to own homes. Many worked for the government. Mr Assad gave Palestinian security forces arms and training to police their camps. Khaled Meshal, the leader of Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement, had more access to the president than most of the cabinet. But when Mr Meshal sided with his Qatari financiers, who backed Syria’s Islamist rebels after the uprising in 2011, Mr Assad and his men fumed at the treachery. They blasted Hamas for using its tunnelling skills to dig escape routes for the rebels. Some of its members fought with more radical groups. In 2015 the jihadists of Islamic State (IS) took control of most of Yarmouk. Jabhat al-Nusra, an erstwhile al-Qaeda affiliate, grabbed the rest. When the regime was not fighting them, they battled each other. The latest combat is on a different level. More has been damaged in a fortnight, say residents, than in the previous four years. Al-Nusra’s fighters surrendered to the government on April 30th and boarded buses bound for Idlib, a rebel redoubt in the north. Its arsenal all but spent, IS is negotiating a similar deal, though it does not want to go to Idlib. Many Palestinians believe the regime wants to redevelop Yarmouk—for use by Syrians. In March the government unveiled the second stage of a plan to rebuild southern Damascus, including areas that run along the camp’s edge. Businessmen eye opportunities. Some suggest relocating the Palestinians to distant scrubland. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has remained neutral during Syria’s war and some Palestinian groups even fought with the regime on the camp’s frontlines. But there is little hope that things will return to the way they were. “We’ll increasingly face a climate in which we cannot continue to live,” says a refugee from Yarmouk, now in London."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/can-the-palestinian-authority-control-gaza-if-hamas-is-ousted,"AS ISRAELI TROOPS prepare to invade Gaza, one question keeps coming up: who should take control of it after they have rooted out Hamas—if, indeed, they are able to do so? Many, especially Israel’s allies, are looking to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which was thrown out of Gaza by Hamas almost two years after Israel withdrew its troops and dismantled its settlements there in 2005. But the PA seems to be in no position to take charge of the coastal enclave. In fact there are no guarantees that by the end of this war it will even be in control of Ramallah, the de facto capital city of the West Bank. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas Born out of the Oslo Accords of 1993, the PA was supposed to be the basis of a future Palestinian state. But as the prospects of that state’s establishment have receded, so has confidence in the PA, which is led by the 87-year-old Mahmoud Abbas (pictured) and is widely seen by Palestinians as corrupt and incompetent. Mr Abbas was elected to serve a four-year presidential term in 2005—and has been there ever since. “There is not really a whole lot left in the legitimacy tank of the PA,” says Salam Fayad, a former prime minister of the PA. “Unless they really change course very rapidly, the whole thing could fall.” Partly because it has been unable to protect Palestinian civilians on the West Bank from  attacks by Israeli settlers or halt the expansion of Israeli settlements, the PA has lost control of security in swathes of the West Bank to militant groups such as Kata’ib Jenin and the Lions’ Den in Nablus in recent years. The slaughter of 1,400 Israelis by Hamas on October 7th, Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Hamas in Gaza, and a sharp increase in attacks by settlers have all pushed it into an even more precarious position. In a poll in September, 53% of Palestinians said they thought an “armed struggle” against Israel was the best way to establish a state, compared with just 20% favouring negotiations. As the war in Gaza goes on, along with the flow of pictures coming out of the enclave that show civilians killed by Israel’s bombing, Hamas’s popularity appears to be increasing, while the PA’s seems to be plummeting. When news broke of an explosion at Gaza’s Ahli Arab hospital, furious crowds thronged into the streets of the West Bank. Their anger was not, however, directed at Israel, which most Palestinians believe bombed the hospital. (A more likely explanation for the blast, according to independent analysts and Western intelligence agencies, is that it was caused by a misfired rocket launched from Gaza by Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group.) Instead anger was directed at the PA. Hundreds marched on Mr Abbas’s presidential compound in Ramallah. In an echo of the protests that rocked Arab countries and toppled governments in 2011, many chanted: “The people want the fall of the president.” Fatah, the Palestinian faction led by Mr Abbas that dominates the PA, was already riven by infighting over who would succeed him. Now it is being further torn apart over its stance on Hamas. Those close to the leader believe Fatah—and the PA, with which it has become synonymous—can muddle through to see the crushing of its Islamist rival, which could perhaps give it a chance to take back control of Gaza. However, many among the party’s rank and file think differently. “A collapse [of Hamas] in Gaza will lead to a collapse in Fatah,” says a Fatah official in Ramallah, as he agonised over the safety of his relatives in Gaza. Even those who have little love for Hamas and its Islamist fervour are dismayed by the prospect of its being wiped out by Israel. They are urging Mr Abbas to set aside factionalism and to rally the secular Fatah movement behind Hamas in a unity government. “Both sides need each other,” says Raed al-Debiy, a Fatah official in Nablus, the West Bank’s biggest city. “Hamas needs the international legitimacy of Fatah, and Fatah and the PA need the popularity of Hamas.” The PA’s legitimacy crisis is being intensified by a financial one. Although the PA has not been able to evolve into an independent Palestinian state, many Palestinians accept it simply as a source of salaries and public-sector work. Yet it seems it may not be able to provide even these. In the next few weeks the PA is scheduled to pay public-sector salaries, including the wages of 34,000 members of the Palestinian Security Forces. But it can afford to pay less than 50% of this month’s wage bill, according to one senior PA official, who added that, even before the current war in Gaza, Israel was withholding customs revenues which it is obliged to hand over. This cash crunch is likely to become more acute as a result of the war because Israel has closed its borders to the thousands of West Bank Palestinians who usually work in Israel and pay income taxes to the PA. Members of PA’s security forces are already accused by friends and family of being proxies  for Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. In many cases, the only thing that keeps them from leaving their posts is their monthly pay-cheque. The PA has weathered previous financial storms and paid salaries late, or been unable to pay them in full, in the past. But the latest projected pay cut is far larger. If it goes ahead, tens of thousands of young men in the PA’s police and national security forces may not show up to work. Some would be ripe recruits for other armed groups in the West Bank including Hamas and Islamist Jihad, the group that may have been responsible for the hospital blast in Gaza. In any case, it is hard to see how unpopular and unpaid security forces will stand their ground if Palestinians try to sack the presidential palace. “The Palestinian public is reaching a boiling point and an explosion against the authority,” says Amjad Bashqar, a Hamas official in Nablus. “The only thing delaying it is our focus on the resistance [against Israel]”. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/13/only-negotiations-can-bring-lasting-peace-to-israel-and-palestine,"IT WAS A confrontation waiting to happen, in a conflict the world would rather ignore. Israelis and Palestinians have once again goaded each other to the brink of war in the Holy Land. Hundreds of rockets, fired by Palestinian militants, have been aimed at Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and southern Israel. Gaza, the Palestinian territory run by Hamas, a violent Islamist movement, has been hit even harder by Israeli air strikes. Arabs and Jews have clashed in the streets of Israeli cities. Dozens of people, most of them Palestinian, have been killed. The worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in years has Jerusalem at its heart, as so often (see Middle East & Africa section). In April, at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israel’s police chief fenced off the plaza around the Damascus Gate, one of the entrances to Jerusalem’s old walled city and a gathering spot for Palestinians. The move, made for “security reasons”, led to clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police. Hundreds were injured. Then the rockets started flying. The violence, as ever, is counterproductive. Turning Israeli cities “into hell”, as Hamas threatens, will not help the Palestinians who suffer grievously in Gaza—just the opposite, in fact. Every rocket that Hamas fires makes it easier for Israel to claim that it has “no partner for peace” and to intensify its siege of Gaza. But Israel, too, must reconsider its strategy. Its leaders view the broader conflict as something to be managed, not solved. Yet its unjust treatment of the Palestinians stores up trouble. Today’s crisis was predictable—even if the spark that ignited it was not. Jerusalem epitomises the problem. Israel claims the city as its “eternal and undivided capital”. But its inhabitants are irrevocably split. The eastern part of the city, although captured by Israel in 1967, remains largely Palestinian. The Oslo accords of 1993 left the city’s status to be settled in a permanent peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. But Israel has built a wall separating Jerusalem from the Palestinian hinterland. It seeks to strengthen its claim to the whole city by ringing it with new Jewish homes and squeezing Palestinians out. Though they make up 38% of Jerusalem’s population, most local Palestinians are not citizens but mere “residents”, granted access to health care and social security, but not the same rights as Jews. This disparity in the law is at the heart of a case before Israel’s Supreme Court that is making the atmosphere more febrile. The court is reviewing a judgment to evict Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem. Their homes sit on land that was owned by Jews before Jordan occupied the eastern part of Jerusalem in 1948. Israeli law allows the heirs of the original owners to reclaim property in East Jerusalem. Yet Palestinians cannot claim their former homes in West Jerusalem (or anywhere else in Israel). No wonder Palestinian residents of the city are always ready to protest. The injustices elsewhere are worse. Palestinians in the wider West Bank, like those in Jerusalem, have watched Israel confiscate land and build settlements on occupied territory, which is illegal under international law. They must also deal with Israeli checkpoints and an onerous permit regime. In Gaza more than 2m Palestinians have been cut off from the world by Israeli and Egyptian blockades since 2007, when Hamas grabbed control. The territory struggles to keep the lights on; the tap water is filthy. Despair at such conditions led to violence in 2018 and 2019, and is feeding the current spasm. Yet Israeli politicians ignore the conflict. The Palestinian issue did not feature in any of the four elections Israel has recently held. Most Israelis are comfortable with the “anti-solutionism” of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who shows little interest in pursuing a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. His domestic rivals are edging closer to a deal that would push him out of power. But, before the recent violence, they said little about how they would handle the conflict. Palestinian leaders have made it easy for Israel to give up on peace. Hamas is more interested in firing rockets than improving the lives of Gazans. Its rival, Fatah, has not done much better in the West Bank. The party’s leader, Mahmoud Abbas, is in the 17th year of a four-year term as Palestine’s president. He seems concerned mainly with preserving his own power. On April 29th, blaming Israel for restricting voting in East Jerusalem, he indefinitely postponed elections that Fatah was likely to lose. With little hope of a better future, a good number of young Palestinians favour confronting Israel. That makes repeated fits of deadly violence inevitable. Only negotiations will bring lasting peace. Western and regional powers should press for them to resume; Israeli and Palestinian leaders should come to the table. Solving the conflict will be even harder than managing it. But talking is the one permanent way out. ■ A version of this article was published online on May 12th, 2021"
https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/05/a-new-book-revisits-a-bus-crash-that-killed-palestinian-children,"It began, as many accidents do, mundanely. A bus was ferrying a group of five- and six-year-old Palestinian children on a school trip. But there was heavy rain, and the bus collided with a truck on a road in the West Bank near Jerusalem. The bus went up in flames, killing eight Palestinian children and one of their teachers. In “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama” Nathan Thrall, an American author who lives in Jerusalem, examines the events leading up to the accident in 2012 and the heart-rending aftermath. Abed Salama is the father of one of the children involved. The book, which began as an article in the New York Review of Books published two years ago, is about the individuals affected by the accident. But, like a lot of writing about Israelis and Palestinians, the story is also about the history of two peoples living next to each other. It tries to answer what contributed to the horrors of that rainy day. In his book Mr Thrall captures both the universality and the specificity of the experiences of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. He recounts details any parent will recognise: the anxious chasing of the school’s secretary to pay for a trip; the last-minute dash to buy chocolate milk and crisps; the children staggering under backpacks “too large for their small bodies” as they clamber excitedly onto the coach. He also evokes details that will make parents’ stomachs churn: the urgency of the hunt for your child in a hospital, racing from one room to another; the flare of hope when you are told that your son was probably not on the bus that crashed (only to later learn the truth); the mother turning over in her mind the fact that she had almost refused to allow her son to go on the trip because the weather was so bad. Accidents happen everywhere, every day. But Mr Thrall’s contention is that the horror was made worse because of the ways in which Palestinians’ lives are so strongly shaped and controlled by Israel and that the accident’s causes can be traced to the occupation. He makes this case convincingly. As he weaves in history, Mr Thrall’s decade as director of the Arab-Israeli Project at the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, is evident. He describes the colours of the different ID cards held by Palestinians and how they define people and constrain their movement. He introduces the architect of the wall that separates the occupied West Bank from Israel proper and traces its design and impact. The depth of Mr Thrall’s knowledge adds weight to his judgments, though there are parts that read a bit too much like a think-tank report. Understanding the status of the West Bank and reckoning with what that actually means for Palestinians living there feels pertinent, given the desire of some members of Binyamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition to annex the area. Mr Thrall harnesses a now mostly forgotten accident and connects it to this recent history. For Palestinians living in the West Bank the wall limited their access to services, such as ambulances and police. Those areas deteriorated as infrastructure collapsed and drugs spread. Schools were awful. Parents who could afford it sent their children to private schools, which were largely unregulated. It was one of these schools that hired an illegally registered bus, which travelled along a congested, neglected route known as “the death road” before it crashed. “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama” is hard to characterise: it is part history, journalism, diatribe and lament. But the book builds a relentless case that this crash and the ensuing trauma must be remembered. It was all so predictable—and could easily happen again. ■ Correction (November 30th): A previous version of this article stated that eight Palestinian children were killed in the bus crash. It was six. Apologies. For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/05/26/the-leader-of-hamas-in-gaza-is-the-most-influential-man-in-palestine,"YAHYA SINWAR, 56, has spent his entire adult life in prisons: the concrete Israeli sort and the open-air prison that is Gaza. Yet Mr Sinwar is now, arguably, the most influential man in the Palestinian territories. On May 16th, two days after Israeli soldiers killed about 60 Palestinian protesters at the border fence, Gazans huddled around televisions to learn if the violence would push their scarred enclave into another war. They were not listening to Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, or even Ismail Haniyeh, the nominal leader of Hamas, the jihadist group that runs Gaza. They were watching Mr Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza, who may one day represent all Palestinians. He was under pressure from militants to avenge the dead. But Mr Sinwar announced on Al Jazeera that Hamas would pursue “peaceful, popular resistance”. (Less publicly, the group discouraged people from returning to the border fence.) It was an unexpected declaration by Hamas, which many countries consider a terrorist organisation. That it was delivered by Mr Sinwar made it all the more striking. Born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza, Mr Sinwar became an early member of Hamas and helped to create its secret police. The force was charged with identifying and killing Palestinians who collaborated with Israel. Mr Sinwar carried out some of the killings himself. In 1988 an Israeli court sentenced him to four life terms in prison. There he would remain for more than two decades. The turning-point came when Israel negotiated a prisoner swap to free Gilad Shalit, a soldier captured and held by Hamas. The Israelis used Mr Sinwar as an interlocutor. He was allowed to talk to Hamas’s leaders, who wanted more than 1,000 of their own released in exchange for Mr Shalit. Israel vetoed a few of the names on their list. Mr Sinwar was not among them; in 2011 he walked free. Some Israelis came to regret that choice as they watched him become a commander in the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. Founded in the 1980s, Hamas has always been fractious, split between the rough men of Qassam and the more pragmatic politburo. The schisms deepened after Hamas’s third war with Israel, in 2014, which left around 2,300 Palestinians (and 70 Israelis) dead. Mr Sinwar’s background, his long years in Israeli jails and his reticent demeanour all gave him clout with the militant cadres. But Israeli analysts thought he would struggle to play politics. They were wrong. When Mr Sinwar was selected to run Gaza by the politburo last year, both Israelis and Palestinians wondered—and feared—what kind of leader he would be. Gadi Eizenkot, the Israeli army chief, said his appointment erased the distinction between the political and military wings of Hamas. Gazans feared that a man who had spent so long in prison would be erratic and aggressive. Those who know him best paint a more complex picture. One of his Israeli interrogators recalls him as “extremely hardline and at the same time ruthlessly pragmatic”. The same assessment, almost word for word, comes from Muhammad Dahlan, a former Palestinian security chief exiled to the United Arab Emirates. They grew up together in Khan Younis, playing football in its dusty streets. Now they have a quiet partnership. Even though Mr Dahlan hails from Fatah, a nationalist party that is Hamas’s bitter rival, he has steered Emirati money to Gaza and helps Hamas negotiate with Egypt, which controls the strip’s southern border. Mr Sinwar has marginalised the diaspora leaders who once ran Hamas from comfortable homes in Beirut, Istanbul and the Gulf. He has also silenced hardline voices in Gaza—for now. Hamas spent years digging a network of underground tunnels as a way to sneak fighters across the border and bring mayhem to Israeli towns. But since 2016 it has watched the Israeli army identify and destroy them, with the help of new, classified technology. Muhammad Deif, the commander of the Qassam Brigades, wanted to use the tunnels before they were all closed. Mr Sinwar overruled him. None of this reflects a fundamental change. Rather, Hamas’s embrace of more peaceful action is tactical. Even Gaza’sfieriest militants admit that their meagrearsenal poses no serious threat to Israel. “We don’t have an army,” says Khaled al-Batsh of Islamic Jihad, an extremist group. Hamas pragmatists accept that a fourth war would be ruinous for Gaza, which is already suffering from decrepit infrastructure and awful services. “The most dangerous thing is that youth have started to lose hope [of] a dignified life in Gaza,” Mr Sinwar said in a meeting with foreign journalists this month, his first. “He is deeply ambitious,” says his interrogator. Mr Sinwar certainly looks more like a leader than the ailing Mr Abbas, 82, who recently spent time in hospital with pneumonia. Aides released a photo of him pacing the corridors in a bathrobe, a visual reminder of his doddering irrelevance. But if Mr Sinwar aspires to lead the Palestinians, he cannot do so at the helm of an armed group. The world will not recognise Hamas until it renounces violence. He has amassed more power than any Hamas leader in recent memory. Now he will have to decide just how pragmatic to be."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/01/17/an-israel-palestine-peace-conference-without-israel-or-palestine,"IT WAS, even by the dispiriting standards of Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, a futile concept: a peace conference without either of the warring parties. On January 15th diplomats from more than 70 countries flew to Paris for a summit against which Israeli officials had been inveighing for weeks. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, called it “rigged” and his defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, compared it to the Dreyfus trial. So the French government, keen to avoid the embarrassment of having Israel refuse to attend, did not invite either side. It was “like a wedding without a bride and groom,” quipped Naftali Bennett, Israel’s right-wing education minister. After a full day of debate, the diplomats issued a two-page declaration that urged both sides to “commit to the two-state solution…[and to] take urgent steps in order to reverse the current negative trends on the ground.” If that sounds familiar, it should. Parts of it were copied verbatim from the closing statement of the previous Paris peace conference, held in June. Reactions to it were apathetic. Israelis are more preoccupied with a criminal investigation of Mr Netanyahu, who has been questioned several times this month over alleged corruption (which he denies). Talk of an early election is in the air. Among Palestinians, politics is as stagnant as ever: the West Bank and Gaza Strip are run by rival parties, the nationalist Fatah movement and the Islamists of Hamas respectively; the unpopular Mahmoud Abbas is in the 13th year of what is meant to be four-year term as president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The real target audience of the organisers was in midtown Manhattan, not on the Mediterranean. No one knows exactly how Donald Trump will approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His views on the subject (as well as many others) are unclear and sometimes contradictory. The Israeli right is gleeful, however, about his pledge to move America’s embassy to Jerusalem, and by his choice for ambassador: David Friedman, who has said Israel should annex the West Bank, a move that would preclude the formation of a Palestinian state alongside the Jewish one. Moreover Mr Trump has said that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, will be the one to broker the peace between Israel and the Palestinians that has eluded all who have tried. He is hardly an honest broker: the Kushner family runs a foundation that has donated tens of thousands of dollars to West Bank settlements. All of this is anathema to the diplomats who gathered in Paris. They warned against “unilateral steps” in Jerusalem, a not-so-subtle dig at Mr Trump’s embassy plans, and reaffirmed last month’s UN Security Council vote to censure Israel over the settlements. The outgoing Obama administration declined to veto the measure, which passed 14-0. “There is a unity in the international community regarding the two-state solution,” said the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault. That unity is already showing a few cracks, though. Britain did not sign the Paris declaration, and expressed “particular reservations” about holding the conference so soon before the handover in America. Last month a spokesman for Theresa May, the British prime minister, criticised John Kerry, America’s secretary of state, for calling Israel’s government the “most right-wing” in history (though she says she still supports a two-state deal). Diplomats see an attempt to curry favour with Mr Trump. In truth, the Paris meeting felt less like a diplomatic summit than a farewell concert thrown by an ageing rock band. Mr Kerry, who from mid-2013 led nine months of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, has just a few days left in office. The host, President François Hollande of France, will step down this spring. And their catalogue, once edgy, now seems anachronistic. A plurality of Israeli Jews favour annexing the West Bank; two-thirds of Palestinians believe the two-state solution is no longer viable. Diplomats promised to meet again in Paris later this year. It may be difficult to justify the trip."
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/08/24/the-palestinian-cause-no-longer-binds-the-arab-world,"IN THE FIRST years after Israel’s founding, David Ben-Gurion promoted an “alliance of the periphery”. The father of modern Israel saw the Arab world as implacably hostile. So he sought ties with non-Arab states, chiefly Turkey and Iran, which both established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1950 (the first Muslim-majority countries to do so). The periphery looks rather different now. Israeli strategists point to Iran and Turkey as their chief regional adversaries: the first for its nuclear programmes and promotion of Shia militias, the second for harbouring Sunni Islamists, such as Hamas leaders. The Arabs no longer seem so implacable. Last year the UAE and Bahrain established diplomatic relations with Israel under the so-called “Abraham accords”; Sudan and Morocco followed suit. Fully half of Arabs now live in states that recognise Israel. This is not to say that the Palestinian cause has lost relevance. A glance at a television in May, when Israel fought an 11-day war with Hamas, showed otherwise: the bombardment of Gaza was an omnipresent fixture on the news. It is hard to speak with authority about public opinion in a region with such repressive regimes. But it is safe to say that most Arabs see Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians as a moral outrage—even if fewer think it can or should be wiped from the map. Most of Israel’s peace treaties in the Arab world are decidedly cold ones. Egypt reaped diplomatic and security benefits from its 1979 treaty, but Egyptians have few cultural or economic ties with their neighbour. The new Israeli envoy in Morocco struggled for months to find office space. Even so, the Palestinian cause, once a central issue to the Arab world, is now just one among many. No Arab state has fought Israel in almost 50 years, and no non-Palestinian group since 2006. In effect, the Arab-Israeli conflict, which once did so much to stitch together the region, no longer meaningfully exists. Even in the heady days of Arab nationalism, Arab unity was a stretch. The United Arab Republic (UAR), a merger between Egypt and Syria, lasted only three years. The rulers of Syria and Iraq, both adherents of Baathist ideology, were often at daggers drawn. And the potentates of the Gulf wanted no part in a nationalist wave they feared would crash over their own palaces. Egypt fought a ruinous proxy war with Saudi Arabia in North Yemen in the 1960s. The Arab-Israeli conflict was an exception. The “three nos”—no peace with Israel, no recognition and no negotiations—were shared policy for decades. Arab states banded together to fight Israel in 1948, 1967 and 1973. The defeat in 1967, which saw four Arab armies brought to heel by the Jewish upstart, played a big part in the demise of Arab nationalism. Nasser resigned, though he then reversed his decision. The defeat left him humbled: he was forced to sue for peace in Yemen. Mohammed Heikal, a Nasser confidante, quipped after the war that power in the Arab world had shifted from thawra (revolution) to tharwa (wealth). The shift was not quite straightforward: at first religion would supplant revolutionary nationalism. But today the region’s centre of gravity has moved to the rich Gulf states. Many did not become independent until the 1970s, when the Arab nationalist tide had already begun to ebb. Sheikh Zayed, founder of the UAE, spoke often about the Palestinians and called Israel an enemy. But he never needed to act on these words: the last Arab-Israeli war was fought less than two years after the UAE became a sovereign state in 1971. Even as a rhetorical device, the struggle with Israel has outlived its usefulness. “With all our love for the Palestinians, and our traditional support for them, there comes a point where we will no longer be able to sacrifice our interests for local struggles on the Palestinian side,” says a diplomat from a country that has normalised relations with Israel. One can quibble with this framing. The Gulf states had quiet security ties with Israel for years; they sacrificed little for the Palestinians. To call it a “local struggle”, though, underscores how little point it now has for Arab governments. In February an Emirati probe successfully entered orbit around Mars, making the UAE the first Arab state (and the fifth overall) to reach the red planet. The Emirates sought to frame this as an Arab accomplishment: for days billboards in Dubai offered “congratulations to the Arabs”. Assembled in America and launched into space by a Japanese rocket, the probe was hardly a wholly local endeavour. But the messaging was a sign of the extent to which the UAE sees itself as a regional leader. It may seem an unlikely candidate. It lacks Egypt’s size, Saudi Arabia’s religious clout, or the long history of Arab capitals such as Baghdad and Damascus. Citizens make up only 10% of its 10m population. Even its location, on the toe of the Arabian peninsula, is on the periphery, closer to Delhi than to Cairo. Many Arabs harbour chauvinism toward the khaleejis, desert-dwelling parvenus whose success stems from oil, luck and the hard work of foreigners. Yet many also aspire to live there. Dubai offers personal security and material comfort that are lacking in other Arab states. For decades that has been the main source of the UAE’s soft power. “We want to have a Middle East, and an Arab world, that is similar to the way in which we run our own country,” says one official. Emirati officials rattle off priorities that sound drawn from an IMF report: efficient, lean government; support for small business; investment in education. It can seem a caricature of bloodless, technocratic liberalism. But there is little altruism in the UAE’s regional policies. It invests in agriculture in Sudan to safeguard its own food security, and funds ports on the Red Sea to support its global logistics hub. It joined the war in Yemen only to secure allies in the south, then withdrew; it is now quietly building an air base off its coast. Most of all, the UAE has an aversion to mass politics. That is what makes Israel a logical partner, a state that offers cutting-edge surveillance tools, such as Pegasus software used to spy on journalists, activists and others. The Arab-Israeli conflict was an exercise in mass politics, instrumentalised by Arab leaders. The Abraham accords were its opposite: a way to shelve one of the few causes that resonates across the region but that Arabs have proved powerless to resolve.■ Full contents of this special reportThe Arab world: Identity crisisThe resistance axis: Pyrrhic victory for IranIslamism and its discontents: No solutionThe Abraham accords with Israel: A farewell to arms*Regional institutions: Talking headsSisi's Egypt: The new NasserismThe future: Staying at home"
https://www.economist.com/europe/2011/09/24/high-noon-over-palestine,"FOR blood-soaked decades the diplomatic game in the Arab-Israeli conflict has been summed up as “America plays, Europe pays”. American mediators from Henry Kissinger onwards have shuttled to and from Jerusalem, while the Europeans have become the biggest paymasters of the Palestinian Authority. Now fate has put the Europeans at the centre of the showdown over the Palestinian demand for full membership of the United Nations. The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, will square off with speeches to the General Assembly on the same day. Each carries a gun. Some in Israel threaten to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank and to cut off the Palestinians' customs revenues. The Palestinians can inflame the Arab street at a time of revolutionary turmoil, in which Israel stands perilously isolated after the breakdown in its diplomatic ties with Turkey and Egypt. Step in the Europeans, who are desperate to stop the fight, for many reasons. They think a negotiated deal is the best way to lasting peace. They fear a bust-up will radicalise their already-turbulent southern and eastern neighbourhoods. And they do not want to expose their own divisions. So far the Europeans are united only in silence, saying they will not declare themselves until they see what, precisely, the Palestinians are asking for. Does anybody care? Surprisingly, perhaps, yes. Although often mocked in Brussels as a mediocrity, Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign-policy chief, finds herself at the heart of Middle Eastern mediation. To some extent she has taken the role by default, as America has stepped back from peacemaking. Barack Obama has given up trying to force Mr Netanyahu to halt settlement-building in the West Bank. Tony Blair, the former British prime minister and envoy of the so-called Quartet (America, Russia, the UN and the EU) is discredited in the eyes of many Arabs, not just for his war in Iraq but also for supposedly favouring Israel. “He sounds like an Israeli diplomat sometimes,” says Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian negotiator. Lady Ashton, by contrast, has managed to win a degree of trust among Palestinians—her office in Brussels is decorated with a kite painted by children in Gaza—without losing the confidence of the Israelis. Mr Netanyahu has seen her three times in recent weeks. “We take her very seriously,” declares an Israeli official. “Her heart is in the right place,” says a Palestinian one. Both sides want Europe's support. It will not change the outcome in the UN: the Palestinians' quest for full membership is sure to be vetoed by America in the Security Council, but they can secure the votes in the General Assembly that they need to upgrade their status from a non-member “observer entity” to a non-member “observer state”—a rank comparable to that of the Vatican (and, in the past, of Switzerland and West Germany). But, as one Israeli official puts it, “the Europeans represent legitimacy.” European support for Palestinian membership could leave the Americans isolated in the Security Council. And without the backing of leading European democracies, an enhanced Palestinian status in the General Assembly would look empty. As ever, the Europeans would exert more moral influence if they acted in unison. Yet on the question of Palestine, especially, they struggle to speak with one voice. In February European members in the Security Council voted together—against a lone American veto—to denounce illegal Israeli settlements. But in 2009 they split three ways in the General Assembly over endorsing the contentious Goldstone report, which cited evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Israel (and Hamas) in the Gaza Strip during the 2008-09 war. Lady Ashton has tried to propose an alternative to full UN membership: the Vatican option, plus a Quartet statement setting out the terms and timetable for new talks on Palestinian statehood. This, she thinks, would give the Palestinians a tangible gain and maintain European unity. But the Palestinians have rejected her advice, in part because they doubt she can deliver all 27 EU votes in the General Assembly. On the face of it Palestinians have chosen principle over pragmatism. Why, they say, should they give up their right to UN membership to spare the EU's blushes? Yet the Europeans still see room for manoeuvre. It could take months for the Palestinians' membership request to reach a Security Council vote. And now minds in the Quartet are concentrated on trying to restart talks. The Palestinians have cocked the gun; the Europeans are trying to put it in a bulletproof box. Success would be a diplomatic triumph for Lady Ashton, but it will be hard. Neither Mr Netanyahu nor Mr Abbas seems ready or able to begin negotiations, let alone agree to lasting peace. Just say Yes So the Europeans in the Security Council could be called on to take sides. France may yet support Palestinian membership of the UN; the Germans will surely champion Israel; the British will probably abstain. From Charlemagne's perspective, not just as a resident of Brussels but as a former Jerusalem correspondent, it would be better for all three to support the Palestinian bid. This would keep alive the hope of a two-state solution. More than six decades after the UN voted to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, the idea is dying thanks to relentless Israeli settlement-building and the violent irredentism of Hamas and others. Yet as well as asserting Palestinians' right to statehood, the Europeans should say what they cannot have: an unfettered right of return for refugees to modern-day Israel. On these terms, France and Britain might be able to support the Palestinians, and the German government could abstain. Nobody expects Germany, with its Holocaust burden, to vote against Israel. But abstention would be a tacit Yes to a fair peace. Economist.com/blogs/charlemagne"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2003/03/13/an-alternative-mr-palestine,"Reuters  New leader, old grievance “HE IS not an Israeli agent, or anything like that,” said Amos Gilad, an Israeli general, of the Palestinians' first prime minister. Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, “opposes terrorism out of Palestinian interests, not Israeli interests,” he added. That he felt the need to point this out shows how much pressure the Palestinian Authority (PA) was under to appoint a new leader. The Israeli and American governments detest its current head, Yasser Arafat, and have said that the long-dead peace process cannot resume until his removal from power. They are reserving judgment as to whether Mr Abbas's appointment is a step in that direction; Hamas denounced it as a response to “American and Zionist pressures”.  In his newly-created role, Mr Abbas will run the day-to-day affairs of government, with responsibility for security and public order in the areas of the West Bank which the PA nominally controls but which are now mostly occupied by the Israeli army. Mr Arafat's autocratic grip will be weakened, but not removed. He will remain the authority's president, with the power to fire Mr Abbas. And as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), he will continue to reign supreme on matters to do with negotiations with Israel, foreign policy and “national security”. Mr Abbas will also be involved in negotiations with Israel, but as head of the PLO negotiation team, not as prime minister, and again answerable to his boss.  Palestinians hope that this division of labour will make the executive more accountable to their elected parliament. Israel and America are uninterested in new Palestinian elections; they want to see what actual powers the prime minister will have, particularly vis-à-vis the Palestinian militias that now rule in many of the disconnected Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps. So does Mr Abbas; he has yet to accept the nomination. A founder of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement, Mr Abbas has devoted his life to the Palestinian struggle, which gives him popular appeal. He is considered a moderate: as one of the main architects of the Oslo accords, he has long averred that Palestinians can only win independence by negotiation. In recent months he has become a vocal critic of the intifada, insisting that its “militarisation”, and particularly the suicide bombings, have tarnished the Palestinian cause and given Israel a pretext for oppression.  That said, Mr Abbas makes much the same demands as Mr Arafat does: a Palestinian state spanning all the territories Israel occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, and a “just” resolution for Palestinian refugees. Whether he will have any more success in realising these aims remains to be seen. "

IsraelThe modern state of Israel was established in May 1948 by Jewish leaders after the withdrawal of Britain from Palestine. The name also refers to a kingdom in ancient Palestine comprising the lands occupied by the Hebrew people. See map. Israel Defence ForcesIsrael’s army. Largely made up of reservists with a small core of professional soldiers. Led in 2023 by Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi. Read our profile of General Halevi. Jerusalem A city in Israel, holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims. Under the UN partition plan of 1947, Jerusalem was intended to be an international city, part of neither the future Jewish nor Arab states. It was divided by Israel and Jordan in the armistice of 1949. The eastern half was captured by Israel in the Six Day war of 1967, and annexed as part of its “eternal and indivisible capital”. Most countries keep their embassies in Tel Aviv, but the United States relocated its mission to Jerusalem in 2018. Jerusalem dayAn Israeli holiday marking Israel’s capture of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in the Six Day War in June 1967. Khan YounisA city and a refugee camp in southern Gaza in which many of the current leadership of Hamas grew up. KibbutzAgricultural communities in Israel often run as collective economies. Kibbutzim close to Gaza were targeted by Hamas on October 7th 2023. League of NationsA forerunner to the United Nations. In 1922 the League gave Britain the mandate to run Palestine as an international territory. Lebanon war, firstFour month conflict between Israel and Lebanon in 1982. Known in Israel as Operation Peace for Galilee. Israel invaded in order to dismantle Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation which had taken control of the south of Lebanon. The war killed thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians, along with hundreds of Israeli and Syrian soldiers. The PLO subsequently moved its headquarters to Tunisia. In 1985 most Israeli troops were withdrawn from Lebanon, except for a border “security zone”. Lebanon war, second Conflict between Israel and Lebanon between July and August 2006. Launched by Israel in an attempt to destroy Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militant group and political party which had created a “state within a state” in the south of the country. Israel imposed a naval blockade, bombed Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, and invaded the south. Six years earlier Israeli troops had withdrawn from the security zone established in 1985. Mahmoud AbbasThe ageing head of Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank. Mr Abbas was elected to serve a four-year presidential term in 2005 but has remained in post ever since. He is also head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and of Fatah. Nakba“Catastrophe” in Arabic. The mass displacement of Palestinians that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. Around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were pushed out of their homes. Occupied territoriesThe collective name for the occupied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Oslo accordsIn 1993 Israel and the Palestinians, represented by the Palestine Liberation Organisation, signed the first Oslo accord, which set out a five-year period of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under a new entity, the Palestinian Authority. The Oslo II accords, under which Israel handed over security responsibility to the Palestinian Authority in parts of the occupied territories, were signed in 1995 with the intention of a permanent treaty five years later. That did not happen. Palestine Liberation OrganisationA Palestinian organisation recognised by the Arab League as the “sole legitimate representative” of the Palestinian people. Represents Palestinians internationally, including at the UN. Palestinian AuthorityAn autonomous government for parts of Gaza and the West Bank founded in 1994. Intended to be the basis of a future Palestinian state. Its first leader was Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Expelled from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. Widely seen by Palestinians as corrupt and incompetent. Palestinian Islamic JihadA militant group with links to Iran which operates in the West Bank and Gaza with the aim of establishing an Islamic state. Unlike Hamas the group limits itself to armed conflict. It has never participated in elections and has provided little support to people in Gaza. Read our full explainer about the group. PalestiniansA population of around 14m people who trace their origins to British-ruled Palestine. Around 7m Palestinians live in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Another 7m are strewn across the Arab world and beyond. Nearly 6m are registered as refugees. Rafah crossingA border crossing between Gaza and Egypt’s Sinai peninsula. Used during the war of 2023 to import aid. RamallahA city in the West Bank and the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority. San Remo ConferenceA conference of European powers and Japan held in Italy in 1920 during which the Ottoman empire was carved up. Britain was given a mandate to rule Palestine, the international territory envisioned under the Sykes-Picot agreement. SettlersAround 700,000 Israelis living in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Their presence is considered illegal under international law. Violence between settlers and Palestinians is common. Sinai peninsulaTerritory briefly seized by Israel from Egypt during the Suez crisis in 1956 and again in the Six Day War in 1967. It was returned to Egypt in 1982 as part of a peace deal. See map. Six Day War Brief armed conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbours in June 1967. Israel tripled its territory, capturing the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai peninsula. Israel has since moved to build Jewish settlements on some of the land occupied during the war. Suez crisisIn October 1956 Israel invaded Egypt, capturing the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip. The conflict was planned in collusion with Britain and France in order to allow them to regain control of the Suez Canal which they had run until Egypt’s president, Gamal Abdul Nasser, nationalised it in July 1956. America was outraged and pushed Britain to abort the mission. In December 1956 the Israelis withdrew from Sinai and in March 1957 they withdrew from Gaza. Sykes-Picot Agreement During the first world war Sir Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, and François Georges-Picot, a French one, were appointed to secretly divvy up the lands of the Ottoman empire. The Arab provinces were to be split up among European powers. Given its significance in Christianity, Islam and Judaism, Palestine was envisioned as an international territory. Tel Aviv Israel’s largest city and financial capital. Of the 96 embassies in Israel, 91 are located in Tel Aviv (the other five, including the American embassy, are in Jerusalem). TransjordanAn Arab kingdom under Hashemite rule, created by Britain in 1921 after the San Remo Conference. Now Jordan. Tunnels First built for smuggling, tunnels under Gaza are used by Hamas fighters to attack Israel and to hide from Israeli fire. After the October 7th attacks the Israel Defence Forces unleashed air strikes to damage the tunnels. Two-state solutionA proposed peace plan to end the Isreli-Palestinian conflict that is widely supported internationally. A Palestinian state would be formed in Gaza and the West Bank; Israel would swap chunks of its territory for portions with large settlements in the West Bank. Jerusalem would be shared, with some sort of joint control over the old city. UNRWA The UN’s Relief and Works Agency, which looks after the welfare of 5.9m registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East. War of IndependenceIsrael’s name for the war of 1947-48. On May 14th 1948 Jewish leaders established the state of Israel. On May 15th a coalition of Arab neighbours invaded. At the end of the war Israel increased its territory to include land the UN had intended for an Arab state, as well as West Jerusalem. Transjordan held the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Egypt held the Gaza Strip. The war was followed by the mass displacement of Palestinian Arabs, known in Arabic as the Nakba. West Bank Israeli-occupied territory run in part by the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians view it as the core of their would-be state. Right-wing and religious Israelis regard it as their ancestral territory, with many biblical sites, and are pushing for Israel to annex it in part or entirely. Home to increasing numbers of Israeli settlers. Yom Kippur war In October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria launched an attack in Sinai and the Golan Heights. The war lasted three weeks and ended with a ceasefire secured by the UN. Zionism A movement founded by Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jew, with the aim of creating a Jewish homeland. In the 1920s the movement was dominated by socialists, who went on to establish the state of Israel on socialist principles. In more recent years religious Zionism, an offshoot, which regards Zionism as a fundamental component of Orthodox Judaism, has become a powerful force. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/20/why-israel-needs-a-palestinian-state,"THE victory of Israel over the Arab armies that encircled it in 1967 was so swift and absolute that, many Jews thought, the divine hand must have tipped the scales. Before the six-day war Israel had feared another Holocaust; thereafter it became an empire of sorts. Awestruck, the Jews took the holy sites of Jerusalem and the places of their biblical stories. But the land came with many Palestinians whom Israel could neither expel nor absorb. Was Providence smiling on Israel, or testing it? For the past 50 years, Israel has tried to have it both ways: taking the land by planting Jewish settlements on it; and keeping the Palestinians unenfranchised under military occupation, denied either their own state or political equality within Israel (see our special report in this issue). Palestinians have damaged their cause through decades of indiscriminate violence. Yet their dispossession is a reproach to Israel, which is by far the stronger party and claims to be a model democracy. Israel’s “temporary” occupation has endured for half a century. The peace process that created “interim” Palestinian autonomy, due to last just five years before a final deal, has dragged on for more than 20. A Palestinian state is long overdue. Rather than resist it, Israel should be the foremost champion of the future Palestine that will be its neighbour. This is not because the intractable conflict is the worst in the Middle East or, as many once thought, the central cause of regional instability: the carnage of the civil wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere disproves such notions. The reason Israel must let the Palestinian people go is to preserve its own democracy. Unexpectedly, there may be a new opportunity to make peace: Donald Trump wants to secure “the ultimate deal” and is due to visit the Holy Land on May 22nd, during his first foreign trip. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, appears as nervous as the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, seems upbeat. Mr Trump has, rightly, urged Israel to curb settlement-building. Israel wants him to keep his promise to move the American embassy to Jerusalem. He should hold off until he is ready to go really big: recognise Palestine at the same time and open a second embassy in Jerusalem to talk to it. The outlines of peace are well known. Palestinians would accept the Jewish state born from the war of 1947-48 (made up of about three-quarters of the British mandate of Palestine). In return, Israel would allow the creation of a Palestinian state in the remaining lands it occupied in 1967 (about one-quarter). Parcels could be swapped to take in the main settlements, and Jerusalem would have to be shared. Palestinian refugees would return mostly to their new state, not Israel. The fact that such a deal is familiar does not make it likely. Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas will probably string out the process—and try to ensure the other gets blamed for failure. Distracted by scandals, Mr Trump may lose interest; Mr Netanyahu may lose power (he faces several police investigations); and Mr Abbas may die (he is 82 and a smoker). The limbo of semi-war and semi-peace is, sadly, a tolerable option for both. Nevertheless, the creation of a Palestinian state is the second half of the world’s promise, still unredeemed, to split British-era Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. Since the six-day war, Israel has been willing to swap land for peace, notably when it returned Sinai to Egypt in 1982. But the conquests of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were different. They lie at the heart of Israelis’ and Palestinians’ rival histories, and add the intransigence of religion to a nationalist conflict. Early Zionist leaders accepted partition grudgingly; Arab ones tragically rejected it outright. In 1988 the Palestine Liberation Organisation accepted a state on part of the land, but Israeli leaders resisted the idea until 2000. Mr Netanyahu himself spoke of a (limited) Palestinian state only in 2009. Another reason for the failure to get two states is violence. Extremists on both sides set out to destroy the Oslo accords of 1993, the first step to a deal. The Palestinian uprising in 2000-05 was searing. Wars after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 and Gaza in 2005 made everything worse. As blood flowed, the vital ingredient of peace—trust—died. Most Israelis are in no rush to try offering land for peace again. Their security has improved, the economy is booming and Arab states are courting Israel for intelligence on terrorists and an alliance against Iran. The Palestinians are weak and divided, and might not be able to make a deal. Mr Abbas, though moderate, is unpopular; and he lost Gaza to his Islamist rivals, Hamas. What if Hamas also takes over the West Bank? All this makes for a dangerous complacency: that, although the conflict cannot be solved, it can be managed indefinitely. Yet the never-ending subjugation of Palestinians will erode Israel’s standing abroad and damage its democracy at home. Its politics are turning towards ethno-religious chauvinism, seeking to marginalise Arabs and Jewish leftists, including human-rights groups. The government objected even to a novel about a Jewish-Arab love affair. As Israel grows wealthier, the immiseration of Palestinians becomes more disturbing. Its predicament grows more acute as the number of Palestinians between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean catches up with that of Jews. Israel cannot hold on to all of the “Land of Israel”, keep its predominantly Jewish identity and remain a proper democracy. To save democracy, and prevent a slide to racism or even apartheid, it has to give up the occupied lands. Thus, if Mr Abbas’s Palestinian Authority (PA) is weak, then Israel needs to build it up, not undermine it. Without progress to a state, the PA cannot maintain security co-operation with Israel for ever; nor can it regain its credibility. Israel should let Palestinians move more freely and remove all barriers to their goods (a freer market would make Israel richer, too). It should let the PA expand beyond its ink-spots. Israel should voluntarily halt all settlements, at least beyond its security barrier. Israel is too strong for a Palestinian state to threaten its existence. In fact, such a state is vital to its future. Only when Palestine is born will Israel complete the victory of 1967."
https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/2005/05/12/3968522-hamas-gets-stronger-fatah-and-israel-get-scared-new-hamas-new-palestine,"AN EAGER crowd gathers in Beit Hanoun, at the north-east edge of the Gaza strip, to explain why it is so great to have Hamas running their town. Since winning 11 of the 13 council seats in an election in January, the Islamic Resistance Movement has cleaned up the streets, started free school buses and opened a women's centre. Projects for repaving, rebuilding and replanting areas destroyed by Israeli incursions are getting under way, and warnings that foreign donors would be wary of financing a Hamas council seem to have been baseless. Unlike before, council employees work full hours, official vehicles are used only for official business, and it is easy to get in to see the mayor.  Is there anything Islamic about it? “No,” smiles Walid Mohammed Ismain, a councillor. “We still have the picture of Yasser Arafat in the mayor's office.” Fatah, the late Palestinian leader's party and the ruling force in the Palestinian Authority (PA), is watching Hamas with growing alarm. The Islamists, who had never run in elections before this year, last week took a majority in 37 of 84 local councils. Fatah has claimed victory in up to 57, but in fact won only 30 outright. The rest are controlled mainly by “independent” councillors, some perhaps loyal to Fatah, but at least some of whom are disguised Hamas members, keeping a low profile to avoid being targeted by Israel. Hamas now has its eye not only on the third and biggest set of municipal elections, due in August, but more importantly, on the July vote for the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), which could give it a say in national policy.  Israel is also worried, for it sees Hamas as the chief architect of terror attacks (though pro-Fatah militias are equally active), and with an unclear position on whether Israel should exist (though it has shown signs of favouring a negotiated peace). Silvan Shalom, Israel's foreign minister, called for suspending the Gaza disengagement, set for mid-August, if Hamas wins control of the PLC. But other ministers slapped him down, one saying that such remarks strengthen the Islamists.  Many Gazans agree. “It's a free election campaign for them,” says Mohammed al-Masri, the Fatah ex-mayor of Beit Lahiya, where Hamas won a narrow majority last week. In fact, the local and national are quite different political spheres. Locally, Hamas campaigns as the party of social welfare and non-corruption, and its slogan that “Islam is the solution” or its support for armed resistance are secondary. Character or local standing often matter more than party colours.  The PLC election, however, will depend on how badly the PA, and by association Fatah, is doing. Reforms since Arafat's death have so far produced few visible effects besides the exit of a few of his cronies, and Israel is dragging its feet on concessions such as releasing prisoners, as it promised in February. Hamas has no chance of taking over the government. Most Palestinians, polls say, want a secular state. But they may give Hamas a big say in parliament if the PA has made no progress, or Israel does not dangle a few carrots.  Fatah itself has been scared into some sort of action. It adopted a fairer method of selecting candidates: internal nominations, followed by opinion polls to pick the most electable. But it is still making mistakes, says Mr al-Masri, such as failing to reach out to women as Hamas does. Some Fatah leaders argue that Hamas's appeal will wane because, by moderating its position and joining the political system, it will end up looking like its opponent. Yet Fatah policies in a fresher, cleaner package may be just what people want. "
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/27/why-are-so-many-of-the-victims-in-gaza-children,"To read more of The Economist’s data journalism visit our Graphic detail page. CHILDREN ARE a very high proportion of the victims of war in Gaza. According to the Palestinian health ministry, around 3,000 children were killed in the first 17 days of the war—roughly 40% of the total death toll. Although there are some concerns that number could be inflated—the health ministry is run by Hamas and President Joe Biden said that he has “no notion that Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed”—the ministry’s estimates have been broadly accurate in previous conflicts. In Ukraine, a conflict between two much bigger powers, children account for fewer than 550 of roughly 9,800 civilian fatalities over a much longer period. Gaza’s enormous child death toll reflects, among other things, its especially youthful demography. About half of the population of the Palestinian territories is younger than 20 years old, a much higher share than the average of other upper-middle income countries such as Iraq, Namibia and Thailand (see right-hand chart). The basis of a youthful society is a high fertility rate, the number of children a typical woman will have in her lifetime. The rate in the Palestinian territories, including both Gaza (total population 2m) and the West Bank (3m), was 3.4 in 2021, according to the UN Population Division. From 2017 to 2019 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) put it at 3.8. Detailed data that disaggregate Gaza and the West Bank are hard to come by. But, according to the PCBS, Gaza’s fertility was 3.9 during that period. These rates are far higher than those of neighbouring Israel, Jordan or Egypt and comparable to those of Ghana or Congo, both much poorer countries. A fertility rate this high is typically associated with short lifespans, poverty and low levels of female education. The Palestinian territories do not have those characteristics. Average income per person in the territories is $4,600 a year, higher than in Egypt and Jordan. (The figure for Gaza is thought to be considerably lower.) More girls than boys are enrolled in secondary education. The Palestinian territories are unusual in combining poor-country fertility with upper-middle-income social characteristics. Why? It seems likely that the long conflict with Israel and the influence of Hamas (which runs Gaza but not the West Bank) are partly responsible. Yasser Arafat, the former president of the Palestinian Authority, once said his people were conducting “a war of cradles”: population growth was a way to affirm Palestinian identity and perseverance. Hamas’s pro-natal rhetoric has been particularly vociferous. After taking control of Gaza in 2007 it sought to maintain the strip’s high fertility rate; which stood at 5.8 from 1999 to 2003, one of the highest anywhere. Fertility has fallen since, as it has almost everywhere. But Gazans born in the baby boom of 20 years are now having their own families. In 2015 Gaza had about two thirds the population of the West Bank, the historic centre of Palestine. At current rates, it will be near parity within 25 years, giving Gaza a bigger voice in the debate over any future Palestinian state. ■ Editor’s note (November 10th): This article has been updated since it was published."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2000/10/15/a-state-called-palestine,"Reuters  MOUNTAINS heave in childbirth and a mouse is born, wrote Horace. A phenomenal amount of heaving has gone into the small Israeli-Palestinian deal on territory that may or may not be delivered from the three-way summit that was due to start on October 15th at the Wye plantation in Maryland. Before the meeting, the Israelis were sounding pessimistic. But Binyamin Netanyahu wants a second term as Israel's prime minister, Yasser Arafat wants to add to the disjointed pieces of land under his control and Bill Clinton wants the puff of a diplomatic triumph. The interim deal, which should have been a routine part of a timetable already agreed on, will be important not so much for its contents as for its existence: without it, no further progress is possible. If Mr Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon, his new foreign minister and the most predatory of hawks, decide to sign, it could, as our Israel correspondent suggests, lead to a realignment of Israeli politics (see article). After that, the way will be eased to the next, hugely difficult, search for a permanent solution to the whole Israeli-Palestinian mess. The peace-process timetable lays down that this solution should be in place by May 4th 1999. That is now unrealistic. But a frustrated Mr Arafat has said that, if things are still stuck by then, he will unilaterally declare a Palestinian state. If he does, replies Mr Netanyahu, the agreements underlying the peace process will be null and void, and Israel free to do as it pleases. The threat, and counter-threat, spell disaster. But it is a disaster that could be avoided if bargaining took over from sabre-rattling. The confrontational approach—yes I will, no you won't—is unrewarding. The principle of independence is generally accepted. A majority of countries already recognise the Palestinian state that Mr Arafat proclaimed from exile in 1988, when he formally renounced the Palestinians' claim to Israel itself. Most of the rest of the world is ready to do so. Making independence official would strip away a lot of humbug and double-talk, give the Palestinian Authority proper standing under international law, and force Palestinians to accept responsibility for their own self-government. The real question is not whether Palestine should be a state but what sort of state it should be. This is what Mr Arafat and Mr Netanyahu should be arguing about in the all-important “permanent” negotiations. Israel's Labour opposition is already open to the idea of Palestinian independence—and even Mr Sharon himself has said that it is inevitable. If Mr Netanyahu wants to prove himself the middle-of-the-road statesman that most Israeli voters could support, he needs to dump his far-right partners, seek Labour help, which has been offered to see the current not-yet-agreed deal implemented, and set about bargaining for the limitations on statehood that Israeli security demands. Other countries, from Austria to Andorra, enjoy sovereignty with strings. Israel would insist, and would be right to insist, on the tightness of the strings restricting a militaristic Palestine. In return for statehood, Israel will want annexed chunks of land, buffer zones, redrawn borders. All that can be bargained for but, in the end, Israeli security will depend less on territorial safeguards than on removing the cause for violence. And that means allowing the Palestinians not only a state but one that is reasonably decent. It does not mean fobbing them off with vulnerable bits and bobs of territory that can be sliced, one from the other, at an Israeli whim. Creating bantustans is a rotten prescription for a lasting peace. The argument over withdrawal that accompanies the Wye summit shows how hard it is for Israelis to step back from any of the land that many believe to be theirs by religious right. Since it remains the precondition for true peace, the argument has to be continued. But better still if, from now on, it is held in the framework of how much land and independence a state called Palestine should reasonably and safely have. "
https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2010/03/14/this-map-is-not-the-territories,"A FEW days ago Andrew Sullivan published a rather distorted map that misrepresents the history of land transfers from Palestinian to Jewish control in the territory of Israel and Palestine. It's not clear who initially produced the map, but Mr Sullivan got it from Juan Cole, the Middle East expert, who should have known better. Jeffrey Goldberg strongly objected to the map, but he did a poor job of explaining why the map is so confused and tendentious. Mr Sullivan then responded to Mr Goldberg's objections in a fashion that, because those objections were not well explained, also missed the point. It's a big mess. Here's the map in question: Mr Goldberg argued that the problem with this map is that it represents the territory in 1946 under the name ""Palestine"", implying that there had been a Palestinian state which was then taken over by Israel. But that's not quite the point. The point is that the map fails to distinguish between land that is owned by Jews or Palestinians, and land that is controlled  by Jewish or Palestinian political entities. Take the vast triangular tract of land at the south of the map. That's the Negev desert. Apart from a few small oases, kibbutzes and towns, it's empty wasteland; it isn't owned by anyone. It represents almost half of the territory of Israel/Palestine. In 1946, the map represents it as ""Palestinian land"". That's silly. In 1949, it has somehow become ""Jewish land"". That's almost as silly, though Jewish irrigation projects did gradually, over a period of decades, turn an increasing (if still-small) portion of the desert into arable agricultural land claimed by Jewish owners. But the impression the map gives is that in 1947-8, Jews seized that land from Palestinian owners, which is absurd. What happened was that a piece of empty desert which had been under the control of the British Mandate (who got it after the Ottoman Empire fell apart) was awarded to the Jewish state. This is a question of political control, not land ownership. Here's an even more obvious case. See that rightward bulge at the map's top right? In 1946, it too is green, and by 1949, it too has turned white. That bulge is the Sea of Galilee. It seems fairly straightforward that representing this body of water as ""Palestinian land"" in 1946 and ""Jewish land"" in 1949 is rather absurd. Even within settled areas, like the coastal plain, the Galilee and the West Bank, it's impossible to tell from this map whether ""Jewish land"" refers to land owned by Jews or land under Israeli/Jewish political control. What about land that continues to be owned by its Palestinian owners while politically becoming part of Israel? Such land is not represented on this map. And so forth. The map needs to distinguish four categories of land: land owned by Jews under Israeli political control; land owned by Jews but under Palestinian political control; land owned by Palestinians but under Israeli political control; and land owned by Palestinians under Palestinian political control. On the 1946 map, furthermore, there would need to be a different means of representation entirely, since there was, at the time, no Jewish or Palestinian political control. This map blurs the distinctions incomprehensibly, and it does so in a way that tendentiously maximises the impression that Jews have seized Palestinian-owned land. Jews, and the Israeli state, have, in fact, seized great quantities of Palestinian land in the territory of Israel/Palestine over the past 60 years. Israelis and Americans must acknowledge this fact to make any progress towards peace, and an accurate accounting of such seizures would be very valuable. But this particular map only confuses and distorts the issue, and seems clearly designed for propaganda purposes."
https://www.economist.com/newsbook/2011/01/24/the-palestine-papers,"FOR almost 24 hours, Al Jazeera, the Arab world's most popular news channel, has lead its bulletins with reports of outlandish concessions made by Palestinian officials during negotiations with Israel since 1999. So grave were the allegations contained in some 1,600 documents and 50 maps leaked to the channel, claimed commentators Al Jazeera drafted into its studios, they would end the last kicks from the dying horse of the peace process, and unseat the Palestinian leadership. If anything the first batch of leaked papers appears to do the opposite. It shows the Palestinians defending their corner rather well, and largely upholding previous positions. On Jerusalem, Ahmed Qurie and Saeb Erekat, the two main Palestinian negotiators during the Annapolis process begun in 2007, stuck to the parameters established by then-president Bill Clinton a decade ago of an ethnic partition of the city: the Jewish bits would remain Jewish, and the Palestinian bits Palestinian. Both men withstood Israeli pressure to extend the formula to two large Jewish settlements, Maale Adumim and Har Homa, to the east and south of the city. On Jerusalem's Old City, the epicentre of the conflict, Palestinians also restated positions established under Yasser Arafat, the former Palestinian president. They insist that the only part of the Haram al-Sharif, the compound containing Islam's third holiest mosque and the site on which some Jews want to build a third temple, that they would consider ceding to Israel would be the Wailing Wall on which the temple stood. In indirect talks after Binyamin Netanyahu became Israel's prime minister, Mr Erekat went a bit further—in ""a private"" capacity—by advertising his readiness to consider ""creative"" alternatives, and implied his readiness to consider the supervision of an international committee, a much-floated idea. As for the rest of the Old City, the Palestinian team insisted on keeping all but the Jewish and some of the Armenian quarters. How Al Jazeera's spin will play out amongst the Palestinian public is unclear. Allies of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, predictably denounced the messenger, sidestepping his message, by attacking Al Jazeera's offices. A senior Palestinian official, Yasser Abd Rabbo, blasted the Emir of Qatar, the small Gulf state that owns Al Jazeera, of conducting a campaign against Mr Abbas in order to project his regional influence. Ramallah's rumour-mill blamed Mohammed Dahlan, a former security chief, against whom Mr Abbas recently launched an investigation on suspicion of plotting to overthrow him. Only last week, Mr Dahlan's aides threatened to release embarrassing documents if what he termed the ""witch-hunt"" by Mr Abbas persisted. On current evidence, the leaks are just as awkward for Israel. They contradict the official Israeli narrative that the Palestinians rejected generous Israeli offers, and portray Palestinians as initiating ideas, only to be stymied by Israeli stonewalling. They give credence to Palestinian claims that Mr Netanyahu made no counter-proposals. Had a more responsive Israeli prime minister been in charge, or had the Obama administration picked up from where his predecessors left off, rather than frittering away two years on an elusive settlement freeze, a two-state agreement might yet have looked imminent. To date only the usual suspects, led by Hamas, Fatah's Islamist rivals who rule Gaza, have accused Mr Abbas and his aides of selling out. Inside the West Bank, there have been no reported demonstrations or calls for Mr Abbas to go. Whether the calm continues, though, could depend on Al Jazeera's next instalments. The channel is broadcasting trailers for further revelations on Palestinian security coordination with Israel, Mr Abbas's position on the Gaza blockade and the fighting in Gaza in the winter of 2008-2009. Tonight's promised exposé is on refugees. Should they show Mr Abbas and his aides compromising the Palestinian claim to the right of return for refugees uprooted in 1948 and 1967, his authority—particularly in the teeming refugee camps of Lebanon and Gaza—might be more seriously tested. Despite Al Jazeera's best efforts, though, predictions of a Tunisia-style toppling appear premature."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/10/13/how-palestine-might-become-a-state,"FEW areas of international law are as fraught as the issue of what makes a state. And few questions of statehood have been as fraught as Palestine's. On October 13th the British parliament voted that Palestine should be officially regarded as a state alongside Israel (though the government is not bound by this decision). The British debate followed the announcement on October 3rd by Sweden's new government that it was ready to recognise Palestine as a state (though it seems to have backtracked from this since then). How does a place become a state? The Montevideo Convention on the rights and duties of states, signed by 20 countries in North and South America in 1933, sets four criteria for becoming a state: a permanent population, a government, defined borders and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. But these are little more than guidelines. Many places recognised as states do not comply. Libya has more than one government. Many states emerged after national movements declared independence and then sought recognition by other states and admission into the United Nations. Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), declared Palestine a state in 1988 in Algiers, and has subsequently secured recognition from over 130 states, or over two-thirds of the UN. But Palestine’s admission into the UN has been tortuously slow. In 1974 the PLO won recognition as a ""non-member observer entity"" at the UN, a category shared by OPEC, the Arab League and the African Development Bank, among others. In 2012 the UN General Assembly upgraded its status to a non-member state, putting it on a par with the Holy See. This means it can apply for entry to UN bodies, and is now a member of UNESCO. However, Palestine needs the prior approval of the UN Security Council to be admitted as a full member state. Until now, it has failed to marshal the backing of at least nine of the 15 member states required to bring a resolution to the vote. Despite this, Palestine might try to table a motion to improve its prospects of statehood next month. The Palestinian delegation at the UN has circulated a draft resolution seeking an end to Israel’s 47-year-long occupation by November 2016 if negotiations with Israel have failed to secure a two-statement settlement by then. France could yet be the swing player. If it voted in favour, other countries might follow suit. Israel would then look to President Obama’s administration to veto the resolution.  For all the diplomatic machinations, Israel argues, with some Western backing, that the reality on the ground is what counts. The reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under prime minister Rami Hamdullah, an appointee of president Mahmoud Abbas, helps Palestine edge towards fulfilling the Montevideo attributes. But as one Israeli official points out, it still has two separate security forces, no defined borders or capital, and under the Oslo Accords is formally limited in conducting its foreign policy. In addition, Palestinians remain under Israeli military occupation with all but one of their entry and exit points controlled by Israeli forces. Only when negotiations which began in 1991 come to fruition, says Israel, can Palestine hope to gain independence and secure recognition from the states that matter. Palestine’s UN diplomacy might win it more of the international trappings of a state, but without a deal with Israel the reality for its people will remain the Israeli occupation.

https://www.economist.com/leaders/2002/04/11/from-here-to-palestine,"Getty  ARIEL SHARON invaded the West Bank in order, he said, to uproot terrorism and isolate Yasser Arafat. In the casbah of Nablus, the Jenin refugee camp and other towns and villages, Israeli soldiers appear to have killed several hundred armed Palestinians, and by most accounts many unarmed ones too. But it is Mr Sharon, not Mr Arafat, whom this onslaught has isolated. By defying the demands to withdraw issued by the United Nations, the United States and almost everyone else, Mr Sharon has enraged Israel's enemies, alienated its friends, and blackened its name in the court of world opinion. To judge by his rising popularity at home, Israelis consider their international reputation a price worth paying for better odds of not being blown up on the bus to work. But the personal safety Mr Sharon promises them is illusory. The daily suicide attacks that provoked Israel's invasion stopped for nine days after the army went in, only to resume on the tenth. If Mr Arafat's fief were a state, it might be deterred from future violence by Israel's overwhelming force. But it is now even less of a state than it was before, less able than before to restrain the suicide bombers even if Mr Arafat wanted to. And in the meantime it is not only Israel's good name that Mr Sharon is destroying. He is also destroying something more precious: the belief of Israelis and Palestinians alike in the possibility of a just compromise between the claims of the two peoples.  Trapped in their endless blame game, each side accuses the other of killing hope. Both are right, in that both have failed. Mr Arafat has failed to honour his promise under the Oslo accords to prevent the territories he controls from being used as a springboard for guerrilla and terrorist attacks on Israel. But Mr Sharon has failed to offer Palestinians any believable prospect that they might realise their aims by non-violent means. If this were just a case of refusing to bend under fire, Mr Sharon's failure might be forgivable; most Israelis believe that surviving depends on showing no weakness. The trouble with Mr Sharon is that he seems not to accept the principle upon which any imaginable peace must rest, namely Israel's evacuation of most of the land it conquered in 1967, so that a viable Palestinian state can arise in the West Bank and Gaza. Right now, he weeps crocodile tears over the collapse of the Oslo process he never supported. But under cover of fighting terrorism, he shows every sign of wanting to resurrect the vision of a “Greater Israel”, for ever in charge of the West Bank, which inspired Likud governments in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the Knesset this week, Mr Sharon promised to withdraw his army from the newly occupied territories, but only to “buffer zones”; to negotiate with a “responsible” Palestinian leadership, but not with Mr Arafat; and to seek a “long-term interim agreement”, not a final peace. He also expanded his government to take in the National Religious Party, led now by an ultra-nationalist who opposes any Palestinian sovereignty west of the River Jordan and predicts the eventual migration of the Palestinians out of the country.  If this is the fate that awaits the Palestinians after a ceasefire, Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, will have been wasting his time trying to arrange one. For such a ceasefire has absolutely no prospect of lasting. Having endured 35 years of long-term interim occupation, the Palestinians are in no mood to submit again to Israel's iron fist. As for Mr Arafat, it is no use Mr Sharon calling Mr Powell's decision to meet the Palestinian leader a “tragic mistake”. Like him or loathe him, whether he has condoned terrorism or not, he is the only leader whose legitimacy the Palestinians and therefore the rest of the world are prepared to recognise. If there is to be any sort of negotiated peace, it is going to need Mr Arafat's imprimatur. A negotiated peace looks more remote than ever. So the priority of George Bush, wary of tangling himself as Bill Clinton did in the arcane grievances of Arabs and Israelis, is to put out the fire before it spreads and complicates his plans for Iraq. But what a pity if this were the limit of his ambition. If the present mayhem shows anything, it is that the fire cannot be doused without also reviving hope. Israelis need to be able to hope that the terror will end without their soldiers having to stay in the West Bank to fight it. And Palestinians need to be able to hope that if the terror ends, the occupation will end too. If America is serious about restoring hope, it cannot rely on its existing three-step plan for ending the intifada: a ceasefire, followed by resumed security co-operation, followed by confidence-building measures such as a freeze on Jewish settlements. For a paradoxical consequence of Mr Sharon's war is that this progression of modest steps now looks even less realistic than an immediate “leap” to a final peace. The Palestinian policemen fighting today alongside Palestinian gunmen cannot be expected to turn their brethren over to Israel tomorrow. Israel cannot be expected to trust them to. And even if some miracle eventually got them to the negotiating table, the gap between Messrs Sharon and Arafat looks unbridgeable. This is why it is now time to risk that leap to a final settlement. This can no longer be based, as Oslo was, on the two sides making their own agreements and learning over time to trust one another; the gradualism of Oslo built hate, not confidence. So outsiders will have to do the work. For example, since Mr Arafat cannot or will not clamp down on terrorism, why not send an international force—armed, not just “monitors”—to take charge of security in the areas under his control? Since the parties cannot negotiate secure borders, as Resolution 242 of 1967 asked them to, why not have world powers—the “quartet”, say, of America, the UN, the European Union and Russia—map out such borders for them, and set a deadline for Palestinian independence? None of this would help a jot unless those powers, and especially the superpower, put sustained pressure on both sides to comply. But how disgraceful it would be if the answer to those “why nots?” was that the world at large, while calling piously for both sides to see reason, simply lacked the will to save them from each other.

https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/08/03/a-distant-conflict-resonates-in-northern-ireland,"VISITORS to Northern Ireland need not venture far to discover that local people have strong views about another, even bloodier zone of conflict. In Catholic and Irish-nationalist parts of Belfast murals lament the sufferings of civilians in Gaza and proclaim support for hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners. In Protestant areas the Israeli flag is a common sight. One much-vandalised mural celebrates Colonel John Patterson, an Irish Protestant officer in the British army and ardent Zionist who commanded a Jewish legion in the first world war. Until a couple of years ago, a plaque in a tense part of north Belfast marked the boyhood home of Chaim Herzog, the late Israeli president whose accent recalled his native city. It was so regularly defaced that it was taken down. However much the two situations may differ, Northern Ireland’s rival communities identify with opposing sides in the Middle East with a passion which at times seems to exacerbate their local differences. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is helping to keep Britain’s Conservatives in power, takes a staunchly pro-Israel line, hewing to the hawkish end of the Israeli spectrum. This reflects the feelings of its Protestant voters, some of whom are influenced by Christian Zionist thinking. In a British parliamentary debate earlier this year, Ian Paisley junior, son of the DUP’s founder, argued that Israel should not be asked to dismantle settlements unilaterally. “Settlements are a symptom of the conflict in Israel; they are not the cause,” he insisted. According to Steven Jaffe, co-chair of a lobby group called the Northern Ireland Friends of Israel, Ulster Unionists admire Israeli military prowess and what they regard as stoicism in the face of terrorism. In 2014, when the British House of Commons voted on the principle of recognising a Palestinian state, five of the 12 “no” votes came from the DUP. Sinn Fein, the most popular party among Northern Irish Catholics, has a pro-Palestinian tradition which goes back to the 1970s when Palestinian fighters were giving active help to Irish Republican ones. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, recently took the Dublin government to task for failing to recognise the statehood of Palestine or support Palestinian hunger-strikers. Encouragingly, relations between the two conflict zones go beyond name-calling between politicians or street artists. Ever since the 1990s, when peace agreements brought some stability to both places, there has been a steady exchange of visits involving scholars, NGOs and peace activists in search of lessons that might be transferred from one region to the other. In June, for example, a delegation from IPCRI, a peace-minded think-tank based in Jerusalem, reported favourably on a visit to Belfast. Despite the breakdown of the power-sharing administration of Northern Ireland, the visitors were gratefully amazed that in municipal affairs, the DUP and Sinn Fein could rub along pragmatically. “We learned in Belfast that a reconciliation process is possible, albeit long and exhausting,” they reported. Still, when storms blow up in Jerusalem, currents of turbulence reach Belfast, as an incident this summer shows. Last year, a London-based NGO called Forward Thinking managed against the odds to arrange a meeting in Belfast between members of Israel’s ruling Likud party and Sinn Fein. It was controversial: some Palestinians, especially those involved in co-ordinating an international boycott campaign, accused their Irish friends of betrayal. Last month the NGO tried to set up a similar meeting between the two groups, but this time Sinn Fein declined. It said that, although it still believed in “critical engagement with all parties”, it would turn down the invitation as a gesture of protest against the disturbances around Jerusalem’s holy places."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/the-palestinians-need-new-leaders,"Few experiences are more humiliating for Palestinians than plodding through the Israeli checkpoint at Qalandiya, where the West Bank’s administrative headquarters at Ramallah are separated from the Palestinians’ would-be capital in east Jerusalem. Young Israeli conscripts bark orders at middle-aged labourers queuing to cross. Meanwhile the Palestinian workers can hear the roar of Israeli commuters who live in settlements on nearby Palestinian land zooming along a four-lane motorway barred to Palestinians, en route to jobs in Tel Aviv. “The humiliation is a tax I have to pay to feed my six children,” says a day labourer trudging to work in Israel. Seventy-five years after the UN voted to divide Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state, Palestinians are still waiting for one. While Israelis celebrate May 14th 1948 as their day of independence, Palestinians mourn their naqba, or catastrophe, when some 700,000 of them were forced from their homes or just fled. Israel now rules over 7m Palestinians, including those in Israel and in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are internationally regarded as the basis of an independent Palestinian state. Another 7m are strewn across the Arab world and beyond, about half registered as refugees (see map). Palestinians are a slight overall majority in the territories controlled by Israel and in Israel proper. But they are divided over how to build a future. At times statehood has beckoned. In 1993 Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), the Palestinians’ representative body, signed the Oslo accords that provided for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank under a Palestinian National Authority (PA) and an end to Israel’s occupation within five years. It never happened. Israel withdrew its forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but since 1993 it has more than quadrupled the tally of Jewish settlers in the West Bank to over half a million, excluding East Jerusalem. Meanwhile the PA has rotted. Hamas, an armed Palestinian Islamist movement, won a general election in 2005 and set up a separate administration in Gaza, leaving an enfeebled PA to run bits of the West Bank. Jewish settlers there, including Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, have become a menacing power behind Binyamin Netanyahu’s coalition government.  It has withheld tax revenues that fund the PA. Foreign donors, discouraged by corruption within the PA, have cut aid. America’s Congress, viewing the PA as an instrument of terrorism, have long been loth to fund it. The West Bank’s 3.2m Palestinians, by contrast, resent the PA for seeming to acquiesce in Israel’s occupation. The PA’s ailing 87-year-old president, Mahmoud Abbas, and his Fatah party have stifled democracy. Nineteen years into a five-year term, he has repeatedly postponed elections. In 2007 he closed down the parliament. In 2018 he dissolved it. A recent opinion poll said 77% of Palestinians wanted him to resign; four-fifths consider his regime corrupt. The West Bank’s economy has festered. Frustration is rising. A new intifada, or uprising, could erupt. Last year’s West Bank death toll from violence was the highest since the end of the previous deadly intifada in 2004. This year’s rate so far has been higher. Gaza is more hopeless still. “It’s practically a separate state,” says a former head of Israeli intelligence, Tamir Hayman. Israel controls its borders, sea and air space so its 2.2m people feel besieged, as if in an open-air prison. Income per person is less than a third that of the West Bank. Hamas rules with a heavy hand, by decree. It is officially wedded to armed struggle but, since Israel has smashed it whenever it fires too many rockets into the Jewish state, it has practised a measure of restraint. It repeatedly negotiates ceasefires with Israel, including one earlier this month after Islamic Jihad, another armed Islamist faction, fired scores of rockets and mortars to protest against the death of a Palestinian hunger-striker in an Israeli jail. In the past few days Israel’s air force has hit Islamic Jihad targets, killing at least 25 Palestinians. Hamas has been under local pressure to respond but knows that that would provoke an even fiercer, lethal Israeli response. So despair overwhelms Gaza and the West Bank. With no prospect of negotiations and foreign mediation, over 40% of Palestinians favour violence against Israel, according to a poll conducted by Zimam, a Palestinian ngo in Ramallah, and funded by the eu. Nearly 40% say they dislike the main Palestinian parties. Over 70% have lost hope in a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine co-existing side by side. Palestinian support for a two-state deal is highest among Israel’s 1.7m Arab citizens. Their income of $36,500 a head (measured in 2019) is eight times what Palestinian West Bankers earn and 30 times that of Gazans, at the last count. Alone among Palestinians under Israel’s control, they can vote and carry the same passports as Jewish Israelis. An Arab-Israeli party was part of Israel’s previous coalition government.  But the rise of Israel’s far right horrifies Arabs on both sides of Israel’s security barrier (in large stretches it is a six-metre-high concrete wall). Mr Smotrich says there is “no such thing as Palestinians” and has called for “finishing the job”, a euphemism for expelling Arab Israelis.  A growing number of Palestinians in the diaspora, including refugees, are paying less heed to the official PLO leadership under Mr Abbas. Instead they have begun to call for a one-state solution, where Jews and Arabs between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean would live together in a single democratic state—and where Arabs would have a slender overall majority.  Some Palestinians are looking again to regional leaders. Mr Abbas visited Saudi Arabia in April for the first time in years. A Hamas delegation has recently been there after an absence of eight years. The United Arab Emirates, which signed the Abraham accords that normalised relations with Israel in 2020, may be cooling towards it as Mr Netanyahu’s government lurches even further to the right. Meanwhile Mr Abbas’s refusal to appoint a deputy prompts fear of a power struggle within Fatah that could turn violent when he goes.  Opinion polls suggest that the vast majority of Palestinians want a true democracy. Some of the Western donors on whom the Palestinians rely have urged Mr Abbas to hold presidential and parliamentary elections that might bring Gaza and the West Bank back together under a single authority. It could rejuvenate its leadership and legitimise it, in the event of negotiations with Israel. Even Hamas, still ostracised as a terrorist organisation by most Western countries, has told diplomats it would accept a limit to the size of its representation in a new Palestinian parliament and would not bid for the presidency.  Indeed, elections might break the hold of both Hamas and Fatah over Palestinian politics. Opinion polls suggest that over 40% of voters—and a majority in the West Bank—want “none of the above”, preferring a pragmatic leadership to tackle the poverty and corruption currently winked at by what they see as brutal Israeli overlords. For the moment neither model—one state or two—looks remotely feasible. The essential first step before Palestinians can contemplate the distant future is to revive a democratic Palestinian Authority. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2002/09/12/crushing-palestine-is-no-answer,"AP  AN END to the Israeli-Palestinian tragedy stretches out of sight, but every so often there comes a chance which, if snatched, might alleviate today's pain. Each time, this chance is muffed. The hope of a ceasefire, or an opening to a less savage situation, is blown away, usually by some brutal deed. A lull in the violence, encouraging talk of some kind of interim agreement, is smashed, either by a terrorist bomb or by Israel assassinating a militant or raiding the heart of Palestinian territory. Terrorists calculate that they have an interest in maintaining a scary haze of violence. But what about Israel? Some of its leaders, it seems, also doubt that a peaceful respite would be in their best interests. The latest attempt to break out of the cycle of violence and oppression was the “Bethlehem, Gaza first” plan thought up by Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Israel's defence minister. In return for the Palestinians cutting down on violence, the Israeli army would relax its restrictions, first in the two named areas, and then elsewhere. The plan has worked in Bethlehem but has yet to be tried in Gaza, let alone anywhere else.  In reply to continued low-level Palestinian violence in Gaza, Israel has twice within two recent days driven its tanks deep into the territory. The unfortunate Mr Ben-Eliezer is trapped, and undermined, by a commanding combination from above and below. Both his prime minister, Ariel Sharon, and his new chief of staff, Lieut-General Moshe Yaalon, have made it plain that they have no time for his plan. Similarly, this week's call, by Yasser Arafat and his Fatah movement, for an end to killing civilians, received a swift brush-off.  General Yaalon has explained, lucidly and at length, the philosophy behind his determination to keep hammering the Palestinians until he gets their unconditional surrender. He is not a political right-winger, as his predecessor was, yet he believes the Palestinians pose a “cancerous” threat to Israel's very existence: they are not, in his view, fighting to end the occupation but to liquidate Israel itself. Israel, therefore, must go for total victory. The Palestinians must be beaten in an unambiguous way that sears into their obstinate minds that they must never try anything against Israel again.   The army has been given its head: its recent killing of 13 Palestinian civilians in three incidents got a quick military whitewash. Worse, the chief of staff opposes any pre-victory deal from which the Palestinians might scent Israeli weakness. Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, he argues, was a bad mistake that sent the wrong message to Israel's enemies.  Mr Sharon, who defends General Yaalon as “a level-headed person”, seems to share his views. He insists that Israel should concede nothing in the face of terrorism. That sounds reasonable, but all Palestinians, and some Israelis too, have come to believe that one of his main motives in giving the go-ahead to apparently poorly-timed pre-emptive action is to pre-empt a prolonged ceasefire. This, he fears, might evolve into a situation where he was under pressure to make territorial concessions in return for peace. “Oslo doesn't exist, Camp David doesn't exist, neither does Taba,” said Mr Sharon last week, dismissing the agreements, or attempts to get agreement, that were based on the principle of land for peace. Casting out the land-for-peace equation casts out Palestinian hope. General Yaalon's blanket charge that the Palestinians aim to eliminate Israel distorts the goal of a people living under occupation, most of whom are trying only to win back their land. And loss of hope breeds supporters for the terrorists. Last week, a nervous Israeli public saw a car carrying half a tonne of explosives stopped at a road block. This week, Palestinians were arrested for allegedly trying to poison food.  Such acts are despicable, and Israel has to guard itself against them. But the refusal to deal at all, implicit in General Yaalon's perception of the Palestinians as an enemy only to be flattened, leads directly to an open-ended war of attrition."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2005/04/07/life-in-the-armpits-of-palestine,"THESE days, the people of Kfar Qaddum have to come home by the back route, a bumpy dirt track that weaves between sickly-looking olive trees, where cars get stuck when it rains. Three years ago the army closed its link to the main road to Nablus because, for a few hundred metres, it runs through Kedumim, a nearby Israeli settlement. When the village ambulance needs to get to a Nablus hospital, its driver calls Kedumim's security people, who block the roads into Kedumim proper with vehicles before opening the gates at either end of the access road. Three people have died waiting.   When Israel's “security fence” in the West Bank is finished, it will run between Kedumim and Kfar Qaddum, and complete the seal (see map). Though the barrier route, revised in February, now hugs more closely the “green line” (which marked the boundary between Israel and Jordan before the war of 1967) and bites off less Palestinian land, it also extends numerous arms deep into the occupied lands, around the main Jewish settlement blocks. Caught in the armpits are dozens of Palestinian villages, places such as Jinsafut, wrapped in the embrace of the Ariel block. B'Tselem, an Israeli human-rights group, says that 53 communities will be surrounded on at least three sides by the barrier—nearly twice as many as under the previous route. And many other villages, such as Kfar Qaddum, have lost or will lose farmland and access to nearby towns. This is the final tightening of the economic noose imposed by Israeli security measures, which have barely relaxed since the Israeli and Palestinian leaders declared a ceasefire two months ago. Farming remains the only source of income for many Palestinians. The authorities take advantage of the often murky land registry to expropriate land Palestinians say is theirs. Kfar Qaddum says it has lost 5,000 dunams (500 hectares) of its 18,000, and will lose another 5,000 to the barrier. (“Not one centimetre of Kedumim is built on land known for sure to be private,” says Shlomi Khazon, the settlement's security officer.) Closing roads, meanwhile, has effects that range from the obvious, such as deaths in waiting ambulances, to the subtle but insidious. For instance, getting to Nablus by public transport now costs 25 shekels ($5.70) instead of five, says Nasser Akel, Kfar Qaddum's deputy mayor. So the 200 Kfar Qaddum students at university in Nablus now prefer to rent rooms there. But since tradition frowns upon unmarried women living away from home, women will become less likely to study.  The old barrier route called for a loop almost totally encircling the village of Nahallin, south-west of Jerusalem. That loop is gone; but it makes little difference. Nahallin sits right inside the Etzion block of settlements, with only one road out, towards Bethlehem. And on March 20th, the villagers found repossession orders hanging in their fields for nearly 2,000 dunams which the state claims as its own. It is the latest bite of a long series. One chunk, expropriated on security grounds, ended up as settlement real estate. In another case, after a long, thin strip was expropriated for building the (now cancelled) barrier, a much larger chunk behind it, though not officially confiscated, became inaccessible. By coincidence, perhaps, it was also on March 20th that the government confirmed plans to build 3,500 new housing units between Maale Adumim and east Jerusalem, filling a gap in a settlement corridor that cuts across the West Bank.  Israel's plan seems to be two-pronged. First, withdraw the settlers from Gaza. (Last month, Ariel Sharon, the prime minister, won the last battle against the withdrawal in Israel's parliament by defeating a referendum vote and a rebellion against the budget.) Second, surround the main West Bank settlements with the barrier and build so many Jewish homes there that giving them back to any future Palestinian state would be impractical.  America, which last year recognised the need to respect such “facts on the ground”, was caught off guard by the Maale Adumim announcement. Its officials issued conflicting statements. Only this week did George Bush, who is due to meet Mr Sharon next week, urge Israel once again to stop the settlement-building.  The cruel twist is that places like Kfar Qaddum and Nahallin are a low priority not only for Israel but also for the Palestinian Authority (PA). It has been busy with other things: a truce with Palestinian militants, preparations for local and municipal elections and negotiating with Israel over prisoner releases and the handover of security functions in the main West Bank Palestinian towns. “The PA isn't interested in us,” says Mr Akel. “We want it to put our case on the agenda for the negotiations with the Israelis.” But the barrier's most perverse effects are reserved for a handful of villages that have ended up in a legal twilight zone. Though they have been within the municipal boundary of Jerusalem since the eastern part was annexed in 1980, their Arab residents, for historic reasons, hold West Bank identity cards. Nu'aman, a hamlet on Jerusalem's south-eastern edge, is one such place. For years its children went to school in a nearby Jerusalem village, Um Tuba. But during the 1990s the problems began: first no building permits, then no access to the school, then arrests and harassment for villagers caught in Jerusalem without a permit, even though their homes are, officially, in the city. The road north to Um Tuba and Jerusalem was closed. And then, following plans to build the barrier between Nu'aman and the neighbouring Al-Khas, so was the road south to Bethlehem. The villagers petitioned a court to re-route the barrier to leave them on its West Bank side; then, when it became clear that they would lose access to a lot of farmland (their lawyer, Shlomo Lecker, says their claim to the land is shaky), they petitioned instead to get the blue identity cards of Jerusalem residents. Last month Nu'aman won a small victory. A court ruled that the army must give its residents a paved road to Al-Khas and free passage across the barrier until their residency status is sorted out. Meanwhile, they can apply for blue cards. But only those who can prove they have lived there since 1972 will get them, says Mr Lecker. That is, not many. And in any case they will be hemmed in, with the barrier on one side and a planned new district of the nearby Har Homa settlement soon to start sprouting on the hills next door. “Soon, you see,” jokes Jamal Darawi, Nu'aman's informal village head, with only a trace of bitterness, “we will have our independent state: Nu'amanistan!”"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/30/a-vision-for-the-palestinians-after-the-war,"He iS OFTEN mentioned as a possible future leader of the Palestinians. But in a lengthy discussion with The Economist from his home in Abu Dhabi on October 27th Muhammad Dahlan, a former security chief for the Palestinian Authority (PA) from Gaza, denied he wanted the role. In the interview, his first with the Western press since Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, attacked Israel on October 7th, Mr Dahlan did, however, lay out his vision for what should come after the war for Gaza. It was one of surprising hope, amid the horrors of the fighting. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas. Born in an impoverished refugee camp in the south of the Gaza Strip, Mr Dahlan rose through the ranks of Yasser Arafat’s Fatah movement, and spent much of the 1980s in Israeli prisons where he learned to speak fluent Hebrew. He was the Palestinian national security adviser when the PA lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007. He has connections on all sides of the conflict. He has enemies in Fatah—notably among the inner circle of Mahmoud Abbas, the PA’s embattled and ageing president. He was convicted of corruption in absentia by a Palestinian court in 2016. But he has plenty of friends too. And he grew up in the Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza alongside much of the current leadership of Hamas so can talk to the Islamist group. He also speaks warmly of his relations with some senior Israeli figures. Mr Dahlan rubbishes the suggestion that once the war ends any one individual could be shipped in to run Gaza. Instead he suggests a two-year transitional period with an administration run by technocrats in Gaza and the West Bank. That could, he imagines, reunify the Palestinian territories after more than a decade of infighting. After that he envisages parliamentary elections, based on a Palestinian state with, at that point, undefined borders. All Palestinian political factions should be allowed to participate, including Hamas (fears of a Hamas victory have been one of Israel’s main reasons for blocking Palestinian elections in recent years). Even after this war it would be impossible to govern Gaza without its consent, he argues: “Hamas will not disappear.” He believes that Arab states such as Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) could support such a body. This Palestinian state should then be internationally recognised, including by Israel. More immediately Mr Dahlan, who has recently returned from Egypt and has close ties with Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, pours scorn on the idea of allowing refugees into the Sinai peninsula as a way to relieve the crisis in Gaza. “Who is going to take this historical responsibility to be blamed by the Arab population for helping the Israelis to displace the Palestinians?” he says, noting that the mass displacement of Palestinians into Egypt would create serious national-security issues for the government in Cairo. A parliamentary system as envisaged by Mr Dahlan would yield a prime minister to lead the Palestinians. That would mean doing away with the presidency currently filled by Mr Abbas. Mr Dahlan is in favour of such a shift. It is an “illusion” that any one man can solve the Palestinian issue, he insists: “The time of the heroes passed away with Arafat.” Responding to rumours that he may be Israel’s choice to run Gaza after the war, he rejects the suggestion that he would come in to clean up the mess once the fighting ends. And yet he firmly sets out his credentials for leadership; he knows Gaza well and has spent 40 years fighting for the Palestinian cause, but he also claims to know the Israelis. He has become a close adviser to Muhammad bin Zayed, the powerful ruler of Abu Dhabi, in recent years. He claims to have channelled around $50m a year from the UAE into Gaza. He has also built a network of support in the West Bank’s refugee camps. To many, the Palestinian national movement has never looked in worse shape than in the days since Hamas’s attack, and Israel’s retaliation. The long-standing divisions between the leaderships in the West Bank and in Gaza have only worsened, and international backers of the PA have announced reviews of its funding. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and the PA seems weaker than ever. It would be easy to argue that the Palestinians are further away than ever from a state of their own. Yet Mr Dahlan is surprisingly hopeful. He sees an opportunity for the Palestinian cause even in the middle of war. The last month has changed things hugely for the Palestinians, he says. “Three months ago there was zero hope. Who was mentioning the Palestinian cause three months ago? Nobody… Now everybody is talking about our suffering.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/united-states/2008/12/04/subject-israel-palestine," “THE big question is: do you want to end this conflict or just tamp it down? The arguments for the first are self-evident. Palestine fouls up our diplomacy: Israel is thrown at us whenever we ask Muslim allies for help. Unsolved, this conflict generates wars. The last administration was tripped up by the Israel-Hizbullah war in 2006. Another round in Lebanon—or a small war in Gaza, or a big one between Israel and Iran or Syria—is possible at any time.  But the argument for just tamping down is also strong. Presidents who go for the whole package waste their time and fail. Jimmy Carter got peace with Egypt but nothing for the Palestinians. Hillary will tell you Bill spent more time on this than anything else in foreign policy, but he failed too. His excuse is that Arafat suckered him (“Don't you ever trust that son of a bitch,” was his parting advice to Colin Powell), but now that Arafat's dead the Palestinians have two addresses instead of one. The Europeans tell us that Hamas can live with a two-state deal, despite its spiel about destroying Israel. But if we talk to Hamas we knock the legs from under Mahmoud Abbas. For now he's still our Joe and the Palestinians' president. As for Israel, Ehud Olmert was a cooing dove compared to Binyamin Netanyahu, who looks like winning the election in February. He plays annoyingly well on the Hill and pushes the line that Abbas can't deliver and that Hamas is a terror front for Iran (which, by the way, he wants us to bomb).  Even if you decide against going the whole hog, you'll lose nothing by saying forcefully before Israel votes that we want a two-state solution with a shared Jerusalem and little modification of the pre-1967 line. Spell out the percentages. Netanyahu might as well know he won't get another free pass to jerk us around on settlements. Then, honour satisfied, you could decide to put the full package to one side and try something more modest, like peeling Syria from Iran by dangling the Golan Heights. Israel's own security people want a Syria deal.  If you want to get a settlement with the Palestinians too, we must start early and allow time. If Hillary is too grand to shuttle, appoint an envoy reporting to you to (1) make our Arab friends wangle Hamas back into a Palestinian unity government; and (2) get international buy-in to an “Obama plan”. This will in fact consist of the “parameters” Bill Clinton drew up in 2000 and are the nearest you'll get to a sellable compromise. Hillary must help you sell this in New York as well as Riyadh. Only then should you step in to close the deal—after figuring out what mix of heat and reassurance to apply to the Israelis. They're the ones who have to give up something real.”"
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/11/15/despite-its-sympathies-egypt-is-unlikely-to-help-palestinian-refugees,"To read more of The Economist’s data journalism visit our Graphic detail page. THERE IS ONLY one viable way out of Gaza: through Egypt’s border crossing in the south of the enclave. Since the war Egypt’s government has kept it shut to refugees, though it has historically had sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the country’s president, says that opening the border raises the possibility that Palestinians could lose Gaza, and become unable to return. But Egypt has more self-serving motivations, too. A rush of refugees from Gaza could revive the Muslim Brotherhood, the political Islamists who have long been the biggest internal threat to Mr Sisi. The country has also been severely affected by a mass movement of people caused by another conflict in the region (see map). That is putting pressure on Egypt’s fragile economy and making it all the more hostile to the idea of re-homing Palestinians. Amid war in Gaza, the spotlight on a brutal civil war in Sudan has faded. Fighting broke out in April when Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of a rebellious paramilitary group, tried to seize control of the country from General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads the Sudanese Armed Forces. Since then thousands of people have been killed in fighting between the two groups, and more than 6m people have been displaced from their homes—around 1.2m of whom have fled across its borders. In the first three months of fighting, Egypt received the highest number of people fleeing the war. More than 250,000 people sought shelter there, though the real number is probably higher. In greater Cairo the influx reportedly sent rental prices soaring. Resources are scarce elsewhere, too. Due to the government’s poor handling of the economy, annual inflation hovers at 36%. Many Egyptians are struggling to buy food. Public schools—underfunded and overcrowded—rely on support from the United Nations. Egypt’s government cracked down in June on border crossings from Sudan, which has reduced the number of arrivals from 4,000 per day at the beginning of the crisis, to just 400 per week in September. By mid-July Chad had taken in more Sudanese refugees than Egypt (see chart). South Sudan now has too. Were the Rafah crossing opened to Palestinians, the number of new arrivals would probably dwarf those from Sudan. The enclave, home to 2.2m people, is becoming uninhabitable: 12% of the buildings have been damaged, and one in 200 people have been killed. Thousands of Palestinians have already made their way towards the Rafah border in search of food, electricity, water and safety. In the 1950s Egypt treated many Palestinian refugees as equals (though naturalisation remained out of reach for many). Egypt has made clear that those days are long gone.■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/01/18/might-they-want-to-join-palestine,"HARISH might have been Israel’s first city purpose-built for both Arabs and Jews. On the hilltops dividing the Mediterranean coast from the West Bank, bulldozers have been clearing the way to accommodate 60,000 inhabitants. Its first wave of Arab ones has already co-operated with ultra-Orthodox Jews to elect a mayor. And unlike neighbouring Jewish town councils, which went to court to stop Arabs living or burying their dead within their security gates, Harish’s officials portray a future where minarets and synagogues will coexist side by side. Yet if Israel’s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has his way, the city will be wrenched from its predominantly Arab surroundings. When Yigal Shachar, who heads the city’s special planning committee, draws a putative border between the states of Palestine and Israel, he draws a loop around Harish, including its happily integrated Arabs, keeping it firmly in Israel—but draws a new line around a concentration of nearby Arab-Israeli towns such as Ara, putting them into the adjacent West Bank, where the Palestinians hope to build their state. Ten years ago, when Mr Lieberman first proposed moving Arab-populated Israeli towns near the present border into Palestine in exchange for Jewish settlement blocs in the Palestinians’ West Bank being incorporated into Israel, he was branded a racist firebrand. Liberals accused him of promoting the forcible “transfer” plan, akin to ethnic cleansing, proclaimed by a rabbi, Meir Kahane, who vilified Arabs while calling for a pure Jewish state. Today, however, even some doveish Israeli left-wingers find such ideas reasonable. And when Mr Lieberman recently again proposed swapping Jewish-populated lands for Arab ones, not only did Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, stay silent, but American mediators declared that the foreign minister had joined the peace camp of those seeking a two-state solution. “No one will be expelled from his home, or have his property confiscated,” says Mr Lieberman. “We’re just talking about moving the border.” On his Facebook page, he recently mocked Arab parliamentarians who protested against the idea, teasing them as “lovers of Zion” for wanting to stay in Israel. But a recent poll in a liberal Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, found a growing number of Arabs backed it, too. Whereas 80% had decried it five years ago as another stage in the nakba, or catastrophe, as Arabs call their dispossession by Israel in 1948, over a third were now reported to be in favour. Many reasons have been aired. Israel’s policy of letting its Arab, but not its Jewish, citizens holiday and work in the West Bank’s Palestinian cities has strengthened ties between Arabs on both sides of the current border. And some of Israel’s secular Arabs are keen to shed their Islamists, whose wellspring lies in Wadi Ara, part of the area Mr Lieberman wants to swap. But the main reason Israel’s 1.7m Arabs increasingly identify with Palestine is the mounting rejection they face in Israel. Mr Lieberman’s dreams of casting them off and Mr Netanyahu’s drive for global recognition of Israel as a specifically Jewish state are alienating many of the more than 20% of Israelis who are Arabs. This growing sense of ostracism has been reinforced by actions. Israel’s national bus carrier skirts Arab towns while serving Jewish outposts. The government builds industrial zones for Jewish towns but rarely for Arab ones. Though signposts are in Arabic as well as Hebrew, they are often spelt wrong. “We thought we were citizens in a democracy,” says Makbula Nassar, a fiery broadcaster on Radio Shams, an Arabic radio station in Israel. “Despite decades of dispossession, communal violence was minimal. But we discovered that we were always considered the enemy.” An Arab dentist in an Israeli hospital sees his hopes of coexistence wither, as the conflict that was largely about territory turns religious. An Arab lawyer fears her lifetime of trying to integrate into Israel will be worthless. “I’m an expert in Israeli law. How will I practise in Palestine?”"
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/12/a-short-history-of-gaza,"ON OCTOBER 7TH Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip, attacked Israel, killing 1,300 people and taking dozens of hostages. Israel has responded with force: strikes on Gaza had killed around 1,400 Palestinians by October 12th. Residents of the strip, a 360-square-kilometre block of land wedged between Egypt, Israel and the Mediterranean, are no strangers to tragedy. Since 2007 they have suffered a stifling blockade and a series of wars. How has the history of Gaza shaped its people? Palestine, which had been part of the Ottoman Empire for the better part of four centuries, was seized by the British in 1917, during the first world war. That year Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, pledging vague support for a Jewish “homeland” in Palestine. After the war Palestine was administered by Britain, and Zionist immigration, which had begun in the late 19th century, increased. Tensions between Jewish and Arab residents rose and in 1936 the Arabs revolted. By 1939 their uprising had been suppressed—but Britain palmed off the problem to the United Nations, which voted to partition the land. Britain soon withdrew. In 1948 the state of Israel was created. Five Arab countries immediately invaded and Israel triumphed in the nine-month war that followed. About 750,000 Palestinian Arabs were uprooted. Many ended up in the two pockets of land retained by the Arabs: Gaza, controlled by Egypt, and the West Bank, administered by Jordan. Conditions in Gaza were dire: many people slept in barracks, schools and mosques. Refugees in the strip were not allowed to enter Egypt, nor to return to Israel. They were trapped and stateless. In 1967, during a six-day war with Egypt, Jordan and Syria, Israel seized Gaza and the West Bank. Life in Gaza improved little under Israeli occupation. By the mid-1980s about 250,000 Palestinians, 10% of the population of the occupied territories, had been detained or interrogated, says Ian Black in “Enemies and Neighbours: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017”. Israel established Jewish settlements in Gaza, angering Arab residents. In 1987 Palestinians rose up, in what became known as the first intifada, or “shaking off”, a sustained movement of violent protests that lasted years. In 1993 Israel and the Palestinians signed the Oslo peace accords, a five-year interim agreement that was meant to give the Palestinian people the right to self-determination. The Palestinian Authority (PA), a new entity, assumed limited control of Gaza and the West Bank, although the Israeli occupation continued. Negotiators could not agree on the thorniest of issues, such as settlement expansion and who would control Jerusalem, and Hamas, which had emerged during the intifada, embarked on a campaign of suicide-bombings to oppose the accords. The peace process ran aground. In 2000 Palestinians rose up again in the second intifada. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, in part because it was so costly to hold. A year later Hamas won a majority in a Palestinian election and formed a unity government with Fatah, its political rival. In June 2007, after a brief civil war, the militants assumed sole control of Gaza, leaving Fatah to run the PA in the West Bank. In response Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the coastal strip, strangling its economy. Although the Israeli government has issued thousands of work permits in recent years, allowing Palestinians in Gaza to cross the border to earn money, conditions in the strip have improved little. In 2022 the unemployment rate was 47%, and 70% for the young; eight-hour blackouts are a daily occurrence. As well as the blockade, people in Gaza have suffered the consequences of four wars, waged by Hamas and Israel. Between 2008 and 2023, these conflicts and various other outbursts of violence killed 5,360 Palestinians in Gaza and injured 63,000. The latest conflict promises yet more misery. Israel has imposed a “full siege” on the strip, limiting access to fuel, electricity and food. A ground invasion appears imminent. Civilians in Gaza have already suffered much, but the worst may be yet to come. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2015/01/08/see-you-in-court,"THE “nuclear option” was how American and Palestinian officials described the application by Mahmoud Abbas, Palestine’s president, to join the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. His move follows a vote against a Palestinian attempt to have the UN Security Council set a deadline for Israel to end its occupation of territories it captured in 1967. It might open Israel—or Palestine—to charges of committing war crimes. Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the UN, said Palestine would join the court on April 1st. Before Mahmoud Abbas applied on January 1st to join the ICC, Israeli officials promised it would result in an appropriate “Zionist response”: the expansion of settlements that would in effect bisect the West Bank near Jerusalem. Moreover, said officials, an application would also effectively spell the end of talks to establish an independent Palestinian state: never again, they said, would Israel negotiate with Palestinians over the future of Jerusalem, an issue that would have to be the cornerstone of any agreement since both sides claim it as their capital. Given such hyperbole, the response of Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, looks fairly mild. For now he has acted as in past rows, by withholding customs revenues that Israel collects on behalf of the PA on Palestinian imports, a sum of $127 million that comprises two-thirds of Mr Abbas’s monthly budget. Even that act earned Mr Netanyahu copious reprimands. A spokesman for the Obama administration ticked him off. So did Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, the veteran if maverick hardliner from Mr Netanyahu’s own party, Likud, who has turned into Israel’s leading advocate of Israeli-Palestinian coexistence. Threatening Mr Abbas with bankruptcy and the Palestinian Authority (PA) with collapse, Mr Rivlin said, was bad not just for Palestinians, but for Israel too. He has a point. Israel’s retention of tax revenues has left Mr Abbas unable to cover this month’s salaries for 160,000 state employees. The president’s men insist that Mr Abbas’ critics, who always thought the old man was bluffing about joining the ICC, will now cheer rather than stir up the street. But unions representing PA employees are smarting from previous pay cuts. Banks might have the reserves to cover their salaries for only a couple of months. A Palestinian businessman asks: once the money dries up, for how long will PA security forces remain quiet before they start selling their guns to make ends meet? On a previous occasion when that happened in 2006, Hamas’s military wing was a willing buyer of weapons. Shortly thereafter it took over Gaza. Israel’s freeze on tax receipts, therefore, seems likely to be thawed just as previous ones were. Israel is appealing to a sympathetic Congress to withhold the $400m it gives the PA each year when Palestine brings its first petition to the ICC. But Palestinians hope that will not happen. “Will the Americans really topple one of the last secular rulers,” asks a Palestinian official, “while IS is itching to take over next door?” In any case, Saudi Arabia, which has chipped in cash before, sounds more sympathetic than normal. Now that Mr Abbas has followed through, the question is whether the ICC will do much. Israeli officials fret that soldiers travelling abroad may be subject to arrest. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are already said to be paying lawyers in western capitals to prepare the writs. Palestinians and their supporters abroad, meanwhile, hope to seek the prosecution for war crimes of any Israeli accused of occupying Palestinian territories. Among those that could be targeted is Uri Ariel, the settler housing minister who is driving the expansion of settlements on the West Bank. Yet both sides seem to invest the ICC with powers that it has never hitherto shown itself to have. And it could take many years for an investigation to reach conclusion. “Look at Africa,” says a sober Israeli official, in reference to investigations that have stalled in Kenya and Sudan. Just a few days after the Palestinian application, Israel’s Supreme Court (which prides itself on keeping on the right side of international law) prevented the government from building its separation barrier through Battir, a delightful West Bank village set on a gorge through which the old Ottoman railway line to Jerusalem passes. The monks of Cremisan, whose monastery is also threatened by the barrier, wonder whether Israel’s judges will similarly spare their property. If not, they could turn out to be among the first applicants to head for the international court."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/16/to-save-palestinian-lives-in-gaza-open-the-crossing-into-egypt,"The ground war has yet to begin, and already casualties are mounting. Gaza’s 2m people are kettled inside a space that is more densely populated than London. As we write, the count from inside the enclave is over 2,500 killed and almost 10,000 wounded. Because the median age in Gaza is just 18, many of the dead are children. Israel is determined to destroy Hamas. Urban warfare is bloody and intense. Something terrible is about to unfold. That is why, starting with the UN secretary-general, the search is on for ways to save lives—both inside Gaza and by preventing the fighting from spreading to Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, is travelling tirelessly across the region. His boss, Joe Biden, may soon visit Jerusalem. Amid this frenzied diplomacy, governments, aid agencies and Palestinian sympathisers are issuing desperate pleas for Israeli restraint. That aim is noble and just. Unfortunately, calls on Israel to stay its hand are being undermined by well-meant naivety and by double standards. As Mr Blinken is demonstrating, the only realistic path to protecting the innocent lies in hard-headed negotiations, and nowhere more so than over plans to open up the crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Mr Blinken’s first job is to set expectations of well-meaning people. They often assume that killing civilians must always be against international law. However, Hamas terrorists have just demonstrated the gravity of the threat they pose by murdering 1,400 Israelis. In response, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) can lawfully make its country safe by destroying Hamas weapons, fortifications and fighters. Because the land beneath Gaza City is honeycombed by Hamas tunnels, a ground offensive is needed. The awful fact that many civilians will die, even if Israel tries to protect them, is not collective punishment of the Palestinians, but the ugly face of urban warfare. Outsiders are entitled to ask Israel to allow medical supplies, food and water into Gaza. There is room for argument about what counts as proportionate force and whether Israeli warnings to civilians are adequate. In the past, Israeli action has sometimes been excessive because the IDF has wanted to demonstrate that violence does not pay; and in recent days the defence minister has stooped to calling Hamas terrorists “human animals”. All too often, however, when people place demands on Israel’s conduct they betray double standards—because they do not take account of Hamas’s tactic of putting Palestinians in harm’s way. In the 16 years that it has run Gaza, the group has not sought to help people prosper, but to strengthen its grip on power and to recruit and arm its militants. It does not protect Gazans in war, but uses their bodies as living armour. In the past it has exploited mosques, schools and hospitals to stash arms and conceal command posts. On October 13th Israel warned northern Gazans to flee ahead of its invasion. Hamas did not help them evacuate or attempt to win them safe passage to the south by releasing the 199 Israeli hostages it is holding. Instead it tried to manipulate them so that they would stay put in the line of fire. It knows that the toll of dead Palestinian women and children will create an international outcry. How, then, to save innocent lives? Part of the answer is to appeal to Israel’s self-interest. Destroying Hamas would be within the laws of war, but if the cost of obliterating it is the death of many innocent civilians, the harm to Israel’s reputation will rapidly climb. In addition, the bloodier the fighting in Gaza, the more likely Hizbullah will attack in earnest from its bases in Lebanon. Israel does not want a second front. Another part of the answer is to appeal to Israel’s values. Mr Blinken put it well when he echoed the sentiments of his president in Israel at the end of last week. “How Israel does this matters,” he said, standing beside Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. “We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard.” The immediate task is to save lives by persuading Israel to allow Egypt to open the Rafah crossing between Gaza with the Sinai peninsula. The hundreds of thousands of people moving south of the Wadi Gaza, a boundary set by Israel, will need food, shelter and medical aid on a huge scale. Supplies are being stockpiled on the Egyptian side, waiting to be allowed across into Gaza. Talks are focused on letting dual passport holders and aid workers out of Gaza as the aid goes in. A deal here is urgently needed. That is unlikely to be enough. To save as many lives as possible, Egypt should also open the Rafah crossing to Palestinians wanting to flee temporarily from Gaza. It is easy to find reasons to object to such a plan. Palestinians understandably fear that they may never be allowed home. The precedent for that is on display in decades-old “temporary” refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. For its part, Egypt would not like to be seen to connive in emptying Gaza. It also fears that permanent camps could breed Islamist terrorism that aggravate instability in the Sinai, or blow back into the rest of the country. If, years from now, camps become bases for attacking Israel, they might even poison relations between Egypt and Israel, a cornerstone of Middle East security. To guard against all of those things, Israel, America, Egypt and well-meaning Arab states, including those who have signed up to the Abraham accords—and Saudi Arabia, which may one day do so—should make a formal guarantee, underwritten by the United States, that the flight into the Sinai would be temporary. Egypt, which is in economic difficulties, may be more amenable if Arab states were to offer it relief on its debts. America could grease the wheels. We do not underestimate how hard such an initiative would be to pull off. In the old Middle East the very idea would have been unthinkable. But when Hamas started to massacre Israelis, that world was lost. A new Middle East is up for grabs and Iran, Hizbullah, Hamas and the forces of disorder intend to claim it. What better way to deny them than by a joint plan to save Palestinian lives? ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/27/two-states-or-one,"HAVE MORE time and effort ever been devoted to peace to so little effect? America began overseeing talks between the Israelis and Palestinians three decades ago. But the Holy Land remains contested by two peoples who cannot bring themselves to live together. The fighting in May that left 242 Palestinians and ten Israelis dead accomplished nothing except to clear the field for the next round of fighting. The peace process set up in the Oslo accords in 1993 aims to create two states that agree to disagree—using land swaps, security guarantees, a deal to share Jerusalem and a limited “right of return” for Palestinians. Israel’s prize was to be a thriving democracy and a sanctuary for Jews; for Palestinians it was the promise of self-rule. At times, peace has been tantalisingly close, only to recede again amid mutual recrimination. Today, however, instead of being a pathway to peace, the two-state “process” is barring the route. Everyone pretends that peace is still on the agenda when, in reality, it is not. That is a formula for strife. Almost everything that matters can be deferred with the promise that, one day, it will be resolved in a deal that is perpetually over the horizon. It is also a formula that, by default, leads to a single state. The idea that the two-state framework is harmful will not come as news to the Palestinians. Under it, the vision of a viable, contiguous, sovereign Palestine has receded. Palestinian territory in the West Bank is an archipelago in an expanding sea of Israeli settlements that are illegal under international law. Gaza is a solitary island, cut off by an Israeli and Egyptian blockade. The Palestinian Authority was supposed to be a government in waiting. Young Palestinians look on it as the agent of Israel’s occupation, even as they laud Hamas, the violent Islamist group that rules Gaza, for standing up to Israel. In place of the stagnant two-state effort, the new Palestinian vision is to demand individual rights in one state. Those in Gaza and the West Bank resent needing Israel’s permission (often withheld) to travel to see their families. The recent fighting was fuelled by a dispute over property in East Jerusalem, where most Palestinians are mere “residents”. Even Israeli Arabs complain of inequality and rose up during the fighting in Gaza. That leaves Israel in a quandary. It has thrived under Oslo. GDP per head has grown by over half in the past 30 years. Its Iron Dome missile-defence system largely shields it from Hamas’s attacks. A divided, weak Palestinian leadership suits Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who shows little interest in the Palestinians. And it’s not just him: the conflict did not feature much in any of the four elections Israel has held since 2019. This cannot last. The Oslo figleaf lets Israel claim that the occupation will be undone in a final deal. As the interim power in charge, it has no duty to extend full rights to the West Bank. But 54 years after the six-day war, the idea of a temporary occupation rings increasingly hollow. Without hope of an agreement, Israel’s critics have begun to talk of a “one-state reality”. This challenges Israel: as the Holy Land has as many Jews as Palestinians, it cannot remain both Jewish and democratic while permanently controlling all of that territory. Many critics of Israeli policy, including some liberal Jews, now compare the Palestinians’ treatment to apartheid. The Palestinian demand for rights is resonating abroad, not least in the halls of America’s Congress. By allying Israel to the Republican Party, Mr Netanyahu has helped make the Palestinians part of America’s culture wars. Progressives in the Democratic Party have started to declare that Palestinian lives matter. America is Israel’s most important ally. True, American aid matters less than it did and Israel now produces most of its own advanced weapons. It has relations with more countries, including its Arab neighbours through the Abraham accords. Yet if it drifts away from Europe and America and towards countries like Russia, China and populist India, it will be a blow to Israel as a Western, liberal and democratic ideal. More important, Mr Netanyahu’s “anti-solutionism” leaves his country less able than ever to navigate a future with the Palestinians. His embrace of the Jewish far right makes eruptions more likely even as it fires up militant Palestinians—witness the recent communal violence in Israeli cities. The wall that seals off Israel from the West Bank has led to deeper distrust between Arabs and Jews. The settlements, once thought negotiable, have become permanent obstacles to peace. The status quo has served Israel well but is not sustainable. Sooner or later there will be a reckoning that requires a new formula for living next to the Palestinians. Adhering to Oslo while undermining it in practice feeds the reality of one state—because it makes two states harder to realise. Instead of imposing peace in one top-down stroke of diplomatic brilliance, a more realistic aim would be to build it patiently from the bottom up. The guiding principle should be to focus on the human and civil rights of Palestinians. Israel will not grant Palestinians full rights tomorrow. But it can make its Arab citizens more equal by devoting resources to their communities. It could make the administration of Jerusalem more inclusive, so that tiffs over fencing do not escalate into war. It must take more responsibility for the suffering in the West Bank and Gaza—and work harder to alleviate it. A focus on rights also makes Palestinian leaders more accountable. They cannot easily demand rights from Israel that they deny their own people. Mahmoud Abbas is in the 17th year of a four-year term as president. His Fatah party is sclerotic. Hamas tramples the rights of its people, including women and minorities. Better Palestinian leaders are a prerequisite for peace. Abandoning Oslo carries risks, obviously. Unbound, Israeli settlers might push farther into Palestinian territory. Hamas, which wants a single state in which Palestinians would outweigh Jews, might redouble its resistance. But today’s path is even riskier. Peace always starts by acknowledging reality. It takes root by improving lives and renewing politics. That can flourish into something new. Then, one day, the parties can start talking again about a deal, whether of one state or two. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2006/05/04/shut-your-eyes-and-think-of-palestine," ARE Palestine's rival militias heading for civil war? Look, for instance, at the incident in Gaza last week when Fatah militiamen shot their way into the health ministry and would have captured its minister had Hamas's militiamen not rushed to his aid. Under Western and Israeli pressure, and amid mounting lawlessness, what is left of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Gaza seems bent on tearing itself to bits. Or so it appears.  AFP  Hamas ministers under Fatah's eyes But take note of a contrary development: preparations for a national dialogue, leading to a coalition government. The offer of talks was made last week in a letter that Abdel Aziz Dweik, Hamas's American-educated parliamentary speaker, wrote to Mahmoud Abbas. The president, a Fatah man, accepted “in principle”.  Most Palestinian politicians admit that their chances of surviving a tightening international and Israeli siege would be greater if they managed to close ranks. A coalition, many have come to believe, offers mutual benefit. It would give Fatah the chance to regain the hold over the authority that it lost in the elections, and stem Hamas's drive to displace it. A coalition might also reverse the domestic scorn that Fatah earned by smooching with the unholy alliance of outsiders bent on bringing the government down.  For its part, Hamas stands to win some of Fatah's international legitimacy and—of more immediate concern—the money without which it cannot govern. “National unity will enable the Arabs to stand firmly with the Palestinians, and weaken the American iron fist,” said Atif Adwan, a Hamas minister. Moreover, a coalition government would give cabinet ministers the cover and distance they need from the stalwarts who continue to resist the demand by America, Europe, Russia and the United Nations that Hamas recognises Israel's right to exist, honours previous PA agreements and forswears violence.  Ministers struggling to balance both books and dogma have already gone some way to conceding that change is inevitable. “A long-term ceasefire as understood by Hamas and a two-state settlement are the same,” says Omar Abdel Razaq, the finance minister. “It's just a question of vocabulary.” With criticism growing of his handling of the salary crisis, he claims that he would be only too happy to give up his job to Fatah, and return to teaching.  The attempts to bring Fatah on board have so far foundered on the agenda. Fatah has made four conditions: a joint political programme based on recognition of its “peace project”, a resolution of the conflict between Mr Abbas and Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, for control of the PA's institutions, the acceptance of factions other than Fatah in the coalition, and Hamas's inclusion within, and submission to, the authority of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Hamas says it wants to discuss all four, but rejects them as preconditions. A tentative date for talks, pencilled in for the start of May, was delayed until the middle of the month and seems now to have been pushed further ahead. Much can go, and is going, wrong. Muhammad Dahlan, an important Fatah figure in Gaza, declined Mr Abbas's request to join the preparatory team. Mr Abbas himself has not ruled out the prospect of dismissing the government. And some Hamas ministers have yet to abandon the hope that they might run the show alone.  But time is not on Hamas's side. Recent hopes that the Arab League might pay Gulf aid direct to civil servants' bank accounts have been dashed—after the Americans blocked it, says the presidency. And even were it to trickle in, this aid is insufficient to pay March's salaries, let alone April's.  With the economy all but frozen, Palestinians are beginning to tire openly of Hamas's readiness to put pride before prudence. In stark contrast to Hamas's success in the parliamentary elections, Fatah swept the board in last week's student elections at the Open University, the largest Palestinian academic institution. It also did well at elections in the Palestinians' biggest refugee camp, at Baqa in Jordan, hitherto controlled by an Islamist faction.  Some argue that Hamas's waning electoral fortunes are proof that sanctions are working. By their own estimates, Hamas ministers reckon that without sanctions-busting they have but a few months to survive. But their downfall is not a solution. Robbed of power, Hamas has given warning that it will abandon its political experiment—and deny Fatah the mandate to pick up the pieces. The entire PA system—president, Fatah and all—could come tumbling down, and with it all progress towards a peaceful two-state solution. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/02/a-new-type-of-palestinian-militia-is-emerging,"Even by the violent standards of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the night of February 26th was unprecedented. Hundreds of Israeli settlers rampaged through Hawara, a Palestinian town of 7,000 south of Nablus in the West Bank. They were enraged by the shooting dead of two brothers in Hawara earlier that day. For hours they set fire to houses and cars. One Palestinian was killed by gunfire (whose is unclear). For the most part the Israeli army stood by and watched. “They did fire tear-gas at Palestinians who were trying to come and help,” said one Palestinian, surveying the blackened front of his home. The gunman, so far unidentified, who killed the settlers is thought to have links to Lions’ Den, a new armed Palestinian group based in Nablus. It emerged in the aftermath of Israeli raids around the city last year, notably one in which Israeli forces killed Ibrahim Nabulsi, an 18-year-old who had led a then-unnamed group in a series of drive-by shootings at Israeli targets. Lions’ Den has since claimed dozens of attacks in the West Bank, including the killing of an Israeli soldier in October. Support for it is growing. Posters of members killed by Israel plaster the market in Nablus. West Bank shops sell pendants adorned with Nabulsi’s face. The group stands for a new kind of Palestinian militancy. Unlike other militias, the group claims no link to any Palestinian party. It has emerged amid dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority (pa), which calls for non-violent resistance in the face of increasingly deadly Israeli raids, and infighting between Palestinian factions. The group resists the elaborate agendas of Hamas and Fatah, says Mazen Dunbuq, an ex-leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade, a nationalist radical group attached to Fatah. “Their only aim is to resist the occupation.” The Israelis and Palestinians are finding the group hard to handle because of its disparate and dynamic nature. There is no leadership to negotiate with; deals cut with some members may not work for others. “It’s unlikely the Palestinian Authority will conduct any operations against them,” argues Mr Dunbuq. “They are the voice of the Palestinian street and the voice of the people. You can’t go against this stream.” Lions’ Den is feeding off the leadership vacuum in the pa, says Tahani Mustafa, an analyst in the West Bank for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think-tank. “Fatah has become so inclusive it stands for everything and nothing.” Established groups with little local support have lost control, she says. But when Lions’ Den calls for action, people respond. Outsiders are increasingly worried by the rising violence. During the attacks in Hawara, Israeli and Palestinian security delegations were meeting in Jordan, together with American and Egyptian officials, to try to lower tension before Ramadan, which begins later this month. Under pressure from Israel and America, the pa is trying to tame Lions’ Den. It has offered it salaries in exchange for surrendering its weapons. Members wanted by Israel would be offered protective custody in Palestinian jails. A few have agreed. But others have continued to fight.  More Israeli raids on the group look inevitable. But this will stoke radical sentiment, argues Ms Mustafa, not dampen it. And the new government of Binyamin Netanyahu, which relies on far-right and ultrareligious voters, is adding fuel to the fire. Mr Netanyahu did not condemn the settlers’ violence; he simply told them not to take the law into their own hands. Besides, Mr Netanyahu’s coalition includes those who openly side with the arsonists. A parliamentary member of Jewish Power, the party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national-security minister, was on the scene at Hawara. Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, said the town should be “wiped out”. The next day the party boycotted a session in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, instead going to an illegal settler outpost that the army was trying to evacuate, and called for tougher measures against the Palestinians. Mr Netanyahu must get serious, said one party member, “if he doesn’t want to see more events like Hawara.” If and how the prime minister will manage such threats is unclear. ■ "
https://www.economist.com/lexingtons-notebook/2010/08/21/barack-obama-makes-his-push-for-palestine,"I RETURN from holiday just in time to catch a briefing from a senior administration official on Barack Obama's success in at last persuading Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, to start direct talks with Israel's prime minister, ""Bibi"" Netanyahu. There is to be a grand opening in Washington on September 1st, attended by Messrs Abbas and Netanyahu, with Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah acting as chaperones. Talks between Israel and the Palestinians will then ensue, which the administration expects to reach completion, ie, agreement on a final peace settlement, within a year. It is easy to be cynical about the scope of this supposed breakthrough. By getting the two sides back into direct talks Mr Obama has merely returned to where George Bush was after his Annapolis summit of November 2007. Big deal: the direct talks initiated then got nowhere, even though Israel's prime minister at the time, Ehud Olmert, was far readier for territorial compromise than is Mr Netanyahu. Even if, by some miracle, the two men came close to agreement, Hamas is still absent from the table. This means that half of the Palestinian movement would not be party to any deal and will try hard to sabotage one. So indeed will those Israelis in Bibi's governing coalition who for reasons of ideology, security or both vehemently oppose the creation of a Palestinian state. It is better for the parties to be talking than not talking, but a betting man would not favour the chances of a breakthrough to peace. That said, it would be a mistake to put the chances of success entirely at nil. When Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas hit the inevitable impasse, the Americans, who intend to be actively involved in the process through the person of George Mitchell, will doubtless table a bridging proposal. And this is the point at which the script could begin to depart from the precedent Mr Bush set at Annapolis. Mr Bush left his push in Palestine to the end of his presidency, and with the Iraq war to fight never saw the peace process as much more than a distraction or palliative. Mr Obama, on the other hand, started early, and seems determined to persevere despite the pushback he ran into from Israel's friends in Congress after his brutal confrontation with Mr Netanyahu over settlements in the territories. America's president, in short, shows every sign of being a true believer in the necessity of solving this conflict, not least in order to redeem the promises he gave the Muslim world in his famous Cairo speech. A year from now, when the negotiation ""deadline"" expires, he may be approaching the final year of his presidency—but for all the parties in the region know he might still have another four-year term ahead of him. That will make it more expensive for the Israelis or Palestinians to resist whatever bridging ideas America brings to the table. Another point: America's relations with Israel are more than ever focused on the pressing question of Iran and its purported nuclear-weapons programme. The administration has been saying lately that even if the Iranians went hell-for-leather for a bomb right now, it would take them at least a year to build a single device. This suggests that if Mr Netanyahu takes the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran half as seriously as he claims he does, he cannot risk being indifferent, especially over the coming year, to the quality of his relations with the superpower. The administration would surely never express the linkage this crudely, but there is here the making of a grand bargain: greater Israeli flexibility towards the Palestinians in return for ever-closer co-operation against the threat from Iran. As I said, a betting man would not favour the chances of a rapid breakthrough after the Washington summit. The Hamas conundrum is a huge obstacle. But this meeting may turn out to be much more than a reprise of the Annapolis failure. (Photo credit: AFP)"
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2002/04/04/carnage-in-israel-conquest-in-palestine,"AMID carnage and devastation, and before an apprehensive worldwide audience, two old adversaries, both in their 70s, duel bloodily in a showdown that could eventually turn out calamitous for the entire region. Never before has the Israeli-Palestinian conflict looked so dangerous, or so insoluble without dramatic outside intervention.  Long gone are the days when Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat unconvincingly acted out their parts as statesmen, negotiating agreements. Both are now performing in their own true characters. There they are: the extreme Jewish nationalist who believes in Israel's God-given right to fight for wider borders versus a wily old-time resistance leader, prepared to throw lives to the wind to fight for independence against the occupying power.  Israel's prime minister claims that his new assault on Palestinian cities and instruments of government, including Mr Arafat himself, is necessary to defend his country against atrocious acts of Palestinian terrorism. But, beyond this, Mr Sharon has gone to war to obliterate the advances made over the past decade by the Palestinian nationalists he is not prepared to accept. The Palestinian leader, for his part, either cannot or will not stop the suicide-bombers who turn Israel's calm streets into scenes from hell. But, with his back to the wall, Mr Arafat is once again the potent symbol of that Palestinian nationalism that Mr Sharon rejects. There can be no meeting of minds between the two. Mr Sharon has publicly regretted not “eliminating” Mr Arafat when, as Israel's minister of defence, he launched the invasion of Lebanon 20 years ago. But the conflict beween the two grisly old warriors is not personal in the sense, say, of the conflict between Saddam Hussein and George Bush father and son. It is a gargantuan tussle between the two national wills, Israeli and Palestinian, that Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat inadequately embody.  The region has been set on fire by the intifada, the second Palestinian uprising in less than a decade. After these revolts—and the seven years of negotiations that straddled them—Mr Arafat, speaking for all Palestinians, is not going to accept a political process that does not eventually end Israel's military occupation. And Mr Sharon, as one of the main architects of this occupation, is not going to accept any Palestinian leader who refuses to agree to the continuing existence of Jewish settlements, and the other facts born of the 1967 conquest. The result is that for one will to prevail, the other must be vanquished. And since neither has yet been vanquished, the violence soars. Mr Sharon profoundly opposes the Oslo peace process, which is based on Israel living securely beside a Palestinian state that contains most of the West Bank and Gaza. Instead, he sees a solution in a much more limited form of Palestinian autonomy (though he is happy to give this entity the trappings of a “state”) led by docile figures of his imagination.  He could not, when he was elected prime minister a little over a year ago, turn the clock back immediately. Instead he joined the diverse and powerful army of spoilers, led on the Palestinian side by militant Islamists, who have managed between them to sabotage the hopes of a permanent settlement along Oslo lines. The Palestinians are convinced that there can be no hope of a halfway decent political solution so long as Mr Sharon and his ilk are in control. But their leaders have done nothing to help the cause. On the contrary. Mr Arafat's brilliance as a resistance leader, keeping the gleam of Palestinian nationalism alive against all adversities, has been matched by lamentable bungling as chief executive of the Palestinian Authority (PA). He dithered over the intifada, sometimes encouraging it, sometimes trying to check it, more often letting it take its own course. Control slipped from him to the heads of the militia. Now, having helped to bring disaster on his people, he is again the brave resistance leader as Mr Sharon sets out to destroy him. What is now happening looks, feels and smells like war. It involves the largest call-up of Israeli reserve soldiers since the Lebanon war; the invasion and re-conquest of (so far) six of the eight main cities in the West Bank; Mr Arafat held captive in his Ramallah headquarters; skirmishes on Israel's northern borders; Israeli and Palestinian civilians killed in their dozens, by suicide-attacks or by military attacks of great ferocity. Since the second intifada erupted in September 2000, over 1,140 Palestinians and over 400 Israelis have been killed. Of these, 250 Palestinians and 124 Israelis perished last month alone, as Mr Sharon's military solutions moved seamlessly from shelling Palestinian areas to re-invading them, and Palestinian resistance went from guerrilla warfare to suicide-bombings in Israeli cities. AP  Tanks don't knock at the door   The latest and cruellest round in the conflict was triggered on March 27th. A Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up in a hotel in Netanya on the eve of the Jewish Passover holiday, killing 25 Israelis and wounding over 100. It was the worst atrocity carried out inside Israel in the 18 months of the intifada.  Mr Sharon declared his country at war and Mr Arafat an “enemy”, who, “at this stage, will be isolated”. The army was dispatched to invade Ramallah, Mr Arafat's “temporary” West Bank capital, and to enter his compound, besieging him on one floor of his three-storey office block. By candlelight, with his machinegun at his arm, the Palestinian radiated martyrdom.  Israel says the aim of its takeover of cities is to “uproot the terrorists” that have taken sanctuary within them. Palestinians say it is Israel's final assault on what is left of the PA as a prelude to the removal of the leaders themselves. Both are right, because Mr Sharon defines the PA as “a coalition of terror established by Arafat” . The Israeli army is now going after Mr Arafat's inner circle. It is pursuing senior security officials who had previously been considered immune, partly because they have worked closely with the CIA, and partly because some of them had been seen by Israel as pragmatic alternatives to Mr Arafat. The army is also going after Marwan Barghouti, Mr Arafat's top political lieutenant in the West Bank, who is thought by many Palestinians to be a possible future leader. Among the 25 or so Palestinians slain in Ramallah this week were five PA police officers, shot in the head in what Palestinians insist was a summary execution by the Israeli army. And one of the most telling events was Israel's aerial bombardment of the PA's Preventive Security Force (PSF) headquarters to compel the surrender of 200 Palestinians inside it. Until recently, the Palestinian police and the West Bank PSF were probably the only Palestinian security forces not engaged in fighting. The Israelis say that they are searching for, and weeding out, fugitives and terrorists. But, for Palestinians, the killing of their officers and destruction of their institutions is not primarily for this purpose. It is, said Jibril Rajoub, the PSF chief in the West Bank, about ridding from Palestinian consciousness “the symbols of an independent Palestinian state”.  Similarly, the Palestinians claim that the Israeli army's operations inside their cities are about seeking “submission”, not fugitives. For five continuous days Ramallah's 100,000 residents endured a total curfew, often without electricity, food or water; this was briefly lifted at mid-week, only to be reimposed. Offices were shelled, homes ransacked, ambulances shot at, hospitals raided, the dead left unburied, and roads, walls and cars crushed by the marauding, unassailable tanks. Palestinians in Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Jenin and Salfit suffered similar punishment. On April 3rd, an invasion army of some 400 tanks entered Nablus, to be fiercely resisted. Bethlehem is particularly tense, with guerrillas and soldiers fighting house to house and Israeli tanks laying siege to 150 Palestinians who have saught sanctuary in the Church of the Nativity.  The Israelis, on their side, suffer fear. In a response both visceral and calculated, the first five days of the Ramallah curfew saw Palestinian suicide-bombers hit West Jerusalem (twice), Tel Aviv and Haifa, leaving 18 civilians dead and scores injured. Israel is hoping to arrest or kill suicide-terrorists before they can act. But there is little that it can do to catch a Palestinian who wants to die wreaking havoc: not when, like Ayat Akhras from Bethlehem, she is 18, looks European and speaks Hebrew. She detonated herself in a West Jerusalem supermarket on March 29th, taking two Israelis with her. The streets of West Jerusalem are today as deserted and forlorn as those of East Jerusalem, its occupied sister. Few people leave their homes. And all are afraid. Is there any way of descending down this ladder of carnage and conquest? The Palestinian leaders' insistent demand is for international intervention. The gut reflex of most Israelis is for total separation, based on defensible borders. There is just one thought making the rounds that might satisfy both demands. Advocated by some Israeli politicians, and by some Palestinian intellectuals, it calls for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from all of Gaza and most of the West Bank, and for an international force “led by the Americans” to act as a buffer between the two peoples. The withdrawal would be deep enough to convince most Palestinians that one day they will be free. The buffer would be wide enough to give most Israelis the personal security they crave. Neither leadership would accept it. The Israeli government would say that any withdrawal would be “a victory for terrorism”. The Palestinian leaders say that an interim deal would be a defeat for a struggle that is to end “with independence and with that only”. But a majority of both peoples—weary, bloodied and scared—might welcome such an initiative."
https://www.economist.com/newsbook/2011/05/20/the-view-from-palestine,"FOR would-be Palestinian negotiators, there was much in Barack Obama's speech on the Middle East to applaud. For the first time an American president has articulated his country's commitment to two states based on the 1967 borders. He also called for a ""full and phased withdrawal of military forces""—ruling out a permanent military presence, though leaving open the possibility of a long-term interim one. He said a Palestinian state would border Jordan, thereby quashing any lingering Israeli demands that Israel retain a buffer in the Jordan Valley. To Israel's chagrin he also proposed that the parties first resolve their security arrangements and define their borders, before tackling what he called ""wrenching and emotional issues remain: the future of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian refugees"". Israeli officials have long preferred that nothing should be resolved until everything was resolved. ""We're pleased,"" says a Palestinian negotiator, who had days earlier been told that Mr Obama's speech would make only scant reference to Israel. There were, of course, some discomforting passages for Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. Mr Obama scoffed at his plan to secure recognition for a Palestinian state at the United Nations, warning him that it would be simply ""symbolic"". He made it clear that he would not again seek an Israeli settlement freeze as a precondition for kick-starting negotiations. He recognised Israel as a Jewish state, rather than one of all its citizens, Arab and Jewish alike. But the Palestinians have heard all this before. There was as much delight in what Mr Obama did not say. His failure to mention his meeting in Washington next week with Binyamin Netanyahu was seen by Palestinians as a snub to the Israeli prime minister. He abandoned his predecessor's commitment to allowing Israel to keep its West Bank settlement ""blocks""; instead he said land swaps should be mutually agreed. And he pointedly dropped any reference to the three conditions (the abrogation of violence, recognition of Israel, and respect of previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements) that America and its fellow Quartet members had set out five years ago for Hamas, the Islamist group that governs Gaza, as a price for engagement. Instead he said merely that Hamas's non-recognition of Israel raised questions. In short, says an intrigued international official in Jerusalem, this is the most pro-Palestinian speech ever by an American president. But is it too late for more negotiations mediated by America? Since the expiry of Israel's moratorium on settlement building last September, and the resulting collapse of a brief round of negotiations, the Palestinian leadership has distanced itself from reliance on American brokerage. The Arab spring has further increased pressure on Mr Abbas to bow to popular appeals for intra-Palestinian reconciliation and the unilateral pursuit of Palestinian core demands. In September, Mr Abbas plans to seek endorsement of a Palestinian state at the UN. To Mr Netanyahu's dismay, he has also agreed to heal the rift between the nationalist Fatah faction, which he heads in the West Bank, and its Islamist rivals, Hamas. On May 15th Palestinians refugees launched with his blessing a campaign of civil resistance aimed at encouraging the return of Palestinian refugees by breaching Israel's armistice lines. Palestinian officials still hope they can satisfy both their people and their external bankrollers. While agreeing in principle to restart negotiations, they plan to throw the ball back into Israel's court by demanding Mr Netanyahu accept previous agreements to suspend settlement building and agree terms of reference. Should Mr Netanyahu balk, as he is expected to do, Mr Abbas could then head back to the UN. But bucking the momentum for negotiations could prove easier said than done. Palestinian negotiators seeking to pocket Mr Obama's new parameters could come under pressure to suspend their unilateral measures. Mr Abbas would probably be accused of bad faith were he to accept the offer of borders along the 1967 lines but start a campaign to isolate Israel at the UN while efforts to resume negotiations were afoot. In an effort to woo Israel, he might also come under pressure to backpedal on his rapprochement with Hamas. (Mr Abbas had already delayed implementing his reconciliation deal with Hamas until after the Obama speech.) Similarly, he might also be pressed to rein in Palestinian civil resistance.  Fearing as much, some Hamas officials have already denounced Mr Obama's proposals as futile. They accuse the president of double standards—blessing popular uprisings, even armed ones, as struggles for freedom elsewhere in the Arab world, while condemning Palestinians for unilateralism. They rebuked their own, including Khaled Meshaal, the movement's Syria-based leader, for endorsing negotiations with Israel, have been pilloried by rivals within. After two decades of inconclusive negotiations overseen by America, Mr Obama will have an uphill struggle convincing Palestinians that their quest for statehood still goes via Washington, rather than acts of self-determination on the ground or the UN plaza in New York."
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/10/11/the-palestinian-cause-has-been-damaged-by-factionalism-argues-a-former-prime-minister,"THE HAMAS-LED attack on Israel was a case of the expected happening unexpectedly, and on an unprecedented scale. The preplanning was obvious, and the execution not only caught Israel off guard but disoriented it in ways it had arguably never experienced in the long history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. With Hamas eager to own the operation, much of the analysis has so far focused on its possible motives. To be sure, Hamas is a political movement, and speculation about its political motives and aspirations is understandable. But underlying its decision to escalate are a host of grievances, and not taking these seriously threatens to lead to much more disastrous consequences than have been seen so far. Those and other grievances are not felt by Hamas alone; they are legitimate, widely held Palestinian grievances. For who, among Palestinians, can be expected to be indifferent to the hardship and indignity of living under a highly capricious and oppressive occupation that has only been getting more deeply entrenched under the heavy weight of Israel’s expansionist colonial enterprise? In addition to the rapid intensification in the de facto annexation of the West Bank since the beginning of this year, there has been a substantial rise in violence by Israeli settlers and acts of outright terrorism against Palestinian civilians, as well as unprecedented hate speech by Israeli officials. Worse, much of that went largely unpunished. Nor did it lead to any meaningful adverse consequences for Israel internationally. As for Gaza—the tiny enclave that is home to 2.2m Palestinians—the talk about improving living conditions there after each of the previous five rounds of military escalation since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 merely ended up being largely that. More generally, Palestinians, not only in the West Bank and Gaza but throughout the world, have all but given up on the promise of statehood they thought might come with the so-called peace process three decades ago. This disillusionment has been reinforced by the normalisation agreements Israel concluded with four Arab countries in 2020, as well as by the growing realisation that the impending normalisation agreement with Saudi Arabia was virtually certain not to include a Palestinian component of any political significance. Add to that recent Israeli efforts to undermine status-quo understandings on the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem. This has fuelled Palestinian concern that the compound could be split up or, worse, damaged or destroyed. Given the sensitivity of this issue, not only to Palestinians but to Arabs and Muslims throughout the world, it is hardly surprising that Hamas dubbed its October 7th operation “the Al-Aqsa Hurricane”. All of which suggests that the objective Israel has now declared, of destroying Hamas, is unlikely to eliminate the possibility of future instability and conflict. As a political movement, with the ideology and the ideas it stands on, Hamas cannot be destroyed. Thus, Israel’s intention to turn Gaza into a “deserted island”, with all that would entail by way of doubling down on bombardment, not to mention a land operation, is likely to lead only to thousands more casualties, and to destruction, misery and displacement of untold proportions. This is not to mention the distinct possibility that such retaliation leads to further escalation and the eruption of a region-wide conflict. If the consensus is that Israel suffered a major intelligence and security failure last Saturday, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has been, arguably for decades now, suffering from a major doctrinal failure. The policymaking body, which is supposed to be the umbrella for all Palestinian groups and is considered the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, has made virtually no adjustments, either to its political platform or to its membership. Notably, the PLO’s gamble in 1993, based on the promise of the Oslo accords to deliver Palestinian statehood, has clearly failed. Yet the PLO still adheres to and stands on the same political platform as it did back then. Even more anomalous is the continued absence from the PLO of Palestinian factions, like Hamas, that from the very beginning opposed the “peace process”. Equally significant, the PLO’s platform has been steadily falling out of favour with the Palestinian public, who increasingly see it as irrelevant. It is time for Palestinians to adopt a new political platform, and to take concrete steps to bring non-PLO factions into the process. Membership of the PLO’s executive committee should also be expanded to include full and effective representation for political forces that don’t support or engage with its current approach. What principles should underpin the new platform? In short, it should commit itself to either of two (mutually exclusive) options. The first is a single state, with full equality for all citizens enshrined in the constitution, outlawing any discrimination on any basis whatsoever. The second is a negotiated two-state solution, but only with a fully sovereign Palestinian state on all of the territory occupied by Israel in 1967, including East Jerusalem. For this to work, the peace process would have to be preceded by recognition by Israel and the international community of the Palestinians’ right to such a state and, under international law, the right of return and to self-determination. At various junctures over the past decade, Hamas may have been open to considering such a scenario. Is it still a viable path forward? The only way to find out is not through yet another futile convening of a meeting of the heads of Palestinian factions that deals only in generalities and achieves little—as was the case when they last met a few months ago in Egypt—but rather by seeking to forge agreement among the factions, Hamas included, on such principles as those outlined above as a basis for achieving national unity. It has never been more important to find a way to end the division and fragmentation that has plagued the Palestinian polity since Hamas seized power in Gaza 16 years ago.■ Salam Fayyad is a former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority.

https://www.economist.com/leaders/2011/09/24/yes-to-palestinian-statehood,"THE Palestinians are edging closer to getting a recognised state, at least on paper. Their application to the UN's Security Council, pencilled in for September 23rd, will be rebuffed by an American veto. But if they then go to the UN General Assembly, which seems likely sooner or later, the Palestinians will win an overwhelming majority. The “observer” status that would be given to them would be similar to that of the Vatican—a position short of full membership, which can be conferred only by the Security Council. It would not make an immediate difference on the ground but would help the Palestinians on their way to the real thing by giving them a diplomatic fillip. It should be encouraged, for reasons of both principle and practice. The principle is simple: the Palestinians deserve a state, just as the Israelis do. The United States, the European Union and the Israeli government have all endorsed a two-state solution. There is broad agreement that the boundary should be based on the pre-1967 one, with land swaps allowing Israel to keep its biggest settlements close to the line, in return for the Palestinians gaining land elsewhere; Jerusalem should be shared; and the Palestinians should give up their claimed right of return to Israel proper. That still leaves much room for negotiation. But provided that the Palestinian request at the UN, still unfiled as The Economist went to press, does not undermine the basic terms of this deal, it is hard to see why any peacemaker, including America's Barack Obama, should oppose a proposal that nudges Palestine closer to real statehood (see article). The practical and procedural politics of the UN is trickier, but unless the last-minute negotiations deliver something dramatic, the arguments in favour of at least securing the Vatican option surely outweigh stasis. Israel's government, led by Binyamin Netanyahu, and his backers abroad, especially in the United States Congress, insist that Palestinian statehood is premature: instead of going to the UN, the Palestinians should return to the negotiating table without tiresome preconditions, such as demanding a freeze on the building of Jewish settlements. Mr Obama, keen to reassert his pro-Israel credentials before next year's election, seems likely to oppose even the Vatican option. Some congressmen are now preparing bills that would punish the Palestinians for their temerity. This is barmy. The argument that the Palestinians must resume negotiations before getting statehood is specious. Why on earth should a change in status at the UN stop people talking? Besides, the negotiations have been going nowhere—and Mr Netanyahu has been the biggest stumbling-block. Since his grudging acceptance two years ago of the two-state principle, Israel's prime minister has shown no eagerness or flexibility in his purported pursuit of a deal. Settlement-building on the West Bank, which he has refused to stop (barring a partial nine-month freeze), is no mere side issue; the Palestinians accurately liken it to the spectacle of two people negotiating over how to share a pizza while one of them continues to eat it. (Unlike the UN status, this does change things on the ground.) In his speech to Congress in May Mr Netanyahu refused to accept that Jerusalem, whose eastern Arab-populated part the Palestinians see as their capital, should be shared. He even inveighed against the notion that negotiations over the boundary should be on the basis of the pre-1967 line with swaps. The Palestinians have hardly been faultless. Mahmoud Abbas, their leader, has often dithered. He muffed a half-chance for a deal with Mr Netanyahu's predecessor, Ehud Olmert, three years ago. But he is the most peace-minded Palestinian leader the Israelis are likely to get. Were he now to back away from his UN bid, his clout among his own people would shrivel. The more extreme Palestinians, in particular the Islamists of Hamas, oppose the UN bid precisely because it would, if successful, strengthen the hand of their more flexible compatriots. If a UN resolution reaffirmed support for two states broadly along the 1967 border, those who reject Israel's existence, calling for a single state on all the land encompassing Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, would be wrong-footed. This is not to give Mr Abbas carte blanche. He should see whether the Europeans can produce anything (see Charlemagne). Assuming that his bid for full UN membership is blocked, he should rapidly revert to the Vatican option, along with a bevy of provisos to reassure the Israelis. He should agree to refrain from trying to arraign Israel in the International Criminal Court for its past actions. And at some point, Mr Abbas must admit to his people that most of the refugees will never return to Israel proper: that is the price of partition. A more secure Israel amid the Arab spring In truth, Israel will be safer when a proper Palestinian state has been consolidated. That is a point that too few Israelis and their American supporters appreciate. This newspaper has argued steadfastly for the right of Israel to exist. We abhor the creeping delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel. But we also believe that the Palestinians deserve a state of their own. These two beliefs are entirely compatible. By his intransigence Mr Netanyahu has played into the hands of those who would destroy Israel. In blocking any Palestinian aspirations at the UN, America is helping extremists on both sides."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/05/27/how-the-israeli-palestinian-peace-process-is-failing,"BY THE STANDARDS of the peace process, if not international law, Oranit is not a terribly contentious Jewish settlement. The Palestinians previously accepted that this hilly town of low-slung homes in the occupied West Bank would remain part of Israel in a future two-state solution. In one negotiating session their disagreements amounted to an area of about 400 square metres. It has grown into a commuter town, half an hour by motorway from Tel Aviv, and rates nine out of ten on Israel’s “socioeconomic index”, a measure of education, wealth and employment. Look east across the sun-baked hills and one sees Azzun Atmeh, an impoverished Palestinian village. No easy commutes for its residents: it is almost fully encircled by settlements and the imposing separation barrier. This is theoretically part of a future Palestine, but right now it is Israel, with most of its land designated as “Area C”, where Israel holds civil and military jurisdiction. The question of how to divide this land has been more or less answered, yet the parcelling out to two states has not come. Instead it remains under Israel’s control—a single state in which Jewish Israelis and West Bank Palestinians living a stone’s throw from each other hold very different rights and face very different prospects. Almost three decades have passed since Yasser Arafat, the late Palestinian leader, and Yitzhak Rabin, Israel’s prime minister at the time, shook hands on the White House lawn in 1993 after signing the Oslo accords. That hopeful moment cemented a formal peace process that would create a Palestinian state and end half a century of conflict. It was meant to happen within five years. Hope, alas, gave way to despair. It has now been more than five years since the parties even sat down to talk. Each time there is a bout of bloodletting between Israelis and Palestinians, it is de rigueur to urge them back to the negotiating table. But such rhetoric obscures why the peace process has failed. Decades of meetings produced a mountain of maps and policy papers. The outline of a two-state solution is well known to all. The problem with the peace process is not a lack of process, it is that process became a substitute for peace. To continue that process in hope of a breakthrough is to indulge a fantasy. It pretends that conditions on the ground—the steady growth of Israeli settlements, Israel’s ever-more entrenched control of Jerusalem, the schism between the West Bank and Gaza—are merely obstacles to negotiate around rather than insurmountable roadblocks. And it ignores shifts in politics and public opinion. Most Palestinians and a plurality of Israeli Jews oppose the two-state solution, as do two of the three governments between the river and the sea. It is time to admit the land-for-peace paradigm has failed. Moreover, it has often been unhelpful and counterproductive. The theoretical existence of a peace process gave Israel cover to entrench an occupation that looks permanent, and contributed to the rot in Palestinian politics. What exists today, and will exist for the foreseeable future, is really just one state. The Palestinian Authority (PA), the self-governing edifice set up after the Oslo accords, was meant to exist “for a transitional period not exceeding five years”. That deadline came and went, but the parties came close to a deal in 2000 at the Camp David summit, two weeks of sequestered talks between Ehud Barak, then the prime minister of Israel, and Mr Arafat. Conventional wisdom at the time blamed the latter for walking away; subsequent assessments offered a more muddled picture. Regardless, the failure at Camp David gave way to the brutal second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which soured many Israelis on making peace. Still, more negotiations followed: the “road map for peace”, the summits at Taba and Annapolis and Sharm el-Sheikh. For the past decade these efforts have been listless. Barack Obama’s two attempts at peacemaking lacked even memorable names. The second segued into a brutal 51-day war between Israel and Hamas, the violent Islamist group that rules Gaza. There have been no direct talks since 2014. Donald Trump’s “deal of the century” was a curious effort to solve the conflict without input from Palestinians. His successor, Joe Biden, seems disinclined even to try. He played at best a secondary role in broking a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel when they fought earlier this month. Then he dispatched Antony Blinken, his secretary of state, for a round of talks. The focus was to be aid for Gaza. The peace process was not on the agenda. In 1968 one of Mr Blinken’s predecessors, Dean Rusk, sent a sharp memo to the Israeli embassy in Washington. He noted reports that Israel was establishing civilian settlements in the newly occupied West Bank. This not only violated the Geneva Conventions, Mr Rusk wrote, but also “creates the strong appearance that Israel… does not intend to reach a settlement involving withdrawal from those areas”. Today more than 440,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements, a figure that has grown roughly fourfold since the Oslo accords were signed. The world has done nothing to halt their growth. Diplomats have accepted the fiction that the settlements are temporary, a claim belied by billions of shekels invested in homes and infrastructure over decades. Some settlers have now lived in the West Bank for two generations. Negotiators insist that big settlement “blocs”, which house about three-quarters of the settlers in the West Bank, are no obstacle to a peace deal. Yet one of the largest, Ariel, sits almost halfway across the width of the West Bank. The blocs carve ribbons and punch holes in the outline of a Palestinian state (see map). More than 100,000 Israelis live outside them, in isolated communities that would need to be evacuated—more than 12 times the number removed from Gaza during Israel’s disengagement from that territory in 2005. Settlers wield a level of political power today they did not hold back then. Five parties in the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) are ideologically committed to expanding settlements deep in the West Bank. Together they hold 56 seats, five shy of a majority. Even members of the Labour party have urged Israel to annex large chunks of the West Bank and end the fiction of “temporary” settlement. A poll conducted last year by the Israel Democracy Institute found that just 30% of Israelis opposed doing so. Mr Trump’s peace plan was widely mocked. But the map it offered, an archipelago of Palestinian territory connected by roads and tunnels and pockmarked with Israeli enclaves, was probably a realistic vision of how a peace agreement would look. (It still did not satisfy the settler movement, for which the very existence of a Palestinian state is anathema.) His plan did not offer even the pretence of a capital for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem, which they have long sought (the area is largely Palestinian). Instead they would house their future government in dismal suburbs on the far side of Israel’s concrete separation barrier. That too reflects current trends in Israeli politics. No big party accepts the city’s division. Jerusalem is now ringed with settlements, home to more than 200,000 Israelis, making it impossible to give the Palestinians a contiguous capital and difficult even to connect the northern and southern halves of the West Bank. Right-wing Israeli groups are using courts to try to expel Palestinians from their homes in Arab-majority neighbourhoods. The settler movement is not shy about its objectives. Each hill it claims in the West Bank, each home it seizes in East Jerusalem, makes it harder for Israel to cede the occupied territories in a final agreement with the Palestinians. The settlers’ spoiling is working, but they need not worry, anyway: there is no Palestinian leader to strike such a deal. Mahmoud Abbas has been president since 2005, serving an endless four-year term. Two-thirds of Palestinians are unhappy with his performance; 68% want him gone. Mr Abbas rules by decree, but he has no legitimacy to speak on behalf of Palestinians, half of whom are outside his remit anyway. The community in East Jerusalem feels adrift and leaderless, caught between the PA, which has no authority there, and the Israeli government, which most Palestinians are ineligible to vote for. The 2m in Gaza live under the rule of Hamas, which offers, at best, a lengthy truce with Israel. In Israel, meanwhile, the peace process is no longer a salient political issue. That is largely thanks to the long-serving prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. He tepidly endorsed a two-state solution in 2009, but has spent much of his career working to prevent it. Foreign diplomats often say the occupation is unsustainable. In the short term, Mr Netanyahu has proved them wrong. The security situation is fairly calm, the economy hummed before the pandemic and Israel’s diplomatic position is better than ever. Last year it established overt ties with four Arab states. With no pressure to resolve the conflict, most Israeli parties either oppose the two-state solution or ignore it. The Labour party, once the beating heart of Israel’s peace camp—it held a 44-seat plurality at the time of the Oslo accords—won just seven seats at the last election. A poll of Palestinians in March found that just 40% still support the two-state solution, down from 51% in 2016 and 56% in 2011. Support among Israeli Jews dropped from 53% in 2016 to 42% last year. Five years ago 82% of Israeli Arabs backed the idea; today 59% do. Yet Israelis and Palestinians are not sure what they do support (see chart). Some desire a single, binational state, others an apartheid state. There are Palestinians who hope to throw all the Jews into the sea and Jews who hope to throw all the Palestinians into Jordan. The most popular choice after a two-state solution is to believe there is presently no solution. It need not be a binary choice between one state and two. Some Israelis and Palestinians talk of a confederation that would split the difference. Both communities could fulfil their national aspirations, but with shared institutions and a porous border. Both Mr Abbas and Reuven Rivlin, the outgoing Israeli president, have expressed openness to such an arrangement. It would face obstacles, not least that it requires creating a system of governance that does not exist in the world today. A binational state would have to overcome a century of hostility. Such challenges are often cited as a reason to support the status quo: a two-state solution is desirable because the alternatives would be hard. After three decades of failed negotiations, though, this argument sounds hollow. In his final weeks as secretary of state, in 2016, John Kerry warned that Israel was heading for a permanent occupation, a reality he described as “separate but unequal”. His choice of words, a reference to Jim Crow in America, was meant to jolt listeners. Yet it was less a prediction of the future than a description of reality. The four groups of Palestinians in the Holy Land all face formal and practical discrimination compared with Israeli Jews. Start with Arab Israelis, as Israel calls them, or Palestinian citizens of Israel, as many (though not all) call themselves. They hold full citizenship, if not quite full rights. A “nation-state law” passed in 2018 reserved the right of “national self-determination” for Jews alone. The poverty rate for Arabs, 36%, is double that of Jews; their average monthly income in 2018 was 34% lower. The Supreme Court has upheld the right of small towns to screen residents for “social suitability”, a practice that has been used to bar Arabs from moving in. Palestinians in East Jerusalem exist in a sort of limbo. Most refuse to seek Israeli citizenship, waiting for a solution that never comes. They risk losing their Israeli residency cards if they leave the city; more than 14,000 have been revoked since 1967. A Palestinian born a few kilometres to the north, in Ramallah, cannot visit Jerusalem without a permit. Life in the West Bank is largely confined to the one-third of its territory under a measure of Palestinian control. Hundreds of checkpoints restrict freedom of movement. Then there is Gaza. To be born there, since 2007, is to be born in a place one cannot easily leave. Israel permits only select categories of Palestinians to cross its border, while Egypt allows only a few thousand travellers a month (and some months none at all). Almost half of Gazans are unemployed and 80% need help from aid groups to survive. These divisions occasionally collapse during times of trouble, as they did this May, when unrest in Jerusalem led to rocket fire from Gaza, riots inside Israel and protests in the West Bank. In quieter times, though, Palestinian leaders are happy to help perpetuate divisions among their people in order to preserve their fiefs. Several years ago your correspondent met Mahmoud Zahar, one of the founders of Hamas, in Gaza. In the West Bank, he said, Palestinians faced the routine threat of having their homes demolished by the Israeli army, often for failing to obtain building permits that are nigh impossible to get. Not so in Gaza: “Since Hamas took power,” he said, “there has not been a single house demolition.” That would come as a surprise to Palestinians who recently endured 11 days of conflict. The fighting displaced more than 70,000 people; some have no homes to return to. A longer war in 2014 left an estimated 17,000 families, more than 100,000 people, homeless. In fact, Mr Zahar was one of them: his home was destroyed by an Israeli air strike. Such is the emptiness of Hamas’s rhetoric. To the extent that it remains popular, that is largely in contrast to the superannuated Mr Abbas. At 85, he is old enough to remember a time before Israel existed; most of his constituents are not old enough to remember a time before he was president. The PA he oversees was meant to form the nucleus of a future state. With no state on offer, today it serves mostly to distribute public-sector salaries and conduct security co-ordination with Israel. America alone has provided more than $5bn in aid to the Palestinians since 1994. Many in the West Bank wonder where it went, as they drive on rutted roads and visit overcrowded hospitals. Close to a billion dollars is thought to have vanished during Mr Arafat’s rule. Today Mr Abbas is more interested in prosecuting anti-corruption activists than pursuing corruption. As long as his security forces keep the West Bank quiet, though, the world gives him a pass. The endurance of Hamas and Fatah, Mr Abbas’s party, is indicative of how the Oslo era warped Palestinian politics. Majorities in the West Bank and Gaza think their leaders corrupt and authoritarian. But Fatah enjoys a measure of international legitimacy because it accepts a territorial compromise that is now a mirage; Hamas claims popular legitimacy by rejecting compromise and promising liberation, which is just as illusory. To discard the land-for-peace framework would mean a sea change in Palestinian politics, reflecting a stark disjuncture between generations. Older people have spent a lifetime dreaming of an independent state. Asked why they do not abandon that dream and push for equality, they reply that Israel would never accept it. Many younger Palestinians disagree. The call for statehood, they argue, lets Israel frame the conflict as a struggle between two nations on a more or less equal footing. A battle for equal rights would put the onus more squarely on Israel. The two-state paradigm turned the conflict into a land dispute. If negotiators could simply find the right path for a border, the weary parties could retreat to their respective sides. But this is also a conflict over how two peoples should live together on an uncomfortably small patch of land. Some on both sides cling to fantasies. Right-wing Israelis persist in believing that the Palestinians can be persuaded to leave or be consigned to live as second-class non-citizens, a cheap labour pool content to cross teeming checkpoints each day to till fields and swing hammers. Groups such as Hamas still insist they can outlast Israel, that one day the Jews will pack up and “go back to Europe”, never mind that most of them are native-born (and often descended from Middle Eastern Jews rather than European Jews, to boot). Here and there in Israel one sees a phrase in graffiti on walls in Hebrew and Arabic: ain lanu eretz aheret; la watan lanna badeel. “We have no other country.” The Arabs and Jews must decide how to share it; the world cannot dictate a solution. That will require a new peace process, a genuine one, with legitimacy and popular support on both sides. It is hard to envision such a process sprouting soon from such poisoned soil. But to acknowledge reality would be a start. What came before has failed, and what comes next will need to talk less of partition and more of parity. ■"
https://www.economist.com/special/2000/05/25/for-palestine-bring-in-solomon,"THEY should by now be on the last lap of the six-year stop-go trundle to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. As it is, they are not even circling. After the latest violence in the West Bank, the Israelis called off all talks. Faith in the Oslo peace process (the agreement worked out in Oslo and signed in September 1993), let alone in its declared deadline of September 2000, is minimal. A year ago, the peace business seemed to have been galvanised by the election of Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister. America and the European Union still firmly believe in Mr Barak's reasonableness; consequently, the EU no longer supports the Palestinians as warmly as it did. Athough the prime minister is no peacenik—he has built more settlement units than his predecessor, and every peace move has had to be dragged out of him—he is thought to be a pragmatist and a man of decision. Would he could be. The elements of an eventual compromise have long been clear. What is needed now is for Mr Barak and Yasser Arafat, the two men at the top, to decide between themselves what the compromise should be, and then sell it to their people. Unfortunately, though both men are autocratically inclined, neither is in a strong position.  Mr Barak's coalition still has a 68-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, but it is fragile. Moreover, before he can make peace with either the Syrians or the Palestinians, he is committed to seeking the approval of the Israeli public through referendums. Public opinion polls show a small majority in favour of a Palestinian state. But they also show that the prime minister's own standing is remarkably low.  On the Palestinian side, Mr Arafat, an old revolutionary leader turned one-man-band politician, is also unpopular with his own people. Though he does not have to worry about democratic party politics, his administration is damned for corruption, mismanagement and much else besides. The Palestinian diaspora has always been deeply sceptical of the Oslo peace process, believing that it betrays their profoundest hopes. But by now West Bankers and Gazans are almost equally disenchanted. Their standard of living has deteriorated since 1993: income per person is down by about one-fifth, unemployment has risen sharply, and freedom of movement is a myth. It takes longer to get to Gaza than to New York, says a disgruntled West Banker.  Above all, Palestinians are afraid that Mr Arafat might be tempted to relinquish what they see as their basic rights in return for a deeply flawed, and possibly temporary, peace. There is a great turning back to first principles, with little appetite for compromise. The fact that Lebanon has got all its Israeli-occupied land back—and got it by force—encourages the Palestinians to question why they should be asked to settle for less. As Mr Arafat's increasingly inflexible people point out, a return to the 1967 line would still mean a Palestinian state on only 22% of the Palestine covered by the British mandate. They want Mr Arafat to insist on 100% of the 22%, not accept the 70-80% he is likely to be offered. And they are demanding, just as unrealistically, that the new state should be founded on the principle that East Jerusalem is its sovereign capital and that the refugees who were forced out of Israel in 1948 have the right to return. With grandstanding on both sides, a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian settlement, covering everything, is virtually unobtainable. If any practical result is to be had, aims, and voices, have to be lowered. But achieving lower aims will be difficult, too. Mr Barak's strategy is to try for two agreements. The first would be the “framework agreement”, which missed its second deadline on May 13th. The second would be the permanent deal that is set for September, but is almost certain to slip. This two-stage process—guidelines first, details later—copies the model of the Camp David agreement with Egypt in 1978, which was followed the next year by the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. But the devil this time is in the guidelines, not the details.  Israel's latest idea, or so it now seems, is that the framework agreement would not try to set out agreed principles, except vaguely, but would concentrate on the outlines of a Palestinian state. It would consider what the borders of such a state should be, and deal with the closely related subjects of Jewish settlements and establishing Israel's own security. The other “final-status” issues—Jerusalem, refugees and water—would be left to the next stage. The toughest questions of all—Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the refugees' right of return—would be postponed indefinitely. It is not that the border and settlement questions are simple; but they are a priority. Until these problems are sorted out, there can be no movement towards a separate Palestinian entity. Moreover, if they are not resolved, the Palestinians will insist, as is their right under the interim agreements, on another Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in advance of a permanent agreement. Even worse for Israel, Mr Arafat might be tempted to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally. The current map of the West Bank is madness. Under the five-year interim agreement, the Israelis have grudgingly been handing back slices of territory: either to full Palestinian control, or to Palestinian administrative authority while Israel keeps security control. The Palestinians currently control, fully or partially, some 40% of the West Bank. The amount of land handed over, and where it was, was entirely up to Israel to decide.   The result is a crazy hotchpotch of Palestinian-controlled towns and villages (see map), each patch divided from the next by Israeli-held territory. Arab villages are overlooked by settlements; some are split in half by roads. In Hebron and East Jerusalem, Israelis have settled themselves at the centre of Arab living areas. Although the bulk of the settlers in the West Bank are there for convenience, subsidised housing, space and air, quite a few went, or were sent, expressly to make it difficult to return the land.   Mr Barak seems ready, as his predecessor was not, to offer the Palestinians more contiguous blocks of land. Current Israeli thinking suggests two blocks in the West Bank: one in the north and one in the south, split by an Israeli corridor. Shimon Peres, a former prime minister not much liked by the current one, is said to have been set the job of devising a way of linking the two.  But the envisaged area would still be tiny. As well as allowing for natural increase—Palestinian numbers are now growing much faster than Israel's—the 3m or so Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are expected to be joined by a fair number of the 2.3m refugees now in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The new state would be squeezed between a wavy strip of Israeli-annexed land to the west (containing most of the Israeli settlements, with a finger stretching as far as Ariel, Israel's second-largest settlement) and a possible buffer zone of undecided width to the east, which would quarantine the Palestinian state from Jordan. Despite its good relations with its eastern neighbour, Israel remains fearful of a regional war and is determined to keep at least part of the Jordan valley in its own hands.  It has been calculated that if Israel annexes something less than 10% of the West Bank it can still accommodate more than 80% of the 170,000 or so Israeli settlers (this excludes the roughly similar number of settlers in occupied East Jerusalem). The remaining settlers would either be rehoused or continue where they are under Palestinian rule. Mr Barak's government wants to annex or keep more land than that. A proposal by Haim Ramon, a cabinet member, suggests that 10% of the West Bank (containing most of the settlements) should be annexed by Israel; 70% should go directly to the Palestinians; and another 20%, which would include a wide strip of the Jordan valley, should be leased to Israel for an undetermined period. Although these percentages are unacceptable to the other side, the formula of leasing controversial patches of land could contain the elements of an eventual compromise. Jerusalem, holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, arouses passionate emotion. Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967; in 1980 a basic law declared the city its “eternal, undivided capital”. Israelis are united in insisting on this. But the annexation is unrecognised by the rest of the world and, as a result, all countries, save for Costa Rica and El Salvador, keep their embassies in Tel Aviv. Israel craves the legitimacy of recognition. Nobody wants to divide Jerusalem again, or to resurrect the ugly dividing line that scarred the city between 1948 and 1967. But the city—its stones, its history and its symbolism no less than its holy places—means as much to the Palestinians as it does to the Israelis. It is part of their collective memory, and they are determined to see it as their capital, drawing the separate blocks of their putative state together into a more homogeneous whole. Few Israelis will contemplate diluting the principle of exclusive Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem. But even fewer ever venture into the cluster of Arab districts and villages that, together with the post-1967 Israeli settlements, make up East Jerusalem. Despite the settlements that ring the Arab city, forming a cordon sanitaire between it and the West Bank, the place still feels like two cities. Recognising this, many people have suggested compromises that would give the Israelis and Palestinians administrative control of their own areas, while an umbrella body dealt with joint concerns. The end-game in most of these proposals is that the undivided city should be capital to both states. If the Palestinians are to be persuaded to defer a decision on their sovereignty, they would have to be satisfied about the degree of municipal authority they are given, including the intensely sensitive issues of zoning and residency rights in East Jerusalem. They would also look for an Israeli commitment to stop, or go slow on, settlement expansion. But there are no signs, at present, that Israel is ready to grant this.  More than 800,000-900,000 Palestinians fled from Israel during its war of independence. Resolutions at the UN General Assembly called for their right of return and for compensation. But the refugees, who now number around 3m, were offered neither. Israel acknowledged no responsibility, and it suited the Arab world to preserve them as a visible sign of the injustice of Israel's creation. Jordan alone gave them citizenship. A UN agency was set up to keep them alive, but many still live in their original camps or shanty towns. Mr Arafat, if he is not to be charged with betraying these dispossessed people, has to try to get Israel to acknowledge their right to return—even if only on paper. But Israel, though not all Israeli historians, still refuses to accept responsibility for the Palestinians' flight. This, explains one senior politician, would be tantamount to admitting that the Israeli state had been born in sin. There is no room for compromise between these irreconcilable principles—which makes it almost certain that, despite Palestinian protestations, the principle of “right of return” will be deferred. But this does not mean that nothing practical can be done in the meantime. International money would be an excellent beginning, allowing the UN, with the richer world behind it, to start looking into compensation for those who can, or want to, stay in their host countries. And the new Palestinian state could be helped to absorb those who want to make the West Bank their permanent home. Israel, too, might well be willing to absorb a limited number, so long as it was plain that it did so voluntarily, for humanitarian reasons. In particular, Israel could come to the rescue of the worst-off refugees of all, the Palestinians in Lebanon, who, because they upset the country's religious balance, are allowed only minimal rights. Since many of them came originally from Galilee, the return of some of them to Arab villages in the region would not rock the Israeli state.  In all this, one fundamental question has barely been touched on in the negotiations for a permanent settlement. That is water, and its vital importance in a parched region. “I can wait to pray at al-Aqsa mosque [in Jerusalem] but I can't wait for a clean glass of water,” says a Palestinian official. The current distribution of available water is grossly unjust. The Palestinians' use per person, in towns and for farming, is only 30% of the Israelis'. The settlers, profligate with irrigation, consume five or six times as much per person as their Palestinian neighbours. The Israelis use waste water for a lot of their farming; the Palestinians are only now being allowed to set up water-treatment plants, and still under conditions they find unacceptable. When it comes to drinking, 37% of West Bankers are without piped water, and the Gazans drink water that is hardly fit for fields. The answer, argue Israelis, lies in increasing resources, not in redistribution. They look, with hope, to desalination. This is a good answer for a country that has money, technical prowess and a long coastline. But it is not the answer for Gaza, which is broke, has no energy sources and where the pipe leakage is something like 60%, let alone for the inland West Bank. A fair solution would be to bring the quantity and quality of Palestinian drinking water up to Israeli standards, and then negotiate on irrigation water. Both Israel and the Palestinian territories would benefit from a change in farming habits towards less thirsty crops. But nothing like that is close to being discussed. Israel's agricultural lobby is greedy and powerful; Gazans would be aghast at giving up citrus or flowers.  Israel controls the use of all the surface water from the Jordan and virtually all the ground water from the aquifers that criss-cross the West Bank (see map). Its version of the future border between itself and a Palestinian state is partly dictated by its determination to keep as much control as it can. The Palestinians have not, as yet, seriously challenged this. They will, when the issue of water creeps up the agenda.  How can it be, after so much negotiation, over so many years, that the two sides are still so far apart on basic issues? From the beginning it was known where the talks would eventually head. Yet they still sound much as they did at the start.  The back-channel talks in Stockholm that were called off last weekend will presumably get going again, perhaps plotting a way past those irreconcilable principles. Look how the Oslo back-channel took everybody by surprise and delight in 1993, breaking a log-jam, delivering peace and Nobel prize-winners, and setting the current negotiations in train. But look again. It was Oslo's ambiguity, and lack of substance, that helped to cause the present disenchantment. What is needed now are decisions, not clever, ambiguous formulae. Mr Barak and Mr Arafat alone have the power to deliver such decisions, and the authority to persuade their people to accept them. The question is whether they are ready to do so."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/11/the-palestinian-authority-is-being-eclipsed-by-radical-militants,"The Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover, which coincide this year, ought to be a time when two of the three Abrahamic religions reflect on their common beliefs and shared destiny in the Holy Land. Instead, the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is at risk of a dangerous escalation. In just five days from April 5th Israel was hit by rockets launched from Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. The ostensible trigger was clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police forces who had entered the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites. Videos showed police beating people inside the mosque, while young Palestinians shot fireworks at them. In all this, one actor is noticeably absent: the Palestinian Authority (PA), which was set up under the Oslo accords almost 30 years ago as an interim administration to lead the Palestinians into statehood. Now the body headed by Mahmoud Abbas, 87, is becoming irrelevant as the last vestige of a moribund peace process. Undemocratic, ineffectual and mired in corruption, it is losing touch with Palestinians. This was laid bare last year when Palestinian security forces arrested Musaab Shtayyeh, a low-level Hamas financier, in the West Bank city of Nablus. The arrest sparked a day of violence in Nablus, as local armed groups rioted, demanding his release from Palestinian custody. They clashed, not with Israeli soldiers, but with Palestinian security forces. From the outset the PA’s legitimacy rested on it being a partner in a peace process that was meant to create a Palestinian state alongside a Jewish one. But with talks frozen for decades, the PA faces an existential crisis. A study last month by a leading Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shikaki, found for the first time that a majority of Palestinians (52%) said the PA’s collapse or dissolution was in their interest. There are several reasons why Palestinians are losing faith in the PA, but a key one is that it looks hapless in response to the continued construction of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory. Moreover, the PA has also been unable to protect Palestinians from violence inflicted on them by Israeli settlers, who rampage from time to time through Palestinian towns and fields, beating people and destroying their orchards and vines. This violence has only increased since Binyamin Netanyahu returned to office as Israel’s prime minister in December with the backing of right-wing parties, including those led by Jewish supremacists. The PA’s authority is further undermined when Israel carries out bloody raids in Area A, which largely comprises Palestinian cities under the control of the Palestinian security forces. Since the collapse of the peace process, many Palestinians have begun to reconcile themselves to the PA morphing from the harbinger of an independent state into something of a glorified municipality that merely provides basic services. Now it is failing even in that role. Public services are paralysed by strikes over unpaid wages. Schools in the West Bank have barely been running since 20,000 teachers went on strike in early February. Hospitals are short of key medicines. “The PA cannot honour its obligations,” says Raja Al Khalidi of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute in Ramallah, the Palestinians’ administrative capital. “That’s a form of collapse [even if] it’s not a physical collapse.” Prickly Palestinian officials argue that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank makes it almost impossible for them to govern. They are also short of cash, not least because Israel has withheld some 4bn shekels ($1.1bn) in customs revenues that it collects on the PA’s behalf. Israel says this is because the PA is not keeping its side of the deal by maintaining security. It is also furious that the PA makes payments to the families of those killed carrying out attacks on Israelis, many of them civilians. Yet the issue goes beyond money. “It’s not just about salaries,” says Youssef Joha, a leader of the teachers’ strike. “There’s an issue of trust with the PA.” The PA’s budget troubles and crumbling administrative capacity are affecting its security services too. A senior officer says at any time some 2,500 of the force’s 83,000 members fail to turn up because they are supplementing their salaries with jobs in construction or hospitality in Israel. This is because a major-general in the Palestinian security forces has a salary of just 12,160 shekels a month, while a private would get just 1,900 shekels. By contrast, a Palestinian doing manual labour in Israel can earn at least 6,000 shekels a month. In recent months the PA has largely lost control of security in the West Bank’s main cities such as Jenin and Nablus, where armed groups have emerged, such as the Lions’ Den. These are thought to be responsible for attacks against Israeli targets in the West Bank, including against civilians. Though the PA has come under international pressure to regain control of Nablus and Jenin, it is in a bind. If it sends in the troops, as it did last year in the case of Mr Shtayyeh, it will be further delegitimised in the eyes of Palestinians. Yet if it holds back, Israeli forces are more likely to intervene, often with deadly results. Its crisis of legitimacy is not helped by its undemocratic ways. The last time Palestinians got to vote for members of the legislative council was in 2006. Mr Abbas, who was elected president in 2005, is in the 19th year of a four-year term. He shows no desire to leave his presidential palace, which polls suggest would happen if he were to put his name on the ballot. In 2021 Mr Abbas cancelled legislative elections after polls indicated his Fatah party faced defeat. Many Palestinians glumly accept that there will be no elections until he dies. International donors are frustrated by the PA’s lack of democracy, transparency and legitimacy. “There has been a tightening of the screws,” says a European diplomat, noting that foreign aid increasingly goes to NGOs or directly to hospitals. “We barely deal with the PA any more.” Most older Palestinians oppose the resumption of an armed struggle because they do not want a repeat of the second intifada, or uprising, which claimed more than 3,000 Palestinian and 1,000 Israeli lives between 2000 and 2005. Yet attitudes are changing. A poll issued last month by Mr Shikaki found that 54% of Palestinians thought violence was the best way to end Israel’s occupation; 68% favoured forming armed groups such as the Lions’ Den, which the PA does not control. Mr Abbas and the PA must shoulder much of the blame for the authority’s predicament. But Israel, which relies a great deal on its co-operation in security, has done much to weaken the PA. Were it to disintegrate further, it would leave a vacuum that would probably be filled by violent factions that have given up entirely on the peace process. As deeply flawed as the PA is, many may come to rue its passing. ■"
https://www.economist.com/news/2006/02/21/the-new-face-of-palestine," FOR those who could bear to sit through it, the swearing-in of the new Palestinian legislature on Saturday February 18th told the story of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its current woes in microcosm. Israel would not let Hamas lawmakers from Gaza travel to the West Bank for the session, so they had to join in via a video link that emitted alarming echoes and periodically crashed. A speech by one of the defeated Fatah party's elder statesmen, Salim Zanoun, turned into a rambling rant that had some Fatah members shouting at him while others clutched their heads in shame at this valedictory demonstration of their party's ineptness.  Then, Mahmoud Abbas, the PA's president (also a Fatah man), who pointedly got up to take a break during Mr Zanoun's speech, gave his own address in which he exhorted Hamas to abandon violence and follow the path of negotiations with Israel. Hamas legislators listened respectfully but coldly. There was only one candidate for speaker—Hamas's Aziz Dweik—but his election was conducted with laborious attention to procedural detail while Fatah members (who had fielded nobody to avoid the indignity of losing yet again) defiantly turned in blank ballot papers. And the foreign diplomatic corps, which had turned out in force for Mr Abbas's speech, exited en masse afterwards, to avoid being present for Hamas's first official act. Isolated and hemmed in on all sides, Hamas now has to form a government. On Tuesday its nominee for prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, met Mr Abbas and received his letter of accreditation, giving him five weeks to put together a government. The new Palestinian prime minister is a legislator from Gaza who led his party's national list and who is described variously as a pragmatist and a relative moderate, in Hamas terms. This week Hamas began talks with other Palestinian factions, including armed militant groups, to see if they will join it in a national-unity government. On Monday Islamic Jihad, which has continued to stage attacks in Israel despite a tentative ceasefire by other militant groups, said it would not join. The same day, the group's military commander in the West Bank was shot dead by Israeli troops in Nablus.  Hamas would like to bring Fatah people into its government too. Mr Abbas said on Monday that his party might join under certain conditions. But Fatah is divided and the inclination among most of its members is to let Hamas run things and make its own mistakes. If it cannot get others to join it, Hamas says, it will appoint non-political technocrats to the key ministries. But there are few hints as to who those might be. Whoever is chosen for the new cabinet, it is unlikely to appease Hamas's main enemies. With Israeli elections due on March 28th, there is great pressure on Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister and heir apparent to Ariel Sharon, to take a tough line. Israel followed the inauguration of the legislature by announcing that it would, as planned, start treating the PA as a terrorist entity. It will cut off the revenues that it collects on the PA's behalf and is supposed to transfer to it under an economic agreement signed in the 1990s, and will continue to restrict Hamas legislators' movements, even within the West Bank (some had to slip around checkpoints to get to the opening session). The United States, where a proposed bill would effectively impose a blanket ban on contacts and funding to the PA, is putting the squeeze on Hamas too. While Hamas leaders have been travelling around the Middle East drumming up funds, the American secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has embarked on her own tour of the region to persuade Arab governments to withhold all but humanitarian aid. America is also asking the PA to give back $50m of unspent money that had been slated for infrastructure projects. European donors remain divided, but it is likely that they will have to scale back at least some funding. With all this, a fiscal crisis is going to bite soon. The PA paid its salaries some ten days late this month, after Israel decided to make one last revenue transfer. There is no knowing when the pay packets due on March 1st will arrive. Since the PA's 137,000 staff are estimated to support around a third of the Palestinian population with their wages, the West's sanctions will be keenly felt. Palestinians are worried about their prospects—but after Fatah's dismal failure in everything from running basic services to negotiating peace, they are not about to run back to it. If anything, the outside pressure on Hamas could strengthen solidarity with it. And the funding squeeze may not be particularly effective either. Even if the West cuts off its own aid and persuades the more compliant Middle Eastern governments to do the same—which would further inflame an already angry Arab street across the region—there are many informal networks, through Islamic charities in various countries, business people, or smugglers, that could let cash trickle through.  Furthermore, if Hamas succeeds in cutting the corruption and inefficiency in the PA, which has thousands of fictitious employees on the books, it may find that it can get by with considerably less than before. If so, that could make for a PA that is both leaner and meaner, and perhaps even less inclined to meet the West's demands—to recognise Israel and renounce violence—than Hamas is now."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2016/06/02/a-museum-without-exhibits,"THE Palestinians’ new national museum is a striking monument to the state they don’t yet have. Designed by a firm in Dublin, the museum itself is angular and modern, with glass curtain walls topped by smooth white limestone. From afar it looks almost like a low-slung bunker perched on a hill north of Ramallah; inside, though, it is light and airy. A terraced garden stretches out below, filled with dozens of local species: almond and fig trees, mint and za’atar. Only one thing is missing—the exhibits. When the first visitors arrive in June, they will tour an empty building. The curators had spent years planning an inaugural exhibition, “Never Part”, about the personal effects that Palestinian refugees took when they fled their homes. But the museum’s director, Jack Persekian, resigned in December, citing “disagreements” with management, and the show was postponed. The saga of the $24m museum feels like a microcosm of Palestine’s broader problems. The idea of building it was first conceived in 1997, but the plans were soon suspended amid the violence of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising. The organisers did not break ground until 2013, and the project, which they aimed to complete within a year, was plagued by a series of cost overruns and delays. The museum blames many of those on Israel, which controls the border between Jordan and the occupied West Bank. The Austrian-made emergency-exit signs were inexplicably delayed by Israeli customs authorities; so were light fixtures from Germany. The Jordanian landscaper, meanwhile, has not been able to get a visa, so he supervises the grounds via video chat. These are common complaints among developers in the area. Bashar al-Masri, a wealthy businessman who is building Palestine’s first planned city, keeps six months of inventory on hand to cope with the inevitable delays at the border. The need for vast warehouses, filled with everything from cement to marble, adds to the cost and the logistical challenges. The museum is run by a private organisation, which at least spares it from the West Bank’s incessant political feuding. Mahmoud Abbas, the unpopular president, is in the 11th year of a four-year term, and is increasingly paranoid about his grip on power. Last year he sacked Yasser Abed Rabbo, a vocal critic who was, in effect, the number-two man in the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In an added fit of pique, Mr Abbas also booted him from his job as director of the Mahmoud Darwish Foundation, which runs a museum dedicated to Palestine’s national poet. Over the past decade the Palestinians have built many of the trappings of a state: a police force, a central bank. At the inauguration ceremony on May 18th, Mr Abbas called the museum another important step. “The only thing left is declaring independence, which you will all declare soon,” he said. Yet the peace process is comatose, Israel’s government is unyielding and the Palestinians are hopelessly divided between Mr Abbas and the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza. Few believe him—including, it seems, the museum’s directors. Without an independent state, the 1.8m people in Gaza cannot visit, nor can the 3m refugees who live in neighbouring countries. So the curators are planning a series of satellite shows. The first exhibition in Palestine’s national museum, about the history of local embroidery, will be in Beirut."
https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/28/the-culture-war-over-the-gaza-war,"The imagery is enticing, the rhythm and rhyme are propulsive. “From the river to the sea,” runs the popular slogan, “Palestine will be free!” In recent days that couplet has resounded in squares from Toronto to Berlin. Wearing chequered keffiyeh scarves, Californian pupils declaimed it as they swept down school corridors. Activists projected the words onto a wall of a university in Washington, DC. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas What do they mean? Superficially an idealistic vow of liberation, the decades-old expression also contains a threat: the river is the River Jordan, the sea is the Mediterranean and freedom, in this case, implies the destruction of the state of Israel. That is certainly the sense in which Hamas uses the phrase. The children chanting it at the base of Nelson’s column in London on October 21st, during a big pro-Palestinian march, may not have grasped the menace. But several marchers who were yelling the words, or bearing them on placards, seemed aware of it, clamming up defensively when asked to explain them. “Anyone who’s paying attention knows exactly what that means,” says Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League, an American anti-hate group which, like watchdogs in Britain and elsewhere, has documented a steep rise in antisemitic incidents since Hamas’s bloody raid on Israel on October 7th. (Islamophobic incidents have multiplied in several countries, too.) The ubiquity of this deceptively hardline mantra points up an important shift in Western attitudes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Three related forces are driving it: technology, demography and ideology. The Western left once sympathised with Zionism. That changed markedly after the six-day war of 1967 and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Especially since the end of apartheid in South Africa, the Palestinian cause has been a talismanic issue for left-leaning Westerners. Why it acquired this status is a matter of debate. In some analyses, Israel serves as an avatar for American power, or for bygone colonial struggles. Jewish groups and others have wondered why the casualties in, say, Syria or Afghanistan—where the perpetrators as well as the victims are Muslim—stir less bien-pensant concern. After a period in which the issue receded in prominence in Western diplomacy and headlines, Gaza’s plight is now inspiring protests and disputes as never before. A glut of open letters by artists and other luminaries have decried Israel’s bombardment and Western leaders’ acquiescence to it. (Counter-petitions mourn the atrocities of October 7th and affirm Israel’s right to self-defence.) Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held in many cities, including some where they were notionally banned. The recriminations flow both ways. In Britain the BBC’s reluctance to refer to Hamas as “terrorists” led to an outcry and a partial climbdown. Dave Chappelle, an American comedian, reportedly had a spat with punters at a gig in Boston after he lamented the crisis in Gaza. Some American students have been hounded for their stridently anti-Israel views; talks by Palestinian authors have been cancelled. Palestine Legal, which supports pro-Palestinian activists in America, says they are “facing a wave of McCarthyite backlash targeting their livelihoods and careers”. “Silence is violence”, runs another popular protest slogan, a position taken by some on all sides. A range of institutions, from universities to unions, have been berated for the wording of their public statements, or for failing to issue one. Calls for peace have been likened to appeasement. And supporters of both Israel and the Palestinians make analogies with Ukraine to show the supposed hypocrisy of the opposing camp. Backers of the Palestinians see Gaza as the victim (like Ukraine) of invasion by a bullying neighbour. Pro-Israelis point to Hamas’s incursion and liken its barbarity to Russian war crimes. The polarised passions and viral slogans are in part a sharp manifestation of the echo-chamber effect of social media. Millions of people have watched footage of Hamas’s depredations in horror. Many others are transfixed instead by images of Gaza’s agony. In Germany, for instance, where a synagogue has been firebombed and Stars of David daubed on Jewish homes, some Islamists exist in “parallel societies”, relying on digital and overseas news, says Felix Klein, the federal commissioner for antisemitism. So, he adds, do many on the far right, which commits most of the country’s antisemitic crimes. (There, as in America, the two groups have made common cause online.) Worse, the heart-rending clips and pictures sometimes come from the wrong country or the wrong war, or even from video games. Like the echo-chamber effect, online disinformation is a familiar problem that has seemed as acute as ever in the ongoing crisis.  The blast at the Ahli Arab hospital on October 17th was a supreme example of the reach and clout of falsehoods. Swiftly picked up by major news outfits, misleading reports contributed, in short order, to the cancelling of a summit between Arab leaders and President Joe Biden. Demand for disinformation, reckons Peter Pomerantsev of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is an even bigger problem than supply. In wartime, “people are looking for reasons to confirm their biases,” he says glumly. “It isn’t about the facts.” Screen habits encourage another striking feature of reactions to the war: the “gamification” of news, whereby irony and taboo-busting are prized, even amid the gravest calamities. The paragliders on which some Hamas murderers flew to Israel were, for a few onlookers, irresistibly meme-worthy. Black Lives Matter Chicago briefly posted an image of a paraglider with the words, “I stand with Palestine.” “From Chicago to Gaza,” runs another of its messages, “from the river to the sea.” As for demography: immigration is one factor skewing the culture war in the West over the tragic one in the Middle East. Muslim populations in Western countries are both growing and changing in composition. In the past, notes Yunus Ulusoy of the Centre for Turkish Studies and Integration Research in Essen, the Muslim population in Germany was of predominantly Turkish origin. Now, he says, around 2.1m Muslims in the country have roots in Syria, Iraq and other places that are hostile to Israel. They brought their views of the conflict with them—shaped, says Mr Ulusoy, by a sense of solidarity with the ummah, or global Muslim community. Awareness of Nazism and the Holocaust, which for decades coloured German attitudes to Israel and antisemitism, is waning. Some Muslims, says Professor Julia Bernstein of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, think this awful past “is not our history”, and that they are now the real victims of prejudice in Germany. France, notes Dominique Moïsi, an eminent French commentator, is home to both the largest Muslim population in western Europe and the biggest Jewish one. It has a traumatic recent history of Islamist terrorism, and a more distant one of collaboration with the Nazis, both of which tend to bolster support for Israel. But it also harbours contrary strains of anti-Americanism and guilt over French colonialism in the Arab world. The result, says Mr Moïsi, is a “conflict of memories” that plays out in politics and on the streets. In America, the most influential depiction of Israel in popular culture is probably “Exodus”. A novel by Leon Uris published in 1958, it dramatises the birth of the state and became a film starring Paul Newman. (“As a piece of propaganda,” said David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, “Exodus” was “the greatest thing ever written” about the country.) Overall, Americans remain much more supportive of Israel than are Europeans. Polls conducted since October 7th show a hardening of support for it among Democrats in particular. But there is an important demographic wrinkle. As Tim Malloy, a polling analyst at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, says, younger Americans are much less inclined to back Israel than are their elders. They also think more favourably of the Palestinian people. According to surveys by Pew, this gap in sympathy between American generations is widening (see chart). Many young voters do not have direct memories of the attacks of September 11th 2001, a calamity which shaped older Americans’ views of Islamist terrorists such as Hamas. Their diverging outlook also reflects the third force swaying Western attitudes: a binary ideology that emerged from American universities to win converts far and wide. Seeing the world in Manichean terms can be comforting. It turns confounding issues into simple clashes of good and evil, conferring a halo of virtue on those who pick the right side. As Yascha Mounk, author of “The Identity Trap”, argues, the emerging ideology offers just this form of comfort, sorting the world into opposing categories—coloniser and colonised, oppressors and oppressed—often along racial lines. In essence it transposes the terms of American debates over race onto other places and problems. “The American brand of anti-colonialism”, quips Mr Mounk, “is astonishingly colonialist.” In a polarised age, lots of people infer their opinions from their political allegiance rather than the other way round. This, thinks Mr Mounk, is part of the new ideology’s appeal: it furnishes an all-purpose vocabulary to apply to any conflict. In this schema, the powerless can do no wrong, least of all to the powerful—and nobody can be both. Liberation movements of all kinds are linked, as communist insurgencies purported to be during the cold war. As flares in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off at Piccadilly Circus, a protester in London holding a “Queers for Palestine” sign explained that “All the struggles are connected.” This philosophy is tailor-made for the posturing and character-limits of social-media posts, perhaps one reason it is gaining adherents. But it prohibits the balance and nuanced judgments that intractable real-world hostilities demand. In particular, because the Palestinians are cast as powerless, and Israel is classed as powerful, it follows that Israelis cannot qualify as victims. Never mind the exile of Mizrahi Jews from Arab countries to Israel. The Holocaust is ancient history. The schema shows up glaringly in references to Hamas’s crimes as a form of “resistance” or “decolonisation”, and in the statement by some Harvard students that held Israel “entirely responsible” for the slaughter of its own citizens. Many Jews, in Israel and the diaspora, perceive a wider disregard for Israel’s suffering—not just less sympathy than it received during, say, the Entebbe hostage crisis of 1976, but a void. If the issue is morally simple, meanwhile, for many Western activists the remedy is blunt and drastic: not the two-state solution of yore, but a Palestine that stretches “from the river to the sea”. In the left-leaning political elite, the picture is starkly different. Both Mr Biden and Sir Keir Starmer, leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, have offered Israel staunch support. All the same, the escalation in some rank-and-file attitudes to the war may have a lasting fallout—both in the Middle East and in the West. Mr Biden, Sir Keir and other leaders have been lambasted by some in their parties for declining to call for a ceasefire. This disapproval—often motivated by natural compassion for Palestinian civilians rather than ideology—may cost them votes, Muslim and otherwise, in what may be tight elections next year. (Mr Biden may have weighed that risk against the potentially higher cost of supporting a ceasefire.) That may not be the only form of political blowback. Plenty of liberal voters are dismayed by the responses of people with whom, in the past, they felt broadly aligned. Their coalition with more radical voters was already under pressure; for some liberals, the bedrock of common values that they thought underpinned it seems to have crumbled. If the debate over Gaza has been a symptom of polarisation in the West, it may yet prove to be a cause of realignment, too. The consequences for Israel and the Middle East are unpredictable. At least in the short term, revulsion for Hamas seems to outweigh any qualms Americans might have had before the war over Israel’s rightward lurch under Binyamin Netanyahu. Most Americans, including most Democrats, tell pollsters that supporting Israel is in American interests. How far and how long that remains the case depends on a series of unknowns—starting with the conduct and outcome of the ground invasion of Gaza, and the new dispensation that may follow. Developments in domestic politics will matter, including the fervour of the Republican embrace of isolationism. From an Israeli point of view, though, the long-term trajectory of opinion in America is worrying. And in Europe, as the second world war recedes from living memory and the clout of Muslim voters grows, support for Israel may continue to soften, especially on the left. Even as the disaster in Israel and Gaza unfolds, one of its morals is already clear. Amid the unchecked flow of images and ideas, Western public opinion and geopolitical conflicts are entangled in new and explosive ways. Culture wars and real wars are no longer separate struggles. ■"
https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2011/05/17/here-comes-your-non-violent-resistance,"FOR many years now, we've heard American commentators bemoan the violence of the Palestinian national movement. If only Palestinians had learned the lessons of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, we hear, they'd have had their state long ago. Surely no Israeli government would have violently suppressed a non-violent Palestinian movement of national liberation seeking only the universally recognised right of self-determination. Palestinian commentators and organisers, including Fadi Elsalameen and Moustafa Barghouthi, have spent the last couple of years pointing out that these complaints resolutely ignore the actual and growing Palestinian non-violent resistance movement. For that matter, they elide the fact that the first intifada, which broke out in 1987, was initially as close to non-violent as could be reasonably expected. For the most part, it consisted of general strikes and protest marches. In addition, there was a fair amount of kids throwing rocks, as well as the continuing threat of low-level terrorism, mainly from organisations based abroad; the Israelis conflated the autochthonous protest movement with the terrorism and responded brutally, and the intifada quickly lost its non-violent character. That's not that different from what has happened over the past couple of months in Libya; it shows that it's very hard to keep a non-violent movement non-violent when the government you're demonstrating against subjects you to gunfire for a sustained period of time. In any case, if you're among those who have made the argument that Israelis would give Palestinians a state if only the Palestinians would learn to employ Ghandhian tactics of non-violent protest, it appears your moment of truth has arrived. As my colleague writes, what happened on Nakba Day was Israel's ""nightmare scenario: masses of Palestinians marching, unarmed, towards the borders of the Jewish state, demanding the redress of their decades-old national grievance."" Peter Beinart writes that this represents ""Israel's Palestinian Arab Spring"": the tactics of mass non-violent protest that brought down the governments of Tunisia and Egypt, and are threatening to bring down those of Libya, Yemen and Syria, are now being used in the Palestinian cause. So now we have an opportunity to see how Americans will react. We've asked the Palestinians to lay down their arms. We've told them their lack of a state is their own fault; if only they would embrace non-violence, a reasonable and unprejudiced world would see the merit of their claims. Over the weekend, tens of thousands of them did just that, and it seems likely to continue. If crowds of tens of thousands of non-violent Palestinian protestors continue to march, and if Israel continues to shoot at them, what will we do? Will we make good on our rhetoric, and press Israel to give them their state? Or will it turn out that our paeans to non-violence were just cynical tactics in an amoral international power contest staged by militaristic Israeli and American right-wing groups whose elective affinities lead them to shape a common narrative of the alien Arab/Muslim threat? Will we even bother to acknowledge that the Palestinians are protesting non-violently? Or will we soldier on with the same empty decades-old rhetoric, now drained of any truth or meaning, because it protects established relationships of power? What will it take to make Americans recognise that the real Martin Luther King-style non-violent Palestinian protestors have arrived, and that Israeli soldiers are shooting them with real bullets?

https://www.economist.com/letters-to-the-editor-the-inbox/2007/03/01/historic-palestine,"SIR —Your statement that ""Fatah reluctantly accepts the need to partition historic Palestine between a Jewish state and an Arab one"" overlooks the fact that such a partition has already occurred.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/01/30/mahmoud-abbas-calls-for-elections-in-palestine,"MOST PALESTINIANS are probably too young to remember when their president, Mahmoud Abbas, took power in 2005. He was elected to a four-year term, the first of two permitted by law. He never got round to holding another vote, yet he remains in charge, having served four times his mandate. Amazingly, he could soon win another term. On January 15th Mr Abbas announced the first elections in the occupied territories in more than 15 years. Many Palestinians were understandably sceptical. Calling for new elections is something of an annual tradition for Mr Abbas, who turned 85 in November. They never happen. Increasingly autocratic, Mr Abbas is loth to risk his grip on power. Perhaps he is more serious this time. Against the grain of years past, he has fixed dates for the elections, with a parliamentary ballot in May and a presidential one in July. But even if they happen they are unlikely to bring sweeping change: Mr Abbas could be the only viable candidate for president. His announcement does not reflect a desire for fresh faces or a new direction. Instead, it is a gesture to the new president in Washington. The Palestinians had a hard time with Donald Trump, to say the least; relations with America have not been this bad since the 1980s. Mr Abbas is eager to start anew with Joe Biden. Yet he is likely to be disappointed with the new administration, which has neither the time nor the inclination to wander down the cul-de-sac of Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy. In his effort to court the Americans, Mr Abbas may simply illustrate how bereft of ideas he is. Three out of four Palestinians support his call for elections. But they are not terribly enthusiastic about their choices. A survey conducted in December by Palestine’s leading pollster found that 66% of the public want Mr Abbas to resign. He would probably lose a race against Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls Gaza. It may not field a candidate, though. The group’s experiment with governance has been a disaster. Under blockade by Israel and Egypt, Gaza is an open-air prison where 2m people live in miserable conditions. Better to have Mr Abbas as a foil than to be responsible for the West Bank as well. There are few other credible challengers for the throne. Despite his advanced age, Mr Abbas has not designated a successor, and occasionally cuts down rivals within his nationalist Fatah party. The only name that excites voters is Marwan Barghouti, a prominent member of Fatah who would probably romp home to victory. But he would have to run from inside a jail cell. Mr Barghouti was convicted of murder by an Israeli court for organising attacks during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, and is serving multiple life sentences. As for parliament, it has been defunct for more than a decade, owing to a dispute between Hamas and Fatah. Asked who they would choose in a legislative election, 34% of Palestinians said Hamas and 38% Fatah (in the election of 2006 they won 44% and 41% of the vote, respectively). The rest opted for third parties or were undecided. A good showing could give Hamas a foothold in the West Bank, where both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) have long worked to suppress it. Many of the president’s own lieutenants are therefore opposed to holding elections now. The decision is an uncharacteristic risk for the stuffy Mr Abbas, one he hopes will leave him with a renewed mandate and a smidgen of goodwill in Washington. It is hard to remember now, but his relationship with Mr Trump began amicably. After their first meeting at the White House, in May 2017, Mr Abbas declared “with you, we have hope.” But there was an irreparable break in December of that year, when Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved America’s embassy there, breaking with decades of bipartisan consensus that it should remain in Tel Aviv. For the Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem should be resolved in a final peace agreement. They saw Mr Trump’s move as an effort to prejudge the outcome. Things went from bad to worse. In 2018 Mr Trump set out to halt all American aid to the Palestinians, including funds for the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees and for the Palestinian security forces that America helped train and equip. He also closed the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington. In 2020 he released a “peace plan” seen as hopelessly biased: it allowed Israel to keep about a quarter of the occupied West Bank. Last year Mr Abbas compounded his problems. Buoyed by Mr Trump’s plan, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, contemplated annexing parts of the West Bank. In protest, Mr Abbas stopped accepting transfers of tax revenue that Israel collects on the PA’s behalf. That cash covers 60% of the authority’s budget. Without it, many workers went unpaid or received only half their salaries. Some accepted this as a sacrifice for the greater good. In August, however, it became a needless sacrifice. Israel suspended talk of annexation in return for diplomatic ties with the United Arab Emirates, a decision that could bring economic dividends as well (see article). Mr Abbas, like many Palestinians, saw the Emirati move as a betrayal. He was unwilling to reverse his decision on the tax revenue without some diplomatic victory of his own. By the time he relented, in November, the Palestinian economy had suffered. Almost one in six Palestinians in the West Bank works for the government, in jobs that tend to pay better than the private sector. The unemployment rate in the West Bank rose from 13% in the third quarter of 2019 to 19% a year later. No surprise, then, that the Biden administration seems a breath of fresh air. The new president has already promised to renew aid to the Palestinians and restore diplomatic ties. Yet some of the hope in him is misplaced. For a start, Mr Biden will not reverse all his predecessor’s policies, as Tony Blinken, his secretary of state, made clear at his confirmation hearing. Asked if the administration recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and planned to keep America’s embassy there, he gave a succinct answer: “yes and yes”. Nor is the new president a miracle worker. He cannot end the schism between Palestinians nor reverse the hawkish tilt in Israeli politics. America has spent three decades trying to broker a deal between Israel and the Palestinians; well-intentioned presidents working in better circumstances have failed. Mr Biden’s inbox is filled to overflowing and his political capital is limited. The moribund peace process is unlikely to be a priority. Even many Palestinians would think it a wasted effort. Just 2% believe there is a good chance of securing their own state in the next five years. Most expect to be stuck with the status quo. They have differing ideas about how to break the impasse with Israel (see chart). A solid majority, 63%, backs a campaign of non-violent resistance. Pluralities agree with armed struggle (48%) and dissolving the PA (44%), while 29% support abandoning the two-state solution and pushing for a binational state that Arabs and Jews would share between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river. One can debate the merits of each path. Calls for a one-state solution would meet broad opposition in Israel. Even in the most amoral assessment, the violence of the second intifada was a strategic mistake, one that hardened public opinion against Palestinians both in Israel and overseas. These debates are common in the territories, in cafés, at conferences on social media—everywhere, it seems, but in the halls of power. Mr Abbas may win another four years in office. But he has nothing to offer except the same ideas that led nowhere over the previous sixteen. ■"
https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/02/23/the-ohio-train-derailment-is-turning-into-a-political-circus,"When your correspondent arrived in East Palestine, at around ten in the morning on February 22nd, the only person on Market Street, the town’s main drag, was Eric Walleck, holding a sign reading “Walleck 2024”. Sheltering from the rain under a shop’s awning, Mr Walleck explained that he had come from his home in Illinois to this part of eastern Ohio as part of his independent campaign to become president. “I came to talk to the citizens about the train wreck,” he said. “I’ve got food, I’ve got water in my truck, and I am going to hand it out.” He then admits that so far it hasn’t gone very well. “You’re the first person I have talked to,” he says. Later that day a rather better-known presidential candidate would appear in the town, also with plans to distribute food and water, and limited plans to speak to locals. By 1pm at least 100 people were gathered on Market Street awaiting the arrival of Donald Trump. Two stands had been set up to sell T-shirts, hoodies and flags. Dozens of journalists, YouTubers and TikTok influencers wandered up and down conducting interviews and performing pieces to camera. When Mr Trump finally arrived, just visible through the darkened tint of his SUV, the crowd cheered and broke into a chant of “Let’s Go Brandon”, a meme that means, roughly, “Fuck Joe Biden”. The proximate cause of this circus was a calamity that happened almost three weeks earlier. On February 3rd a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed in East Palestine, a town of a little less than 5,000 people on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Its cargo included dangerous chemicals such as vinyl chloride and butyl acrylate, both of which are used to create plastics. Apparently fearing an explosion, on February 5th Ohio state officials evacuated the town and then burned the spilled chemicals, creating an enormous black cloud over the place. A few days later residents were allowed to return. State and federal officials have declared that the local tap water is safe to drink and the air is safe to breathe. Yet few trust them. There are plenty of legitimate questions about the long-term impact of the chemicals that leaked into the local environment, and about the safety of freight trains in America. But it is a lack of trust in government that has turned a disaster into a political farce. Within days of the disaster right-wing political pundits were busy arguing that the town was not being paid enough attention because its residents are mostly white and voted for Mr Trump. One Fox News presenter suggested that the Environmental Protection Agency was happy with “spilling toxic chemicals on poor white people in Ohio” because it was a way of “fighting environmental racism”. Many people in the town share the feeling that they are being ignored. “Anybody who voted for Donald Trump doesn’t believe the government,” says Traci Ketchum, who lives just outside the town. “And here, that’s 71% of the population.” She says it is thrilling to see her home being discussed on Fox News, though she resents the assertion that its people are poor. Joy Mascher, who runs a florist on Market Street, says the government’s response was hardly quick enough. “The federal government has not stepped up,” she says. “Do we just not matter because we’re in the Rust Belt? This would not have happened in somewhere like Potomac, Maryland.” Mr Trump deftly exploited this sentiment. “You are not forgotten,” he told a small group of locals during his visit on February 22nd. He drew a contrast between his presence in Ohio and the whereabouts of President Joe Biden, who had been in Poland that day, after an earlier stop in Ukraine. Richard Lloyd, who lives around three miles away from where the train derailed, stood waiting for Mr Trump wearing a hazmat suit and a gas mask. “They should be giving these to everyone in this town,” he said. The air is far too unsafe to breathe, he observed, before removing his mask to light a cigarette. Will Mr Trump’s visit do anything to help (not counting the McDonald’s meals the former president purchased for firefighters and the bottles of water he donated)? It does seem to have kept attention on East Palestine. Hours before Mr Trump arrived there, Pete Buttigieg, the transport secretary, announced that he would come to the town the next day. Mr Buttigieg had earlier promised that his department would hold Norfolk Southern “accountable for any safety violations found to have contributed to the disaster”. The results of a preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board were also due to be published on February 23rd (after The Economist went to press). The Senate’s environment committee has pledged to investigate, too. Mr Trump claims none of that would have happened without his promise, made at the end of the previous week, that he would visit the place. Preventing another disaster like this will take more than Mr Trump’s brio. In recent decades the safety of American trains has in fact improved. Compared with a decade ago there are half as many incidents annually involving hazardous-material spills, and roughly 20% fewer derailments. But Ian Naish, a former safety inspector on Canadian railways, says he worries about the future. In recent years profits on the railways have soared, as firms have reduced their headcount and increased the length of trains. With railway safety, you have “got to have a continual chronic sense of unease,” he says. Because even if, overall, safety is improving, the next disaster might happen somewhere more densely populated than East Palestine. ■ Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."
https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2016/06/11/the-view-on-the-ground,"The Way to the Spring: Life and Death in Palestine. By Ben Ehrenreich. Penguin Press; 428 pages; $28. To be published in Britain by Granta in August; £14.99. IN THIS book of many stories, few of them happy, it falls to one young Palestinian to get the measure of things. A man puts out a sweet one day, he says. An ant comes to investigate, but finds it too heavy to carry home. So it leaves and returns with many ants; but meanwhile the man takes the sweet away. The ants look around a bit, and finding nothing, file off. The man then replaces the sweet, and the same ant finds it again. It races off to get the others, but before they can return, the man hides it again. Deceived a second time, the ants turn on the first ant and kill it. This is how, in Palestine, hopes can be crushed only so many times before they turn to despair and then rage. That anger is never far from the surface in “The Way to the Spring”, a new memoir by Ben Ehrenreich, an American writer. It draws on the many months he spent in the occupied West Bank, off and on, from the time of the Arab spring in 2011 to Israel’s bloody incursion into Gaza in 2014. Yet he also calls it a tale of love, and even of hope. Mr Ehrenreich is the author of two well-received novels (“Ether” and “The Suitors”) and he brings a novelist’s eye to his subject, framing the bulk of his book around one village, Nabi Saleh, 30 miles (48km) north-west of Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and around a group of a few dozen protesters, most of them confusingly from the same extended Tamimi family. The spring of the title is a real, not a metaphorical Arab spring; a water source used by the Tamimis and others in Nabi Saleh for many decades until, in 1976, the first Israeli settlers arrived and established a community they later called Halamish. Slowly Halamish expanded, as more and more of the land was taken, often for “military needs”, until in 2008 the spring itself was seized. In 2009 the villagers of Nabi Saleh began what became a long series of marches to their spring; they were opposed by armed settlers, and then by the Israeli army as well, which, the author recounts, fired tear-gas grenades, often directly at the protesters at face or chest height, and rubber-coated bullets. The Tamimis, and Mr Ehrenreich, make a point of always calling them that, not “rubber bullets”. Consisting of a thin layer of rubber around a steel core, a rubber-coated bullet can break a jawbone. It can penetrate the flesh. The Nabi Saleh marches, of course, achieved nothing. But they generated some media attention, and they drew activists and observers not just from Israel but from around the world. They have been, as Bassem Tamimi says, “a way to tell the world that we have the right to work our land…the spring is the face of the occupation, the occupation is illegal and we have the right to struggle against it.” It is in the author’s descriptions of the Tamimis that the hope, and the love, are to be found; the dedication day after day to an effort that yields only failure, sometimes arrest and injury, and even death; and the concern that the Tamimis share for each other, waiting outside detention centres and hospitals for news of a relative. This is also a cause for rage. As Mr Ehrenreich documents, the clan is divided over tactics. And there are much deeper divisions in Palestinian society as a whole. The government of Mahmoud Abbas, who succeeded Yasser Arafat as leader of the Fatah movement after the latter’s death in 2004, draws the hatred of many Palestinians for dealing with the Israelis, and for accepting that his Palestinian Authority gets to control only a fraction of the West Bank, even if the result is that the politically favoured of Ramallah get jobs and money. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a gold cage or an iron cage,” says Bassem. “It’s a cage.” And of course, many have it far worse than in Nabi Saleh. There is Sa’adat Sabri, as the book describes, who lives in a house completely fenced in by Israeli security barriers, with a gate he could go in and out of only when the authorities let him. And there is Hebron, the only city in the West Bank where Israelis still live, and where the Palestinian Arabs run a daily gauntlet of checks, searches and barriers. Many Israelis hate what their government does in the West Bank. But many, too, condone or support it for reasons ranging from fear of terrorism to mistrust of neighbouring Arab states and the conviction that the land from the river to the sea is theirs by right. They may well hate this book; there is little wider context in it, no attempt to investigate, or even to acknowledge, the other side. (One of the exceptions comes from an Israeli in Hebron, who says that “when someone wants to kill, we’ll kill him first…we’re not the religion that gives the second cheek to anyone.”) Mr Ehrenreich did not set out to write an objective book; he does not even think it is possible. This is simply a description, detailed and sometimes too much so, of what the facts on the ground look like if you are one of a particular group of Palestinians in the West Bank. It should be read by friends and foes of Israel alike. "

https://www.economist.com/international/2000/12/16/palestines-shrinking-christians,"CHRISTIAN Palestinians are feeling bruised. The quarrel between their churches and Israel's Islamist movement over the building of a mosque in Nazareth has dented the belief that, among Palestinians, religion should take second place to nationalism—and reminded them how few their numbers have become. At the end of the 19th century, Christian Palestinians accounted for about 13% of the people in the Holy Land. Today they are 2%: 120,000 in Israel and a paltry 50,000 in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.  Israel's birth in 1948 forced waves of Palestinian refugees—some Christian, but mostly Muslim—to seek haven in the West Bank, turning Christian towns like Bethlehem and Ramallah into cities with Muslim majorities. After Israel's occupation of the West Bank in 1967, came hardships that spurred Palestinian Christians, a prosperous and well-educated group, to emigrate at twice the rate of Muslims. “When Muslims lose hope, they resort to fundamentalism, thus emigrating psychologically. When Christians lose hope, they emigrate geographically,” says Mitri Rahab, Bethlehem's Lutheran pastor. Some believed that the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) would stem both tides. Six years into the Oslo process, Christians are no longer so hopeful. Binyamin Netanyahu's government used to speak of the PA's “relentless persecution” of Christians. In fact, whatever Yasser Arafat's undoubted faults, sectarianism is not one of them and Christians tend to be more forgiving of their autocratic president than other Palestinians. The Christian fear is that a future Palestinian state will be Islamist, particularly in its laws and education. “I have no problem with Islam being the religion of the state of Palestine,” says Bernard Sabella, a sociologist at Bethlehem University. “I do have a problem with a religiously based state.” The omens are not encouraging. The national curriculum now being prepared for schools in the West Bank and Gaza equates the history of Palestine largely with the Islamic conquest of Palestine. The only “Christian” references concern the Crusades and Napoleon. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/11/23/decoding-donald-trumps-efforts-to-draw-a-road-map-for-israel-and-palestine,"PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP casts himself as a master negotiator. But when he talks of trying to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians, he often sounds less confident. It is a “complex subject”, the “toughest deal of all”, said Mr Trump in September. Still, he rates his chances of success as “very, very good”. A peace plan from the administration, expected in September, is now due in January. Mr Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner (pictured, centre), is leading the effort. He is being helped by Jason Greenblatt, the president’s envoy to the Middle East; David Friedman, the ambassador to Israel; and Dina Powell, a deputy national-security adviser. The first three are orthodox Jews who do not conceal their pro-Israel sympathies. Initially dismissed as neophytes, the team has won over sceptics with its willingness to listen. Even the Palestinians admire their readiness to take soundings in refugee camps, not just from politicians. They find the team more genial than Barack Obama’s “pen-pushers”. Mr Greenblatt, the chief negotiator, has opposed unilateral moves by Israel and welcomed the Palestinian reconciliation deal between the nationalist Fatah group (which controls the West Bank) and Hamas, an Islamist group (which holds sway in Gaza). The administration has been tight-lipped about the details of its plan, but those who have spoken to Mr Greenblatt describe it as more of a process—“a road map without a defined road”, says one Palestinian negotiator. The initial steps will probably be little more than confidence-building measures. The harder problems, such as drawing borders, returning refugees and resolving the status of Jerusalem, would be left until much later. It is not even certain that the endgame is two states, which most of the world has long demanded. Among the ideas being mooted is eventually to put Jewish settlements in the West Bank under Palestinian control. The lack of clarity is seen as a tactic aimed at keeping everyone on board. Whatever the administration produces, Saudi Arabia is likely to support it. Mr Kushner has struck up a friendship with Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. Though the prince’s foreign-policy record is not widely admired, he seems to have convinced Mr Kushner that he can help reshape the Middle East in ways that suit America. At Mr Trump’s behest he summoned the octogenarian Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to Riyadh earlier this month and urged him to embrace the American plan. Mr Abbas is seen by all sides (including his own) as plodding, time-serving and compromised. For Prince Muhammad, it seems, Palestinian aspirations to statehood are less important than countering Iran, which has extended its influence in the region. He has sought a closer relationship with Israel, which shares his dark view. There are reports that the Jewish state has shared intelligence with Saudi Arabia to help it in its war against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Prince Muhammad may calculate that a viable peace process would give him political cover to make the alliance more overt. Other Arab states also have an interest in restarting talks. Egypt under Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi has taken a more active role in the peace process and recently helped to end the feud between Hamas and Fatah. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates support Mr Sisi’s aim of cutting Hamas off from Iran and Qatar. Under a deal, they would probably fund development in Palestinian areas and furnish Israel with security guarantees. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has long seemed reluctant to negotiate with the Palestinians. But he might prefer an open-ended process to one with clear milestones and deadlines that would pin him down. He also wants to show gratitude to Mr Trump for not pushing him as hard as Mr Obama did. The Palestinians are also loth to alienate the Americans. But they fear being pushed into a deal that leaves Israel in military control of the West Bank. (The Israelis have already pushed for Hamas to be disarmed before the talks begin.) “Neither Netanyahu nor Abbas wants to insult the American plan, but neither has any real interest in it either,” says Jon Alterman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington, DC. In the region, officials rate the chances of success as very, very low. “They won’t find a way to make the circle square after so many others have tried,” says an Israeli diplomat. “Both sides are looking for ways to say no to Mr Trump,” says a Palestinian negotiator. On this, at least, they agree."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2011/09/24/the-war-over-statehood,"TO JUDGE by the vehemence of the arguments, the issue could be a matter of war or peace. “A UN vote on Palestinian membership would be ruinous,” says the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal claims that Palestinians are merely seeking “another tool in their perpetual campaign to harass, delegitimise and ultimately destroy Israel.” America's Congress has threatened to withdraw funds if Palestine is recognised as a state. Yet the Arabs have given equally dire warnings that if America casts a veto, its much-vaunted efforts to mend relations with the Arab and Muslim world will have been worthless. On September 16th Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, reiterated his determination to go directly to the Security Council to bid for full UN membership, knowing that the United States would veto it. But such a bid might be passed on to a committee within the council, where it could be stuck for years. The general guess is that, once rejected by the council, the only body that can confer full membership, Mr Abbas would seek a lesser version of membership in the UN General Assembly, where no veto can be wielded. That is where Europeans have been concentrating their efforts. Many favour the so-called “Vatican option” whereby Palestine would become an “observer state”: not a full member, but at least no longer a mere “entity”. Such a resolution, it is assumed, would include a reassertion that any final accord would recognise Israel and guarantee its security, and that the mutual border would be based on the 1967 line, with land swaps; that the states would share Jerusalem as their capital; and that the Palestinian refugee problem would be resolved. For their part, the Palestinians, under European prodding, would agree not to use their new-won statehood to launch prosecutions against Israelis at the International Criminal Court. The Americans would almost certainly vote against the Vatican option too, and their position would delight Israel's hard core of Jewish settlers in the West Bank (see article). Yet some liberal Israelis think a “moderate victory” may actually jolt the peace process into life. “If the Palestinians lose,” says one, “[Abbas] is finished. The winner will be Hamas [the harder-line Islamist movement that officially rejects Israel's existence and runs the Gaza Strip].” The Israeli government, however, argues that the Palestinian bid is a huge and potentially tragic mistake. “The only way to achieve a Palestinian state and peace is through direct negotiations,” says an Israeli official, adding that the Palestinians have not “seriously” engaged in talks for the past three years. The mistake would become “irrevocable”, he adds, if a resolution passed in the General Assembly prescribes a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. Palestinians respond that Mr Netanyahu is not ready to negotiate a two-state agreement. One of his demands, that the Palestinians must first recognise Israel as a Jewish state, seems intended merely to prevent talks restarting. Many Europeans and Americans wonder whether Mr Netanyahu is himself a dyed-in-the-wool rejectionist, or is simply in thrall to the ultra-nationalists in his coalition. The Israelis know that they will be heavily, indeed humiliatingly, outvoted in the General Assembly. A good two-thirds of the UN's 193 members will vote for Palestinian statehood. To increase the “moral minority”, as Mr Netanyahu calls it, Israel has been particularly keen to persuade the European Union collectively to vote against—or, failing that, at least to get Germany and Italy to vote no. But France and Spain seem minded to say yes, with Britain hovering in between (see Charlemagne). Israel's isolation has recently been underlined by the deterioration of its relations with Turkey and Egypt. Last month Turkey's government threw out Israel's ambassador and downgraded diplomatic ties. Then, this month, Israeli diplomats in Egypt were forced to flee when their embassy was attacked by demonstrators. More recently still, Israeli diplomats, fearing similar assaults, temporarily quit Jordan, the other Arab country with which Israel has a peace treaty. Israeli officials fear that the Palestinian move at the UN will spark new violence in the West Bank, after a long period of quiet. Co-operation between the Israeli army and Palestinian security forces loyal to Mr Abbas and his Palestinian Authority (PA) may, they think, become trickier. The PA hopes for large but peaceful demonstrations in support of its UN diplomacy. The Israelis say that, since nothing will change on the ground, Palestinian disappointment may boil over into violence. Back in the West Bank For many Palestinians, the UN bid feels like déjà vu. In 1999 Yasser Arafat declared he would secure full statehood, but backed off when Mr Netanyahu blocked him. “Two months ago, no one believed [Mr Abbas] would go to the UN in the face of American and Israeli pressure,” says the owner of an IT consultancy in Nablus, in the West Bank. “Saying no to a superpower is something big for us.” But Mr Abbas has outsmarted his internal as well as his external critics, and the latest opinion polls suggest that 83% of Palestinians in the territories back the UN bid. The Arab spring has changed the Palestinian political dynamic. Egypt's erstwhile president, Hosni Mubarak, often told the Palestinians publicly “to avoid endangering the peace process” by seeking statehood. The new Egyptian order, while it will be loth to break the peace treaty with Israel, will not take the Mubarak line. Turkey has hinted at compensating the Palestinians in the West Bank if America's Congress withholds funds. And on September 12th Prince Turki al-Faisal, a long-serving former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote that Saudi Arabia would “no longer be able to co-operate with America in the same way it historically has” if America votes against Palestinian statehood. Mr Abbas is winning praise for his boldness, yet problems dog him at home. For the past four years the PA's prime minister has been a technocrat, Salam Fayyad, who has much impressed the Western powers financing his fledgling government. But Mr Abbas has promised that, after his UN bid, he will restart talks on forming a government with Hamas, which loathes the secular Mr Fayyad. Indeed, Mr Abbas has also promised fresh elections, in the hope that, thanks to improvements on the West Bank, his Fatah group will win. It would be a supreme irony if, having won statehood on paper, Mr Abbas were again hobbled or even defeated by a party that still rejects the two-state solution."
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2002/10/10/post-1967-un-resolutions-relating-to-israel-palestine,"Resolution 252 (May 1968): All measures and actions taken by Israel with the aim of changing the legal status of Jerusalem, “including the expropriation of land and properties thereon are invalid and cannot change that status”.  Resolution 446 (March 1979): “The policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity.” Israel must “rescind its previous measures and...desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and, in particular, not...transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories.” Resolution 465 (March 1980) Israel's settlement policy constitutes “a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War”. It “calls upon all States not to provide Israel with any assistance to be used for settlements in the occupied territories”.  Resolution 471 (June 1980) re-emphasises the illegality of Israeli settlements and expresses concern “that Jewish settlers...are allowed to carry arms thus enabling them to perpetrate crimes against the civilian Arab population”.  Resolution 605 (December 1987), passed at the beginning of the first Palestinian intifada, deplores the “policies and practices of Israel which violate the human rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories”. Resolutions 607 (January 1988), 636 (July 1989), 694 (May 1991), 726 (January 1992) and 799 (December 1992) condemn Israel's deportation of Palestinian civilians from the occupied territories, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Resolution 904 (March 1994), after the massacre of Palestinian worshippers in Hebron by Baruch Goldstein, calls upon Israel to prevent illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers. It also demands measures to guarantee the safety of Palestinian civilians, including “a temporary international or foreign presence”, as provided for by the Oslo Accords.  Resolution 1322 (October 2000), passed soon after the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, “deplores the provocation carried out at al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem on September 28 2000” (the visit of Ariel Sharon, to emphasise Israel's sovereignty over the area), and the subsequent violence in the occupied territories.  Resolution 1405 (April 2002) expresses concern at “the dire humanitarian situation of the Palestinian civilian population”, particularly in Jenin refugee camp, and calls for “the lifting of restrictions imposed on the operations of humanitarian organisations”.  Resolution 1435 (September 2002) condemns “all terrorist attacks against civilians” and also demands “the expeditious withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces from Palestinian cities”."
https://www.economist.com/the-war-in-gaza-may-mark-a-watershed-for-the-palestinian-authority/2023/10/14/,"FOR MONTHS fears have been rising in Israel and among foreign governments that a surge in violence is in the offing in the West Bank. It is the area that Palestinians view as the core of a would-be state, which for decades has been occupied and overseen by Israel’s government in tandem with the Palestinian Authority (PA), the nearest thing to a local Arab administration. It was thought that the increasing brutality shown towards Palestinians by Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank might spark an uprising, or intifada. Now the war in Gaza adds a new dimension to the situation: Hamas says one motivation for its attack on Israel is to inspire a broader uprising across the West Bank that overthrows the feeble pa. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas On October 12th Israel’s government told roughly 1.1m Gazans, half of the territory’s population, to flee to its southern half. It is widely assumed that this heralds a military invasion of Gaza’s northern half. That could catalyse more outbreaks of unrest on the West Bank. After Hamas’s initial murderous assault on October 7th, tensions soared. On October 11th and 12th Israeli settlers shot dead six Palestinians in the West Bank village of Qusra. In clashes on the West Bank, Israeli security forces and settlers have shot and killed a total of 52 Palestinians since the Hamas attack. Though the bloodshed is nothing like as extreme as that around Gaza, the death toll is already high even by the West Bank’s grim standards. The situation there is not yet out of control, but it is edging that way. Even as Hamas’s assault from Gaza was still unfolding, celebrations erupted in the West Bank’s cities. Hundreds of people paraded through the centre of Ramallah, waving the green flags of Hamas. This is the seat of the PA, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas and his secular Fatah party, which is Hamas’s sworn rival and was kicked out of Gaza by it 16 years ago.  In Nablus and Jenin, two of the West Bank’s other main cities, masked militants and civilians in their hundreds gathered in the streets to praise the attack. Some handed out sweets. Others posed for pictures with rifles. The key question is how the Palestinians of the West Bank will respond to the mounting bloodshed in Gaza, as Israel bombs it from the air and prepares for a ground attack into the densely populated enclave. Most West Bank Palestinians sympathise with the plight of their Gazan cousins. Hamas remains stubbornly popular in both Palestinian territories. Tension in the West Bank tends to rise whenever clashes with Israel forces erupt in either territory. “We’d prefer Hamas not to do it [attack Israel],” says a PA official. “But when Israel responds, it is not seen as an attack against Hamas, but as part of a 75-year-long war on the Palestinian nation.” Israel is trying to keep a lid on the West Bank with heavy policing. Even the short drive between Nablus and Ramallah is now pocked with checkpoints. Yet Israel’s armed forces are already stretched thin across several fronts: not just around Gaza but also on the border with Lebanon. There the Israelis have already exchanged fire with Hizbullah, an Iranian-backed militia that is armed with well over 100,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel. A wide eruption of violence and unrest in the West Bank on the scale of the last major intifada there, which lasted from 2000-2005 and claimed about 3,000 Palestinian and 1,000 Israeli lives, would stretch Israel’s forces even more thinly across a third front. The more than 3m Palestinians who live in the West Bank are wealthier and have much more to lose than those in Gaza. Few of those who lived through the last intifada want to see a repetition of its death and destruction. Many Palestinians in the territory rely on the salaries of family members who work in Israel, with which the West Bank’s economy is entwined. Hence the Palestinians of the West Bank have shown little desire to confront Israel directly, however much they may loathe the Israeli occupation. In the past couple of years new militant groups have emerged from the West Bank’s hotbeds of discontent, especially in Nablus and the Jenin refugee camp. They have come out vociferously in support of the Hamas attack. But they have not yet sent out their fighters in force against Israeli targets in the West Bank, partly because they are conscious that Israel still has very much the upper hand there. Still, a wave of attacks or killings of West Bank Palestinians by Israeli settlers, such as those that occurred in Qusra, might well push large numbers of Palestinians and their new militant groups into open revolt. The PA is desperate to avoid this third intifada, because it would undermine its very existence. The PA’s survival depends largely on its co-operation with Israel on almost every matter, ranging from security to the granting of work permits to Palestinians in Israel. An open confrontation with Israel could destroy the PA. Yet on the other hand it cannot bring itself to condemn Hamas’s recent onslaught. The PA fears that doing so would be seen as opposing what the Palestinians hail as their resistance to Israel’s occupation and would drain what little credibility it still has on the Palestinian street. Even before the Hamas attack, the sclerotic PA was in crisis. Donor fatigue and local mismanagement have left it struggling to pay the salaries of public employees in recent months. Mr Abbas has repeatedly cancelled elections, further reducing his legitimacy. And the PA has been unable to protect Palestinians from Israeli settler violence, which has increased since last year’s formation of a far-right government by Binyamin Netanyahu. Last month 87% of Palestinians told the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah that the PA was corrupt. The bloodbath caused by Hamas will add to the PA’s woes. On October 9th the European Commission said it was reviewing annual funds worth almost €691m ($728m) that it gives to the Palestinians. The governments of Austria and Germany announced similar reviews of their aid. One of the few cards Mr Abbas has to play is his recently warming relations with Saudi Arabia, something Palestinian officials have put much hope in. On October 10th Mr Abbas telephoned Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, urging him to become a mediator in order to protect civilians in Gaza. A day later the prince spoke for the first time to Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi. The prospect of Saudi Arabia getting involved as a mediator is, however, a long shot. If Mr Abbas fails to get support from European donors or the Saudis, let alone the Israelis, the PA could face a financial crisis so deep that the PA’s security forces, which are supposed to police parts of the West Bank, may collapse. The result would be chaos and perhaps even open the door to a takeover of the West Bank by Hamas or other militant factions. It would also mean an end to the PA’s security co-operation with Israel, which would lead to more frequent Israeli raids, a more intrusive security presence and probably much greater bloodshed. The war in Gaza marks a watershed for the PA. It has no easy choices. Either it can maintain its current refusal to condemn Hamas and risk being cut off by its foreign donors and friends, which could lead to its total collapse. Or it can come out firmly against it in the hope of regaining international support but at the risk of enraging so many Palestinians on the street that they sweep the PA aside. Mr Abbas tends to avoid making decisions, let alone such tough ones. The odds are that he will try to muddle through with equivocation, hoping that the PA can survive long enough to see Hamas, its main rival, crushed in Gaza by Israel. ■"
https://www.economist.com/letters/2007/03/01/on-global-warming-europes-future-anna-nicole-smith-visas-israel-and-palestine-transporting-cash-the-romans,"SIR – Your article on the fourth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the range of the IPCC's predictions of the rise in temperature by 2100 “leaves plenty of scope for argument about whether it is worth trying to do anything about climate change” (“Heating up”, February 10th). This misinterprets the IPCC's report, which presents best estimates of the rise in temperature between 2000 and 2100 for several different emission scenarios. The lowest emission scenario (range 1.1-2.9°C) would probably warm the planet by 1.8°C. The best estimate for the highest emission scenario is a rise of 4.0°C (range 2.4-6.4°C).  The provision of ranges for each emission scenario actually represents a significant reduction in uncertainty compared with the IPCC's third report. The key point is that the amount of global warming depends on which emission path we choose. When the new estimates are added to the 0.6°C of warming that has happened during the 20th century, the fourth report shows that it is indeed worth doing something. Even if we choose the lowest emission path we can expect warming of about 2.4°C by 2100, relative to pre-industrial times. Given that warming greater than 2°C puts us at risk of irreversible changes to the climate system, our path of action is clear: we must ensure our output of greenhouse gases is under the range of the lowest emission scenario and well below “business as usual”. Sean Nixon  Sierra Legal Vancouver SIR – Charlemagne believes there are “only two basic types” for a multi-speed Europe (“Coalitions for the willing”, February 3rd). “Multi-speed” suggests Helmut Kohl's idea of a convoy with some catching up later on. The first type, the idea of concentric circles advocated by Mr Kohl's adviser, Michael Mertes, is based on the assumption that there would be one legal framework but that some could join later or alternatively remain on the margin. The second type assumes that there would be a centre of gravity around the single market but within a framework that assumes the acquis, the body of European Union law and regulations, and again a central legal framework. Both of these create a second-class membership, which is wholly unacceptable. Both “enhanced co-operation” (a legal term of art) and “variable geometry” suffer from the assumption of an overarching legal order and an acquis set in concrete.  A “multi-dimensional”, rather than multi-speed, approach would be more appropriate. As you point out, the EU at present subscribes in theory to a system that does not exist or work in practice, but there is clearly another way. A far better formula is an association of nation states along the lines of the European Free Trade Area. The world has moved on since the EU was originally conceived and the case for an association of nation states is now stronger than ever. Multi-dimensional, not multi-speed. Bill Cash, MP House of Commons London SIR – I have long considered the influential lives portrayed in your weekly obituary to comprise a deserving, exclusive club, to which I could only aspire. However, now that you have immortalised the “pneumatic” Anna Nicole Smith (Obituary, February 17th), who was unskilled, uneducated and untalented, and despite her having absolutely no impact on the global economy, world politics or the advancement of the human species, it is clear that I must set my sights higher, or engineer bigger breasts. Donna Anton Hayle, Cornwall SIR – I am dismayed that you followed the tabloids by devoting a page to Ms Smith and acquiesced in her life-long wish to be compared to the incomparable Marilyn Monroe.  Melissa Perez Ann Arbor, Michigan  SIR – Allow me to add a few facts to your article on the “disquiet” over visa restrictions on visitors to the United States (“Keeping out more than terrorists”, February 10th). Applicants for visas receive an appointment within 15 days at 80% of our diplomatic posts and we are aggressively reducing backlogs at the rest. Once approved, 97% of visas are issued within two days of the interview; half of the remainder are issued within two weeks.  All diplomatic posts expedite student and business visas, often in conjunction with the local American Chamber of Commerce. The result? You correctly noted that 12% more business visas were issued last year than in 2005, but the figure is even higher in some countries such as Brazil, China and South Korea. We've created 570 consular positions to handle the growing demand and more are on the way. Welcoming foreign visitors is critical to this country's economy and national image; the best advertisement for America is America.  Maura Harty Assistant secretary for consular affairs State Department Washington, DC SIR – As you say, in order to lift its boycott the Western world has set three sensible conditions on the Palestinian Authority (“A holy but puzzling alliance”, February 17th). But when will we set the same three conditions on Israel: to recognise Palestine, to renounce violence and to keep their side of previous agreements? How can we expect peace in the Middle East when we boycott the Palestinians yet reward Israel with billions of dollars of aid when both sides are ignoring the basic preconditions for peace? The conditions are simple. Apply them equally to both sides and peace will have a chance.  Kamal Hassan Toronto SIR – I was interested to read that there were 700 raids on cash-transport vehicles in Britain in 2005 (“We were Heros”, February 10th). In the 1930s I worked opposite a bank in the City of London. From time to time a horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top would pull up outside the bank. The driver would remain in his seat while a lad got out to lower the tailgate so that the bank's employees could meander out with gold bricks and place them in the wagon. The lad then closed the tailgate, climbed back into the wagon and off it went. A policeman standing nearby while the loading was being done would then wander off. How times have changed.  Brian Lowe Rosebud, Australia SIR – The idea of recruiting foreigners to serve in an army has a long tradition (“The green-card brigade”, February 3rd). The Romans recruited men-at-arms from border tribes to defend their empire and found that when given citizenship, the tribesmen were more Roman than the Romans and became very enthusiastic about fighting their former brethren.

https://www.economist.com/britain/2014/10/18/a-state-of-things-to-come,"IN HIS declaration of 1917 giving Britain’s backing for the creation of a Jewish homeland, Arthur Balfour, the then foreign secretary, undertook to uphold the civil and religious rights of the native population of Palestine. A century later after less than total success, Britain’s Parliament added national rights as well. On October 13th it voted by 274 votes to 12 to recognise a Palestinian state. On the face of it, the backbench vote will have little impact. It is not binding, sets no deadline for recognition and will not change government policy, says David Cameron, the Conservative prime minister. Over half of MPs abstained. But as a barometer of European sentiment, the vote is telling. Since last summer’s Gaza war and recent appropriations of Palestinian land, even Israel’s allies have found its actions hard to stomach. “If it is losing people like me, it is going to be losing a lot of people,” said Richard Ottaway, the pro-Israel chairman of Parliament’s foreign affairs committee. To downplay the significance of the vote, Mr Cameron abstained. Yet this might also reflect growing ambivalence towards Israel, some claimed. After siding with Israel early in the Gaza war, Mr Cameron denounced Israel’s post-war landgrab as “utterly deplorable”. That growing concern has had little discernible impact on relations. Bilateral trade has risen 28% year-on-year. And Israel can be thick-skinned about how the world views it. “There’s a bit of a tendency to write off Europeans as Nazi-hugging anti-semites,” says a Western diplomat in Tel Aviv. But the vote may encourage others in Europe to do more than just urge the parties to end Israel’s occupations by negotiation, as they have for 23 years. Earlier this month, Sweden’s new prime minister, Stefan Lofven, said his country, too, would recognise a Palestinian state. And when the issue of Palestinian UN membership next comes to the Security Council, as it may soon, the parliamentary vote might make it a bit harder for Britain to oppose it."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/06/27/an-underwhelming-start-to-the-ultimate-israeli-palestinian-deal,"IT COULD HAVE been Davos, or any other conference on the annual circuit for the world’s wealthy. Jared Kushner, the son-in-law and adviser to America’s president, took the stage in Manama to offer his vision for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The combatants, he lectured, were “trapped in an inefficient framework of the past”. The IMF director suggested looking at best practices from Mozambique. During a surreal segment on property rights, which lie at the very heart of the conflict, the moderator mused about using blockchain for Palestinian land deeds. Before he took office in 2017 Donald Trump vowed to broker the “ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians. To oversee the effort he chose Mr Kushner, a property developer with no experience in diplomacy or the Middle East. The result has been roughly as expected. There is still no plan for resolving the underlying conflict and its many thorny issues: borders, refugees, the status of Jerusalem, or the very notion of Palestinian statehood. Its release has been repeatedly delayed. Diplomats hint that it may remain on the shelf until Mr Trump’s second term, if he wins one. Instead Mr Kushner organised this two-day confab in Bahrain. Dubbed the “Peace to Prosperity” workshop, the centrepiece was a 96-page plan that pledged $50bn-worth of investment in Palestine and neighbouring countries after a peace deal. The document is impressive in scope. It suggests projects to boost agriculture and tourism, fix Palestine’s infrastructure and improve governance. All of this would be funded by a mix of grants, concessional loans and private money. Missing amid all this detail was anything about the Israeli occupation, in its various forms, of the West Bank and Gaza, or about the schism between the Palestinian leaders in the two territories. The plan presupposes that the Holy Land’s noxious politics have simply vanished. Mr Kushner would spend $5bn to connect the West Bank and Gaza, for example. Israel has promised to do this for years but never has, because the link is not simply a matter of building a monorail: it raises complex political and security questions. The $2bn plan to give Palestine 5G wireless infrastructure would thrill entrepreneurs, but there was no mention of how to overcome objections from the Israeli army, which let the West Bank have 3G only last year, a decade after the rest of the world. None of the speakers in Bahrain commented on this dissonance, perhaps because few were familiar with the conflict, or even its geography. To estimate the cost of installing 5G in Palestine, the president of AT&T compared it with Mexico, which he said was five to ten times as big (it is in fact 316 times larger). As it stands, the plan is thoroughly unrealistic. That is the point, Mr Kushner’s supporters argue. It is meant to offer the Palestinians a peace dividend, an incentive to accept his (perhaps) forthcoming political vision. They certainly need the help. Unemployment in the West Bank is 17%. In Gaza it is more than 50%. Adjusted for inflation, GDP per person is almost unchanged from 20 years ago. But to the Palestinians this smells like a bribe from a hostile president. Mr Trump cut all American aid to them. He overturned decades of precedent to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. And aides hint that the political plan will give the Palestinians far less than the sovereign state along the pre-1967 borders that they demand. So they decided to boycott the workshop. Their president, Mahmoud Abbas, refused to send anyone from his government. “The deal of shame will go to hell,” he said in May. The private sector also declined invitations. Arab states were thus reluctant to share a stage with Israeli officials—who were not invited in the end, though some Israeli businessmen did come. Reporters from six Israeli outlets sent fawning dispatches. The country’s largest newspaper, Israel Hayom, which backs both Mr Trump and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, dubbed Bahrain the “island of hope”, an odd appellation for a kingdom that crushed a popular uprising in 2011. And that, perhaps, points to the real outcome of the workshop. It was the most public manifestation of a long and mostly private rapprochement between Israel and the Gulf states, one the Trump administration is keen to promote. The event did nothing to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it was another sign that the Gulf states are looking to move past it. Though they are not quite ready to recognise Israel, they see it as an ally against a shared threat from Iran. The Palestinians have far less to offer. “All we have is our moral power,” says Mkhaimer Abu Saada, a political analyst in Gaza. That still counts for something—but less and less each passing day. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/10/26/the-balfour-declaration-still-offers-lessons-to-israel-and-the-palestinians,"IN OCTOBER 1917, in the depths of the first world war, an expectant Chaim Weizmann was waiting in a London anteroom. Britain’s war cabinet was voting on a document, now known as the Balfour Declaration, that would pledge Britain’s support for Zionists’ hopes of statehood in Ottoman-ruled Palestine. Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, rushed out to share the good news: “Weizmann, it’s a boy!” But the 67-word declaration was vague. It offered a Jewish “homeland”, not a state. Nor did Britain explain how it would be created, promising only “best endeavours” to do so. The Zionist leader’s first reaction was disappointment. The boy “was not the one I had expected,” he later wrote. A century on, his successors have no such doubts. On November 2nd Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, will attend a dinner in London to celebrate the document’s centenary. Theresa May, the British prime minister, will join him. So will Lord Balfour, a descendant of the man who lent his name to the letter. In Jerusalem, the Knesset will hold a special session. The British Museum may lend Israel the original letter to put on display. Yet Weizmann was right to be sceptical. Britain, mired in war, was unsure how to handle Palestine. Some officials wanted to offer a homeland to the Jews, in part because they hewed to the anti-Semitic trope that Jews were influential enough to bring America into the war and flip the Ottomans to the Allied side. And British diplomats made contradictory promises to the Sherif of Mecca and the French. Mr Weizmann believed that the support of world powers, particularly Britain, would be enough to create a Jewish homeland. At the time Jews made up less than 10% of the population in Palestine. They lacked the resources or the strength to establish a state. With time, Britain would obstruct the Zionist project. To quell an Arab revolt it published a white paper in 1939 that capped Jewish immigration to Palestine and stated “unequivocally” that it should not become a Jewish state. By then, however, the Jewish community had organised itself, forming militias, a parliament and a nascent government. When the UN voted in 1947 to partition Palestine, the Jews already had the trappings of their state. “What matters is not what the goyim [gentiles] say, but what the Jews do,” said David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister. That history is still relevant. An ascendant Israeli right wants more settlements in the lands that Israel occupied in 1967, more restrictions on left-wing NGOs, more efforts to limit “liberal” institutions like the courts and the media. It claims not to care about the world’s opinion—and to be fair, much of the world does not have one. Israel’s emerging allies in Africa and Latin America see a vibrant high-tech sector and useful military co-operation. In July Mr Netanyahu welcomed Narendra Modi to Jerusalem, the first-ever visit by an Indian prime minister. Though only Egypt and Jordan have recognised Israel, other Arab states, particularly in the Gulf, now have quiet alliances with their one-time foe. Despite Ben-Gurion’s maxim, the celebrations in London and Jerusalem will be a reminder that Israel still craves moral affirmation. The then Lord Balfour saw Israel in emotional terms, a state owed to the Jews because of “age-old traditions and present needs.” That sentiment still looms large. Palestinians, for their part, call his letter the first of many betrayals by the world. Last year Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, threatened to sue Britain unless it recognised Palestine and apologised for the declaration. He has spent much of this decade trying to win international recognition; in a sense, he has become an unlikely heir to Mr Weizmann’s brand of Zionism. Palestine won observer status at the UN in 2012, and most countries in the world now recognise it as a state. Yet it is no closer to independence than it was in 1967. Mr Abbas’s corrupt, sclerotic government has spent much of the past decade feuding not with Israel but with its own people. Perhaps the Balfour Declaration has a lesson for the Palestinians as well: Britain did not create Israel—and nor will another foreign power create Palestine. If there is to be an end to a century of conflict, it will have to come from within."
https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/08/suella-braverman-uses-a-pro-palestinian-march-to-sow-discord,"Armistice day commemorates several things, none of which means that protests against Israel’s bombardment of Gaza should not take place on that day—and some of which suggest they should. Held every year on the anniversary of the truce that ended the first world war on November 11th 1918, Armistice Day remembers those who have died in service since 1914. It also celebrates a victory over forces that would have denied Britons vital freedoms, including the right to protest. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, nonetheless wants to stop a pro-Palestine march due to take place in London on November 11th. She has described it as a “hate march” that displays “thuggish intimidation and extremism”. If her words were intended to foment division, they have succeeded. Some far-right agitators have in recent days urged supporters to “defend” the Cenotaph, a monument to the war dead in central London. That may have prompted the Metropolitan Police to urge organisers of the march to cancel it. Yet on November 7th Sir Mark Rowley, the Met’s commissioner, also made it clear he would not bow to political pressure. The march did not pose enough of a threat of serious public disorder for him to seek a ban under the Public Order Act of 1986, he said. He stressed the importance of an “independent police service…focused simply on the law and the facts in front of us”. Sir Mark pointed out that the planned march’s route goes nowhere near the Cenotaph: it will begin at Hyde Park, about a mile away, and end at the American embassy in Vauxhall, south of the Thames. Armistice Day this year takes place a day before Remembrance Sunday, the main commemoration of Britain’s war dead, when a ceremony is held at the Cenotaph itself. One of the chief organisers of the march, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (psc), which was established in 1982 and has held largely peaceful marches for the past four Saturdays, has scheduled the demonstration to begin two hours after the two-minute silence on the morning of November 11th. The psc has also had regular meetings with the Met to discuss security. There are genuine concerns about rising anti-Semitism in Britain, as elsewhere. In London posters of hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th, when the terrorist group murdered 1,400 people, have been torn down. Some of the chants of those protesting against Israel’s bombing of Gaza are brazenly anti-Semitic. They include “From the river to the sea”, which is a call for the destruction of Israel, whether all those who repeat it understand that or not. The police do have powers to deal with hate-fuelled protesters. In addition to allowing the police to ask the government to ban a march, the Public Order Act also allows police to detain anyone who causes “harassment, alarm or distress”. The Met has already arrested several apparent supporters of Hamas, the political wing of which was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the government in 2021 (the military wing was proscribed in 2001). But Sir Mark has previously suggested that, although the law is clear on terrorism offences, there is “scope to be much sharper” on extremism. That was “creating a gap”. Looking to see whether laws need tightening up is reasonable. But curbing the right to protest is a mistake. Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians. Ms Braverman’s incendiary language has not been echoed by others in government. Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, said that the right to protest is “what makes us a fair and free country”. Yet he and other Tories have also urged the march not to go ahead. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, has said that Sir Mark would be held accountable for his decision. More conflict lies ahead. Pro-Palestinian activists seem unlikely to let up on protests. And in a piece for the Times this week, the home secretary doubled down, again branding demonstrators as “hate marchers” and accusing the police of being softer on protesters “favoured by the left”. The police have a hard enough job without Ms Braverman stirring the pot. ■ For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas,"IN THE EARLY hours of October 7th Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist organisation that runs Gaza, launched more than 2,000 rockets towards Israel. Over a thousand Hamas fighters, some in motorised gliders, crossed the border between Israel and Gaza. They attacked civilians on the streets of small Israeli towns and in their homes. In the next 48 hours they killed more than 900 Israelis, a figure far surpassing the deaths in the previous 19 years of conflict, and took around 150 hostages. Israel was caught off guard partly because Hamas had never carried out such a large attack. The country’s defence establishment had assumed that in recent years Hamas had decided to refrain from wide-scale confrontation—and that its capacity to do so was limited. They were wrong. Just how powerful is Hamas? Hamas was founded in 1987 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian cleric, during the first intifada, when thousands of Palestinians fought against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Yassin, who had joined the Muslim Brotherhood, the world’s oldest Islamist movement, in Cairo, intended Hamas to be the Brotherhood’s political spin-off in Gaza. In its first charter, published in 1988, the “Islamic Resistance Movement”—“HMS” are its initials in Arabic—proclaimed its duty to liberate Palestine from Israel, which it declared illegitimate. It carried out its first attacks on Israeli military targets in 1989 and formally established a military wing in the early 1990s. It expressed its opposition to the Oslo accords, which were aimed at establishing peace between Israel and the Palestinians, by carrying out suicide-bombings within Israel. Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas: At first the group was weak both politically and militarily. But its political strength among Palestinians grew. In 2006, a year after Israel withdrew from Gaza, Hamas won a majority of seats in a Palestinian election and later formed a new unity government with Fatah, its nationalist rival. In June 2007, after a brief civil war, it assumed sole control of Gaza, leaving Fatah to run the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank. In response Israel and Egypt imposed a suffocating blockade on the coastal strip in 2007, strangling its economy and in effect confining its people in an open-air prison. There have been no elections since. Hamas has run Gaza as an oppressive one-party state, leaving some Palestinians there disenchanted with its leadership. Nevertheless Palestinians widely consider it to be more competent than the ailing, corrupt PA. Despite the blockade, Hamas was able to slowly build its military capacity. By 2008, when the group began its first war against Israel, it had developed a military structure and trained thousands of fighters, with smuggled support from Iran, Syria and Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, and had been launching makeshift rockets for a year. But the rocket attacks achieved little militarily, and Israel’s subsequent strikes on Gaza killed an estimated 1,200-1,400 Palestinians. Hamas has innovated since then. In 2014, when it began its third war against Israel (after a second in 2012), it had a much wider range of combat capabilities. Its rockets had grown in number and range and it had got better at concealing its military infrastructure. It developed a system of offensive tunnels into Israel, and another through which it transported weapons from Egypt. It increased the efficiency of its ground combat forces, who continued fighting for 50 days. By 2021 Hamas was able to fire 4,300 rockets at Israel in an 11-day burst. (In 2014 it had fired around 4,500 in 50 days.) But Hamas was still no match for its foe. After its barrages in 2021 killed a dozen people, Israel’s retaliatory jets and helicopters pummelled an already decrepit Gaza, killing over 200. For two years Hamas avoided escalating the conflict with Israel. That led many to wrongly assume that the dominant forces within the group’s leaders were focusing on bolstering their rule in Gaza. But the attack on October 7th was far more sophisticated than any that came before it. Hamas attacked Israel’s sensors and disabled its security cameras. It made use of advanced electronic warfare and jammed Israeli communications systems, according to a report by Reuters. All this would suggest that Hamas has been bolstering its military technologies for some time, with at least some outside support, possibly from Iran. Hamas was able to launch its attack despite a huge asymmetry: Israel’s Defence Forces far outweigh it, in both numbers and equipment. Israel puts Hamas’s military force at about 30,000 fighters; Israel on Monday called up 300,000 reservists, to add to its 170,000 or so active soldiers. The IDF’s much larger arsenal includes missile boats and tanks. The 2m civilians in Gaza will be preparing for the worst. ■"
https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/06/24/labour-could-lose-a-by-election-over-the-issue-of-palestine,"GEORGE GALLOWAY is sitting in Starbucks, close to the abandoned nightclub that serves as his campaign base. “Fighting Labour is our number one target,” he declares. An MP for Labour before he was expelled in 2003, Mr Galloway is a political opportunist with a habit of causing trouble at tricky moments. He handed Labour surprise defeats in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005, and Bradford West in 2012. On July 1st, standing in Batley and Spen for a new Workers Party of Britain (founded to “defend the achievements of the USSR, China, Cuba etc”), he may cause a third upset, albeit by splitting Labour’s vote rather than by winning himself. Labour has held the seat since 1997. The candidate, Kim Leadbeater, is the sister of Jo Cox, who was its MP until she was murdered in 2016 by a white-supremacist terrorist. Ms Leadbeater’s energy, charisma and work for the foundation set up in her sister’s memory are in her favour. But polling suggests rising support for the Conservatives. And much of Mr Galloway’s projected 6% vote share is likely to come from South-Asian Muslims who feel slighted and ignored by Labour. The constituency is a complex mixture. The small, prosperous towns of Spen Valley largely vote Tory. Batley, by contrast, is an old mill town filled with working-class white and South-Asian Muslims. It is rundown, with many of the handsome sandstone buildings in the centre lying empty. Leave the centre, and cobbled streets give way to potholed tarmac. Locals complain about fly tipping, too few school places and the closure of Batley police station. Such gripes usually harm incumbents—and Labour holds not just the constituency but also a plurality on the county council. Ms Leadbeater joined Labour only recently (she felt that party membership conflicted with her charity work), which may help neutralise the anti-incumbency effect. But it has also stirred resentments. Some local Muslims think a Labour candidate should have been chosen from among their community’s councillors. Some of those councillors are rumoured to be campaigning for Mr Galloway. Inter-communal relations can be rocky. Residents, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, lament increasing self-segregation. Ms Cox was murdered by a white supremacist; far-right groups frequently demonstrate in the area and several are running in this election. In May a teacher at Batley Grammar School was forced into hiding by death threats after he showed a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad in a lesson on blasphemy. He is still in hiding. Internal Labour politics do not help. Sir Keir Starmer, the party’s leader, has tried to tackle the anti-Semitism that flourished under Jeremy Corbyn, his predecessor. But many of Batley’s Muslims feel he has nothing to say about their grievances, or about Islamophobia. They are angered, too, by his refusal to condemn Israel’s recent bombing of Gaza. All this is meat and drink to Mr Galloway, whose other pet cause, besides a fondness for anti-Western dictatorships, is Palestine. From 2012 to 2015 he was MP for nearby Bradford West, standing for the Respect Party, a coalition of far-left and Islamist groupuscules. He claims Muslims like him because he helped organise an aid convoy to Palestine in 2008-09, and more generally because of his pro-Palestinian stance and rhetoric. Doubtless true, but Mr Galloway also evokes uglier sentiments. He once blamed a scandal on the “New York-Tel Aviv axis of evil”. Some of his supporters talk of the “powerful lobbies” that made Sir Keir party leader. Soon the words “Jewish” and “Zionist” are uttered, along with references to politicians “selling their souls” on the issue of Palestine. Mr Galloway promises his supporters that a defeat for Labour in Batley and Spen will force Sir Keir to step down as party leader. That may be an exaggeration. But there is no doubt that another loss, after Labour’s shock defeat in a by-election in May in Hartlepool, which elected its first-ever Conservative MP, would seriously damage Sir Keir. Hartlepool was one of the “Red Wall” constituencies across the middle and north of England that used to vote Labour, but plumped for Brexit in 2016 and are now tilting Conservative. That loss emphasised how hard it will be for Labour to keep both the northern, pro-Brexit working class and the southern, anti-Brexit graduates it needs to have any chance in a general election. Losing Batley and Spen would be a sign that a modest but important part of Labour’s multi-ethnic coalition is also at risk. In this constituency and perhaps others, Israel, Palestine and anti-Semitism may function like Brexit: as a wedge issue that prises off one group of traditional Labour voters, stirring up dangerous divisions in the process. ■"
https://www.economist.com/letters/2006/08/24/on-joe-lieberman-israel-and-palestine-kazakhstan-hong-kong-women-and-men,"SIR – It was not only anti-war lefties and doves that gravitated away from Joe Lieberman in Connecticut's Democratic primary but also hawkish “Joe Biden” Democrats such as myself (“An anti-war centre begins to hold”, August 12th). I did admire Mr Lieberman for a long time, and he is by no means the only Democrat to think the Iraq war is the right course of action to take. However, his unapologetic support for George Bush's conduct of the war and the administration's violation of civil liberties and disregard for America's tradition in international justice (coupled with the fact that he buys into the Republican mantra that criticism of the government is unpatriotic) were just too much for most Democrats. Mr Lieberman needed to be put in check.  Michael Williams Head, Transatlantic Programme, Royal United Services Institute  London SIR – Your prescription for a solution to America's foreign policy problems in the Middle East asks the United States to put pressure on both Israel and the Palestinians to achieve peace (“Lost in the Middle East”, August 12th). The last time America tried this it came up with a comprehensive peace plan that was accepted by Israel and rejected by the Palestinians. Since then, Israel has withdrawn from Palestinian territories and elected a coalition government committed to further withdrawals. Meanwhile, the Palestinians have elected a government committed to destroying Israel. It seems that one party needs more pushing than the other, but if the Palestinians do not want a deal there will not be one. America needs European and Arab states to join it, seriously for once, in this effort.  Alex Pustilnik New York SIR – You highlighted the plight of the inhabitants of illegal settlements in Almaty (“The revolt in Almaty”, August 5th). The city's mayor faces a dilemma: on the one hand, property rights and the rule of law are a cornerstone of any free society, including Kazakhstan. On the other, the city authorities have a moral duty to provide, whether through public or private means, sufficient and adequate housing for the genuinely distressed inhabitants of the settlements. But this cannot be achieved overnight and the authorities are developing and publicly discussing plans to this end. The problem is not easy to resolve and it was therefore unhelpful that your article played the “ethnic card” with respect to the city's current and previous mayors. Ethnicity has nothing to do with this issue, rather it is about the growing pains of a fast-developing economy in a society that is in transition.  Erlan Idrissov Ambassador for Kazakhstan London SIR – You pointed out the desensitising nature of Hong Kong living (“Hard rain”, August 5th). One way to make Hong Kong more bearable is counterintuitive: build higher. Relaxing the maximum height restrictions would allow more green areas at street level. Alas, the city's laissez-faire tradition will be used as an excuse to do nothing.  Martin Lodge Hong Kong SIR – Thanks for an entertaining article on the objects that can come flying down on pedestrians from buildings in Hong Kong. My favourite “from the skies” memory is of a letter that appeared in a Hong Kong newspaper: “I was walking through Wan Chai when some clot shat on me.” Wes Pedersen  Chevy Chase, Maryland SIR – Women may have benefited from the rise of technology and globalisation and the importance of emotional intelligence, empathy and communication in modern professional careers (“How women won the sex war”, August 5th). But surely The Economist would wish to give some credit to Western liberal democracy for the levelling of gender in public life. On this point, the most notable exponent at Harvard is not Larry Summers but Harvey Mansfield, long of the government department, who argues in his book, “Manliness”, that: “the entire enterprise of modernity...could be understood as a project to keep manliness unemployed. The goal of modern liberalism was the rational state, a state that completed the long-standing attempt at the rational control of nature and human life that began with Machiavelli and culminated with Hegel.” Who needs Gary Cooper when you've got the Department of Homeland Security? Paul Nielsen Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire SIR – It might interest you to know that not a single serious study has ever been able to demonstrate a link between “emotional intelligence” and leadership effectiveness. The most robust and consistent single predictor of leadership effectiveness is, simply, intelligence. Emotional intelligence sells well, but scientific evidence supporting it is almost as solid as that supporting the effectiveness of homeopathy. Erkko Autio Professor, department of management HEC Lausanne Lausanne, Switzerland SIR – A recent survey by an academic at Georgia Institute of Technology asked female scientists in tenure track positions what the most significant issue was that they faced. The overwhelming answer was juggling family and career. Developing research questions, managing students, supervising researchers, balancing budgets, filing reports and making deadlines were all of trivial concern compared with planning child care. Are these female PhDs too incompetent to find a solution? Or are they the ones primarily responsible for ensuring that their children are properly looked after? Ann Gallagher Bethesda, Maryland SIR – Only a man could fail to mention the real advantages that men have over women: an ambition for success, even at the cost of their own health; and a parasitic ability to utilise the domestic and child-care labour of their women without feeling guilt. Forget about empathy and emotional intelligence—they just get women sidelined into personnel departments. The only way to attain real power is really, really to want it and not to care about the cost. Hilary Potts London SIR – Or is it madam? As a male engineer, I read your thoughts on gender differences with new-found resolve. At work today, I had ample time to contemplate my impending obsolescence after switching on my computer so that it could set about the passé task of designing aircraft. In the past it was slide rules and T-squares that did this work, but the tremendous amount of muscle power needed to wield these instruments saved me from redundancy. Clearly, what I need to do to get ahead is to work on such social skills as going behind people's backs, staying angry for long periods of time and spreading bitchy rumours—teamwork and technical skills be damned.

https://www.economist.com/unknown/2005/07/28/history-in-brief,"The birth of the state of Israel was the fulfilment of the Zionist movement, conceived in the 19th century to create a homeland for Jews. Ancient Jews had scattered around the world following their conquest and occupation by the Romans and the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. In the 1880s Jews seeking escape from persecution in Europe began migrating en masse to Palestine, then an Arabic-speaking part of the Ottoman empire; by 1914 Palestine's Jewish population had more than doubled. In 1917, as British forces were despatching the Ottomans in the first world war, Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, stating support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine without “prejudice” to the rights of the Palestinian Arabs. After the war, Palestine was placed under a British mandate and, as Zionist immigration increased, violence flared between its Jewish and Arab communities. After the Holocaust, pressure grew for the international recognition of a Jewish state, and the UN proposed the partition of the Palestine mandate into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The Arab states rejected partition and invaded Palestine as soon as the British withdrew. On May 14th 1948, the state of Israel was declared, with David Ben-Gurion as its first prime minister. The Arab invasion was unsuccessful and more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs were expelled during the fighting. In 1949 Israel signed armistice agreements with its neighbours. However the Arab governments and the Palestinian refugees refused to recognise Israel's existence as a legitimate country. The region remained unstable. To prop up the beleaguered republic, the Jewish diaspora poured money into Israel, and in the late 1960s the United States became its principal financial and political supporter. Within a few years, the young country had developed an efficient agrarian and technological society, and further strengthened its military superiority over the surrounding Arab countries. Israel demonstrated its new might in 1956 when it invaded the Egyptian Sinai (with British and French collusion), after Egypt's nationalisation of the Suez Canal. American intervention forced Israel's withdrawal. War returned in 1967, when Egypt, Syria and Jordan massed forces to challenge Israel. In a pre-emptive strike, Israel smashed its enemies' forces in just six days and captured the West Bank, the Gaza strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai peninsula. As the Israeli government moved to build Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), led by Yasser Arafat, took the lead role in fighting the Israeli occupation. In October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack in the Sinai and the Golan Heights. The Israelis were not defeated but Arab honour was restored, paving the way for peace negotiations under American auspices. In 1979 Egypt signed a peace agreement with Israel, and in 1994 Jordan did the same. But only in the early 1990s, after years of intifada (popular uprising), did Israel and the Palestinians begin to speak of a peace process. Despite the establishment of a Palestinian Authority and the hand-over of parts of the West Bank and the Gaza strip to its control, Palestinian terrorism, Israel's harsh occupation policies, the accelerated construction of Jewish settlements, the plight of the refugees and the disputed status of Jerusalem all continued to block progress. A second, bloodier intifada began in 2000, and peace remains elusive. (For recent developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, see our backgrounder.)"
https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/03/12/apeirogon-depicts-a-moving-israeli-palestinian-friendship,"Apeirogon. By Colum McCann. Random House; 480 pages; $28. Bloomsbury; £18.99. COLUM MCCANN’S new novel refers at one point to the “Jerusalem Syndrome”: the messianic delusions that “proximity to the holy places” can induce in pilgrims to the city. Foreign writers and artists often display their own version of this mania. It consists in ordering the divided peoples of the Holy Land to recognise how much they have in common (in history, heritage, culture, even genetics) and instructing them to live in peace. Irish-born but long resident in New York, Mr McCann knows every pitfall that awaits the moralising traveller keen to swell the region’s “corny” and “trite” rhetoric “of justice, of kinship, of reconciliation”. From its mysterious title onwards, the oblique storytelling of “Apeirogon”, his seventh novel, shuns the conventions of the high-minded outsider’s reportage. Yet, for all his sophisticated artistry, the authority of this work of fiction rests ultimately on its truth. Mr McCann did not invent the entwined destinies of Bassam Aramin and Rami Elhanan. Rather, their real, conjoined lives inspired this “hybrid novel”, which weaves documentary and imagination into its toughly lyrical fabric. Both bereaved fathers, the pair of friends decided that “the only revenge is making peace”. Brought up in Hebron, Mr Aramin was a Fatah militant who served seven years in jail but soon set out “to pit himself against the ignorance of violence, including his own”. In 2007 an Israeli soldier killed his ten-year-old daughter Abir with a rubber bullet as she bought sweets in the West Bank town of Anata. Mr Elhanan is an Israeli whose father, a Holocaust survivor, immigrated from Hungary, but whose mother’s family had lived in Jerusalem for six generations. Hamas terrorists killed his 13-year-old daughter Smadar in 1997 in a suicide-bomb attack on the city’s Ben Yehuda Street. But he progressed from viewing Palestinians as threats from “the dark side of the moon” to acknowledging “the equality of pain”. First in Combatants for Peace (Mr Elhanan fought in three of Israel’s wars), then in the Parents Circle that brings together bereaved families from both sides, the duo have sought through their activism to replace the clear lines of enmity with “the tangle of knowing each other”. Journalists and film-makers have told their story before. Mr McCann, too, co-operated closely with the friends. “Apeirogon”, though, wraps the facts of their journeys, and their griefs, into an elliptical and fragmentary narrative. It situates their quest for hope within the art and landscape of Israel-Palestine and the “smashed jigsaw” of rival histories. “Geography here is everything,” Mr McCann writes. His mosaic of 1,001 colourful, enigmatic paragraphs range across the scenery of a military occupation that stifles the West Bank like “the rim of a tightening lung” and, for Palestinians, “deprives you of tomorrow”. The reader glimpses the men’s zigzag route through loss into peacemaking via vivid, jagged tesserae of prose. Meanwhile, images of flight, flux and movement—involving migratory birds, watercourses, artworks, even weaponised drones—offer a hawk’s, or dove’s, eye view of the seething cauldron that the novelised Mr Elhanan calls a “condensed everywhere”. An “apeirogon”, the geometric term that becomes Mr McCann’s key metaphor, is a shape “with a countably infinite number of sides”. The patchwork pattern of this novel matches the polyhedral complexity of the pasts it evokes. With “one story becoming another”, “Apeirogon” insists on “the sheer simultaneity of all things”. The results are frequently beautiful, sometimes baffling. The imagery often dazzles, but plainer passages that inhabit the men’s minds as they wrestle against rage and bitterness towards an “ethic of reciprocity” have the greatest emotional power. At the core of this fractal fiction is a simple, radiant myth: “The hero makes a friend of his enemy.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/pomegranate/2014/03/25/hope-through-architecture,"Jewish and Arab architects might one day share their heritage and skills NOT only in 2013 did the building of Jewish settlements on the West Bank, the core of a would-be Palestinian state, grow at twice the rate of 2012; its uniform architecture is increasingly attracting Palestinians. In place of their distinctive rough-hewn stone houses, Palestinian builders now tend to prefer the uniform style of red-roofed houses that mark out Israeli settlements. “People always look up to the colonial power, even if they resent it,” says Renad Shqeirat, a Palestinian architect and conservationist. “They see their architecture as a sign of modernisation.” It is increasingly hard to tell settler and new Palestinian housing estates apart by their style. Fuelled by high Jewish and Palestinian population growth and a facts-on-the-ground struggle to control as much territory as possible, the Jewish settlement of Har Homa on Jerusalem’s southern edge merges with the new estates of the once pastoral Palestinian village of Beit Sahour. One of Palestine’s biggest property developers, Bashar al-Masri, takes pride in building Palestine’s first “settlement”. He has dispensed with the traditional shape of a Palestinian village, which often cascades randomly down a West Bank hill, and has instead spent $1-billion-odd to plonk his new city on a hilltop, resembling the nearby Jewish settlements that dominate the surrounding Palestinian villages yet are disconnected from them. A new Israeli commuter city, Modi’in, served as a model. Mr Masri has called on Israelis seeking new flats to buy in his city in the cause of coexistence. Even the name he chose, Rawabi, is an Arabic translation of Maale, Hebrew for hilltop, which many Jewish settlements have as part of their name. Urbanisation is changing Palestinian landscape in other ways too. Where winding roads once mapped the West Bank’s meandering contours, Israeli highways between the settlements drive straight lines through the hills. Once a hallmark, terraces laden with vines and olive trees have long since been abandoned to weeds, as Palestinian smallholders leave their farms for Israeli construction sites. “Work in Israel has taken a whole generation away from the fields,” says John Ashley, a British agronomist based in Ramallah, the Palestinians’ administrative capital, north of Jerusalem. Attempting to reverse the tide, a Palestinian conservation association, Riwaq, is trying to reinstill Palestinians’ pride in their rural heritage. Launched in 1992, Riwaq recently unveiled a project to restore 50 of the 420 villages in the West Bank and Gaza. In an Ottoman house in Salfit, a town of 12,000 in the shadow of Ariel, one of the West Bank’s biggest Jewish settlements, Ms Shqeirat, one of Riwaq’s promoters, has torn down ugly concrete additions and used local material to restore arches, crannies and balconies. She has entrusted the building to a local women’s co-operative because “women look after buildings better than men”. It is a first step, she hopes, towards restoring Salfit’s charming but decrepit Ottoman quarter. With Swedish and Kuwaiti support, Riwaq has restored other old West Bank towns in their entirety, and turned forlorn old caravanserai into boutique hotels. “We’re slowly winning the war,” says Ms Shqeirat, optimistically. “We used to have to beg people to let us into their homes; now they are rushing to us and offering to pay.”"
https://www.economist.com/pomegranate/2014/03/20/a-gurgle-of-hope,"Will the Israelis allow the Palestinians to exploit their own oil? CONFIDENT of striking oil in the rocky hills of the West Bank, Palestine’s government is to tender a concession for exploration around Rantiss, a village north of Jerusalem near the armistice line that separated Palestinian territory from Israel in 1967. “We would net $1 billion over a decade,” says President Mahmoud Abbas’s economic adviser, Muhammad Mustafa, who expects to launch a tender imminently. He points to commercial production by an Israeli company, Givot Olam, which is drilling just inside Israel, tapping the same reservoir. But a series of obstacles dogs exploration, as Mr Mustafa, who is also Palestine’s deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, admits. Israel’s military administration, which oversees the West Bank, has not yet given approval for exploration, and the field, says Dror Etkes, an expert on Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank, lies inside an Israeli-declared military zone. Under Israeli-Palestinian agreements dating back two decades, Israel exercises full control over the predominantly rural swathe of the West Bank known as Area C, which accounts for 62% of the occupied territory (excluding the Gaza Strip). Israeli hardliners are pressing to annex Area C, which includes Rantiss. Some Israeli officials also fear that an influx of capital into Palestine would empower it in its struggle against Israel’s occupation. Israel has impeded the development of a gasfield in a bigger concession off Gaza’s coast that the Palestinian authorities awarded to British Gas over a decade ago. A World Bank report estimated in October last year that Palestine’s economy would soar by a third if it were able to exploit Area C and other riches offshore. Mr Mustafa’s decision to explore Area C without Israeli approval may bolster a Palestinian campaign to recover the territory’s raw materials and to develop its agriculture, both of which Israel has exploited for the past 45 years. A host of Western powers, including the so-called Quartet that groups together the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, have given the Palestinians their support. The Quartet’s representative, Tony Blair, a former British prime minister, has prepared an eight-point plan to spend $12 billion to regenerate the Palestinian economy, with an emphasis on tourism, farming and the mineral exploitation of Area C. But without the Israeli military administration granting easier access and permits, the Palestinians’ oil is unlikely to flow soon."
https://www.economist.com/letters/2012/07/14/on-london-palestine-hypoxia-currency-super-sizing-repetition,"Capital gains  SIR – You were unduly dismissive of the Green Belt in your special report on London (“On a high”, June 30th). Vivid Economics, a consultancy, has recently shown that the true value of the Green Belt is not properly understood. It is a working landscape combining a range of environmental services, such as woodland cover, public footpaths and agricultural production (particularly salad crops), while mostly retaining its rural beauty. There is enough brownfield land in London (with more in surrounding regions) to provide 400,000 new homes. Without the Green Belt London would have gone the way of many other cities and become a car-choked, sprawling morass with large areas of redundant suburbs. That’s why other great world cities, such as Seoul and Toronto, now also have Green Belts of their own. Paul MinerSenior planning officer Campaign to Protect Rural EnglandLondon  SIR – Your article on London’s infrastructure echoed the claim of BAA, which owns Heathrow, that a city can have only a single airport “hub”. The implication is that without a third runway, London faces inexorable decline. But Moscow, Tokyo and New York all have two hub airports. Hubs need critical mass and good connectivity. BAA, as the owner of Gatwick and Stansted as well, made sure that it did not create any rivals. Indeed, by encouraging budget airlines to dominate these airports, and only half-heartedly promoting improvements to rail links and runway capacity, it made it difficult for a new hub to emerge. One surely will now the monopoly is being broken. Gatwick is constrained to a single runway for another decade, but with a link into Crossrail, Stansted could rival Heathrow. There is room for four runways, with a tiny fraction of the impact at Heathrow. And, unlike the proposed airport in the Thames Estuary, people live nearby so they could work there. Michael SchabasLondon  SIR – London “subsidises the rest of the country to the tune of £15 billion each year”, you said. Have you considered that London’s “subsidy” might be the result of centuries of siphoning off the wealth created by the rest of Britain? I don’t seem to recall reading much about London’s contribution to the industrial revolution, and I’m pretty certain our offshore oil industry isn’t in the Thames Estuary. What London has contributed recently is the transformation of wealth earned elsewhere into a London property boom, leading in turn to the present real-world crisis created by the unreal world of London’s financial centre. Francis ToolisDumfries, Scotland  * SIR – The concentration of company headquarters in London arises mostly from the desire of the few top people to be “in town”. With modern communications there is no real need for them to be there. In fact, very many large foreign companies avoid the area and its associated high costs. When I worked in Germany, London was referred to as the Romania of the then Common Market. Having worked in Romania, I could agree. By a fluke of timing your special report appeared in the same week that Vince Cable called the City a ""cesspit"". He was a little off mark: a cesspit can be cleaned out. A better analogy would be an inoperable cancer. Eric Evans Dorchester, Dorset SIR – Your special report was a thinly veiled manifesto for a unilateral declaration of independence for London. As a new independent global city state, joining Singapore and Dubai, and soon to be joined by Shanghai and others, London would be controlling its own destiny at the centre of a future club of truly global nations. Kieran SheedyLondon  SIR – On many occasions I have had people mention to me, in passing, their dislike of immigrants: from foreign consultants in hospitals to foreign cleaners. The sad irony is that I am an immigrant, but in their eyes I don’t count—I am white and speak English (albeit with a North American twang). These people aren’t anti-immigration. They are racist, plain and simple, and the media need to label it appropriately. Only then can politicians be free to deal with immigration sensibly. Carolyn GibsonBirmingham SIR – You criticised Londoners for their curmudgeonly attitude to the rich, bankers and immigrants—“those on whom London depends”—with no analysis as to why some might feel discomfort. Few of us live in the gilded cage of the outer-national and, in spite of our inclinations to welcome the world’s brightest and best to our respective countries, is it unreasonable to expect one’s guests not to leave with the silver? Matthew IngramLondon Palestine and the UAE * SIR – In your article on Palestine (“The calm may not last for ever”, June 30th) you said that cash donations to the Palestinian Authority from the United Arab Emirates have dwindled because their government “seems to have sided with [Muhammad] Dahlan”, a supposed rival to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. The UAE has thankfully always been supportive. We in the prime minister’s office remain confident that it will continue to support the Palestinian Authority, both financially and politically, without regard to internal Palestinian politics. Ghassan KhatibOffice of the Prime MinisterThe Palestinian Authority Nutrient pollution  SIR – Your article on the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia noted the potential of the “world’s largest water-quality trading programme” (“Blooming horrible”, June 23rd). However because of the way trading programmes are implemented in America it will do little for the Gulf. Federal law imposes nutrient limits only on point sources, like municipal waste-water-treatment plants. When point-source limits are enforced, credit trading allows those sources to comply by buying nutrient reductions. Farmers are hoped to be the preferred seller. Yet point sources contribute only about 10% of the total nitrogen load to the Gulf. Most agricultural operations face no federal requirements but contribute most of the pollution. Cracking down on the point sources with mandatory caps will make, at best, a small dent in the problem. Promoting the idea that farmers will be customers for point sources is an unfortunate diversion from the real challenge of radically reducing run-off. Kurt StephensonDepartment of Agricultural and Applied EconomicsVirginia Tech Leonard ShabmanResident scholar Resources for the FutureWashington, DC Big notes, small change SIR – There was truth in your article on currency (“My money is bigger than yours”, June 23rd). I recall numerous “beach boys” begging on the popular beaches of India in the 1970s. They would rush first to foreigners, mostly Americans, for dimes and quarters (no hint of numerical value there) or an occasional dollar bill. But the most sought-after were the generous Italians for their highly denominated lire. The poor beggar-boys would hand over their day’s collection to a black-market dealer who would give them a few local coins and a quick lesson in foreign rates of exchange. Rajan MahadevanSassofortino, Italy Go large  SIR – Surely there’s enough obesity-related disease around to justify Michael Bloomberg’s ban on buckets of soda (Lexington, June 9th), even if it is a “top-down” approach? Recently, while driving, I stopped for a “small” coke. I was handed a huge cup and told that every soda was one dollar. Not only did I fill it up, but I then drank five times the amount I wanted while reproaching myself for not having the resolve to reject such a “bargain”. Our guts and brains have been hijacked and we should welcome any attempt to chip away at the deleterious super-sizing mania. Paula MaterreWondervu, Colorado Bit between the teeth  SIR – Your use of the words “bit” and “bits” is a bit much. In a recent issue you went a bit too far with three “bits” in the same article (“Shaming the unshameable”, June 16th). A useful bit of the computer—edit, find—can help you avoid these bits of excess. That’s my two bits worth. Lynne FarrMountain View, Hawaii * Letter appears online only"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2013/07/06/talks-about-talks,"“TRUST us,” say the Americans seeking an Israeli-Palestinian agreement leading to two states. But few people do. John Kerry, the American secretary of state, has little to show for shuttling around the region in five trips in the past three months. Deadlines for relaunching talks have come and gone. Israelis, in particular, feel they have little reason to move. Things are pretty calm at home. Political violence by Palestinians is rare. By contrast, the Arab world is in turmoil. Mr Kerry’s visits hardly get mentioned in the Israeli news. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is more sensitive to noises on his boisterous right flank than to those on the doveish left. He remembers that Jewish settlers on the West Bank, abetted by religious nationalists, brought an end in 1999 to his first stint as prime minister, after he had sought to mollify America by withdrawing settlers from bits of the Palestinian territories. Now the settlers there are even stronger. Their firebrands are winning plum jobs in Mr Netanyahu’s party. In response to Mr Kerry’s suggestions for getting talks started again, the Israelis have spent weeks arguing over how many dozen Palestinian prisoners to release among several thousand and in what stages. “These details are obscuring the bigger picture,” says a frustrated Palestinian negotiator. When the Palestinians return to the UN in New York in September with a fresh bid to upgrade their status there, the Americans may hesitate before using their veto again; last time, embarrassingly, only eight countries joined them. And if talks continue to go nowhere the Europeans may be considering whether to stop paying for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which runs the West Bank under Israel’s eye, perhaps even causing it to collapse. A senior Palestinian official says he expects a third intifada (uprising) to break out in due course, possibly targeting the Palestinian leadership. Some Arab officials still hope that Mr Netanyahu may yet keep the ball in play by promising in principle to withdraw from most of the West Bank occupied by Israel after the war of 1967. That might conceivably be enough to let Mahmoud Abbas, the PA’s president, return to the table. Mr Netanyahu has aired the prospect of a smaller “interim” Palestinian state. But Mr Abbas fears that, if he accepted that idea, it would allow Israel’s settlers to gobble up the rest for good. If Mr Kerry gave up, would hopes for a two-state solution die? One regional idea has outlived all the others: the Arab Peace Initiative unveiled in Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, in 2002. Since endorsed by 57 Muslim governments, including Iran’s, it offers to recognise Israel once it withdraws from the territory it captured in 1967 and deals with the plight of Palestinian refugees. Israeli politicians across the political spectrum recently debated the Arab initiative in a side hall of their parliament. Nine Arab foreign ministers have publicly stated, in Mr Kerry’s presence, that they would go still further and accept modifications to Israel’s borders with land swaps, implicitly letting the bulk of the Jewish settlements, which are close to the old 1967 border, stay within an expanded Israel. Questioning the Arab world’s long-standing policy of barring contact with Israel, an Arab dignitary recently suggested asking Mr Netanyahu to attend a secret Arab League meeting in Amman, capital of neighbouring Jordan. Another proposed a “roadshow” of Arabs and Israelis touring the region together. Others discuss how they might gradually normalise ties with Israel, as Israel normalises its own with the Palestinians. If the Israeli authorities would let Palestinian pilgrims have unfettered access to shrines in Jerusalem, Arab states could—it has been suggested—give Israelis equally unfettered access to Jewish shrines in the Arab world, such as that of the Prophet Ezekiel in Iraq, whence many Israelis stem. “The Arab world has crossed the Rubicon, and moved from a platform of war to peace,” says a former senior Saudi official, who contemplates contacts with Israel. “But we’re waiting for Israel to respond.”"
https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/02/narendra-modi-has-shifted-india-from-the-palestinians-to-israel,"FOREIGN NEWS usually gets short shrift in India. Yet for the past month the country’s television channels have been dominated by wall-to-wall coverage of events in Israel and Gaza, mostly from Israel’s perspective. News anchors in bulletproof vests stand in the desert delivering breathless reports on the aftermath of Hamas’s atrocities in Israel on October 7th. Talk-show hosts restage the Palestinian terrorist group’s attack from Gaza with toy soldiers and miniature bulldozers. Weeks into the war, coverage remains intense. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas The media’s fascination with Israel’s plight and retribution coincides with a marked shift in the Indian government’s stance on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. It has moved from backing the Palestinians to more or less unqualified support for Israel. The pivot is based on a realist reappraisal of Indian interests in the Middle East. It has also met with strong public backing from Narendra Modi’s domestic supporters, which is gratifying for Mr Modi’s government ahead of state elections this month and a general election next year. In the past, like many countries in the global south, India tempered any expression of support for Israel with expressions of concern for the Palestinians’ plight. No more. Mr Modi took to X (formerly Twitter) within hours of Hamas’s assault to express his horror at the “terrorist attacks” and declare that “we stand in solidarity with Israel”. It took five days for India’s Ministry of External Affairs to reiterate, in response to questions from reporters, that India continued to support a two-state solution to the conflict. On October 27th, in a departure from its usual voting record, India abstained as the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza; it objected that the text did not condemn Hamas’s assault. The shift reflects India’s growing defence and commercial ties to Israel. Co-operation between the two countries has been deepening ever since Israel provided India with military help during the Kargil war against Pakistan in 1999. That was long before America took a serious interest in military co-operation with India. Over the past decade India has bought missiles, drones and border-security equipment (and probably surveillance software, though it has not admitted this) from Israel, making it the Israeli defence industry’s biggest foreign customer. A bromance between Mr Modi and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has deepened the relationship. So has the two countries’ shared preoccupation with fighting terrorism, especially the Islamist variant. Explaining the abstention in the UN vote, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, said in a speech on October 29th that India took a strong position on terrorism “because we are big victims of terrorism”. India has also been increasing its ties with Gulf Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And it can ill afford to alienate them; it depends on them for much of its oil and goodwill towards an estimated 9m expatriate Indian workers. Yet the fact that both countries have recently moved closer to Israel has allowed Mr Modi to effect his shift with alacrity. Even in the current crisis, the Saudis and Emiratis appear reluctant to allow the events in Gaza to cause a rupture in their long-term rapprochement with Israel. Domestically, the Modi government’s pivot is essentially all upside. The Congress-led opposition has condemned it; leaders of India’s 200m Muslims have heavily criticised Israel’s military response. Yet the Indian middle-class that mostly backs Mr Modi is especially concerned about Islamist terrorism. Its members look on Hamas’s attack and recall the tragedy Mumbai suffered in 2008, when Pakistani Islamists killed 175 people and wounded more than 300 during a four-day rampage. It included an attack on a Jewish community centre in the city, where the terrorists murdered the rabbi and his pregnant wife. There is a small risk the government will overplay its hand. As the civilian death toll in Gaza rises, India’s Arab partners might turn against the Israelis and their backers more aggressively. Mr Modi has latterly hedged against that possibility. He has reached out to Palestinian leaders, offering Indian condolences and humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, his Hindu-nationalist henchmen are unrestrained in using the conflict to stoke the Islamophobia that has propelled their party’s rise. Even if Mr Modi’s pivot becomes difficult abroad, it will probably help him win elections.■ Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia: South Korean politics is one big row about history (Oct 26th)India-Pakistan relations are becoming more marginal and worse (Oct 19th)Pakistan expels undocumented Afghans.

https://www.economist.com/news/2005/02/09/a-chronology-of-the-middle-east-conflict," 1917: In the Balfour Declaration, Britain expresses its support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”, though without prejudicing its non-Jewish communities. 1920: Britain takes over the administration of Palestine, Transjordan (later renamed Jordan) and Mesopotamia (Iraq), following the defeat of the Ottoman empire in the first world war.  1923: Britain cedes the Golan Heights from Palestine to French-run Syria. Britain's official mandate over Palestine, from the League of Nations, comes into effect.  1936: A three-year Arab revolt begins, amid frustration at rising Jewish immigration and continued colonial rule. 1939: Britain imposes restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine. 1945: At the end of the second world war, America urges Britain to lift its restrictions on Jewish refugees settling in Palestine but Britain resists this pressure. 1946: The King David Hotel, Britain's military headquarters in Jerusalem, is bombed by a Jewish militant group, Irgun. 1947: Britain asks the recently formed United Nations to take over the Palestine problem. The UN proposes partition. The Arabs reject this. 1948: The state of Israel is proclaimed. Neighbouring Arab states invade it. Israel's nascent defence forces repel them. Around 700,000 Arabs flee. Though Egypt ends up occupying the Gaza strip and Transjordan takes East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Israel ends up bigger than the UN partition plan had proposed.  1956: Egypt nationalises the Suez Canal and closes off access to the Israeli port of Eilat. Israel, France and Britain form a secret pact to attack Egypt. Under American pressure, they are forced to withdraw. 1964: Arab leaders create the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), whose founding charter calls for a Palestinian Arab state encompassing the whole of British Mandate Palestine and declares the establishment of Israel “illegal and null and void”. 1967: After Egypt masses its troops in the Sinai desert and blockades Eilat, the six-day war is launched and won by Israel. Sinai and the Gaza strip are taken from Egypt; the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan; and the Golan Heights from Syria. The PLO moves to Jordan. The UN passes Resolution 242, calling among other things for Israeli forces to withdraw from “territories occupied in the recent conflict” (a phrase whose precise meaning still provokes fierce debate) in return for Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist peacefully. The Arab League issues its “three noes”: no peace with Israel, no negotiations with Israel, no recognition of Israel. 1969: America launches the Rogers plan, which reiterates Resolution 242's land-for-peace formula. Both sides reject it. 1970: In what becomes known as “Black September”, Jordan expels the PLO after it creates a “state within a state” and hijacks American, Swiss, Israeli and British planes, holding some passengers hostage. The PLO eventually re-establishes itself in Lebanon, from where it launches raids on Israel.  1973: The Yom Kippur war: attacks by Egypt and Syria on Judaism's holiest day take Israel by surprise but it strikes back and its troops cross the Suez Canal and enter Syria before the UN calls for a ceasefire.  1977: Egypt's President Anwar Sadat becomes the first Arab leader to go to Israel, visiting Jerusalem to seek a peace settlement. 1978: After terrorist attacks on buses in northern Israel, its forces launch an incursion into Lebanon to attack PLO bases. America's President Jimmy Carter hosts the Camp David talks between Israel and Egypt. 1979: Israel and Egypt sign a peace deal, in which Israel returns the Sinai to Egypt. 1981: A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon-based Palestinian militants is brokered by an American envoy, Philip Habib, but lasts less than a year. 1982: Israel invades Lebanon. The PLO moves to Tunisia. America sends peacekeeping troops to Lebanon. It also launches the Reagan plan, proposing self-government for the West Bank and Gaza, though in association with Jordan rather than as an independent state. Israel, followed later by the PLO and Jordan, reject it. Up to 2,000 Palestinians are killed by Lebanese Christian militiamen allied to Israel in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps.  1983: A suicide bomber kills 241 American marines, sailors and soldiers in their base in Beirut.  1985: Most Israeli troops are withdrawn from Lebanon, except for a border “security zone”. 1987: Palestinians launch the first intifada (“struggle” or “shaking-off”) against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza. The clashes continue into the early 1990s. 1988: America launches the Shultz plan, incorporating elements of earlier peace proposals. The PLO issues a statement renouncing terrorism and recognising Israel's right to exist, leading America to open direct talks with the PLO. Jordan renounces its claim to sovereignty over the West Bank in favour of the PLO.  1991: After the first Gulf war ends, America launches the Madrid peace conference, with Israel holding its first formal negotiations with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestinian representatives (though not the PLO).  1993: Secret talks begin in Oslo between Israeli academics and PLO officials, leading to the Oslo accords. These propose an interim Palestinian Authority (PA), conducting limited self-government in part of the occupied territories, and a phased plan leading to a permanent peace settlement. 1994: The PLO's chairman, Yasser Arafat, returns from exile to the occupied territories. Israel and Jordan sign a peace treaty. 1995: Israel and the PLO sign the Oslo II agreement, under which Israel hands over security responsibility to the Palestinian Authority in parts of the occupied territories.  1998: Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, sign the Wye River memorandum, which aims to clarify the Oslo II agreement and set a timetable for its implementation. 1999: After slippage in the implementation of the Oslo accords, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Arafat sign the Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum, setting a new timetable, in talks hosted by Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. 2000: Talks at Camp David between Mr Barak and Arafat end in failure. Israel's opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, makes a provocative visit to Temple Mount in Jerusalem—known to Muslims as the “noble sanctuary”, one of their holiest places. Incensed, Palestinian militants launch a second intifada. President Bill Clinton hastily calls another summit at Sharm el-Sheikh, which reaches an agreement “to return the situation to that which existed prior to the current crisis”. A fact-finding commission headed by George Mitchell, an American former senator, is set up. Amid attacks from Lebanese militants, Israel pulls out of its “security zone” in southern Lebanon, as Mr Barak had promised the previous year. 2001: Between George Bush taking office as American president and Ariel Sharon winning the Israeli election, Israeli and Palestinian delegations hold talks at Taba in Egypt. But Mr Sharon refuses to talk peace while terrorist attacks continue, and the Oslo process stops. The Mitchell commission produces its report but it fails to make much impact. Mr Bush then sends the CIA chief, George Tenet, to the region. He produces another report proposing a ceasefire.  2002: After several Palestinian suicide bombings, Mr Sharon launches Operation Defensive Shield, seizing areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, which Israel accuses of failing to stop militants' attacks. Most of the West Bank and Gaza comes under siege as Israeli forces close down the areas. The Quartet group (America, the European Union, Russia and the UN) launches the “road map”, a new phased plan for peace, including the creation of an independent Palestine. Mr Bush calls for new Palestinian leadership in place of Arafat.  2003: Under pressure from the Quartet, Arafat hands much of his power to Mahmoud Abbas, a moderate, who becomes Palestinian prime minister. Mr Bush gets Mr Abbas and Mr Sharon to shake hands on the road map. The Palestinian militant groups agree among themselves a fragile ceasefire. But it collapses after only seven weeks: after a Hamas suicide bomber kills 22 people on a Jerusalem bus, Israel resumes its “targeted killings” of militant groups' political leaders. Mr Abbas resigns and his place is taken by Ahmed Qurei, another moderate, though closer to Mr Arafat.  2004: Mr Sharon unveils a controversial proposal to evacuate all Jewish settlements in the Gaza strip. After a suicide bombing kills ten in the Israeli port of Ashdod, Israel steps up its attacks on Palestinian militants and kills Hamas's spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. Arafat dies in a Paris hospital and Mr Abbas is named his successor as PLO leader.  2005: Palestinians elect Mr Abbas to succeed Arafat as PA president. At a summit with Mr Sharon in Sharm el-Sheikh, both men declare a ceasefire."
https://www.economist.com/pomegranate/2014/09/01/will-they-wont-they-join-the-dance,"HAMAS, the Islamist movement that Israel has been clobbering in Gaza, now says it would back the Palestinian Authority (PA) under Mahmoud Abbas if he were to bid to join the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague. The court could then investigate whether war crimes had been committed during the recent war in Gaza—by Israeli forces or by Palestinian ones. The PA has long threatened to join the court, but it is still not sure to do so. Joining it carries risks for the Palestinians—and for the court itself. Ever since the ICC was founded in 2002, it has suffered because of its limited powers and jurisdiction. It depends on its member states to carry out arrests. It can open investigations only in countries that have signed its treaty, or that invite it in; Israel has done neither. Alternatively, though the UN Security Council may tell the court to open an investigation anywhere, the United States has said it would veto any such proposal for Gaza. In 2009, when Mr Abbas asked the ICC to investigate allegations of war crimes by Israel during its war in Gaza in 2008-09, the court’s prosecutor refused to do so because Palestine was not then recognised by the UN as a state. That changed in 2012, when the UN General Assembly voted Palestine an “observer state”. Most international lawyers reckon that if the Palestinians applied to join the ICC now, they would get in. The court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, implied as much when she invited them to submit a new request by August 5th, when met the Palestinian foreign minister, Riad al-Malki (pictured leaving the court). But Palestinian accession would not mean that Israeli officials would face trial soon. The court generally take years investigating cases before issuing indictments, and the prosecutor’s hands are currently full. So long as Israel controls access to Gaza, the ICC would find it hard to carry out investigations there. In any case, Israel’s allies, not just America, oppose a Palestinian move to join the court, arguing that joining it would upset peace negotiations. If the court wades into Gaza, some Western governments might refuse to pay for its budget or even to uphold some of its decisions. And not all Palestinians are itching to join: since Hamas has fired thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets, it would be vulnerable to indictments, too. Yet some people at the ICC think Palestinian accession—and the opening of an investigation into Gaza—would help the ICC to fend off accusations that it prosecutes only Africans, who comprise all current indictees; since the court was set up, only two people, both African, have been convicted. “They’ve got to get out of Africa,” says Guénaël Mettraux, a lawyer who has defended suspects before the court."

But to trumpet this mighty yet flawed behemoth in an associated leader as “Asia's new model company” was a leap too far. Last year you averred: “it's time to stop coddling the all-conquering chaebol” (“The chaebol conundrum”, April 3rd 2010) and in an accompanying report offered a balanced and critical appraisal of Korean conglomerates and of Samsung in particular (“Return of the overlord”). Now, alas, you have joined the coddlers. What has changed? Not the chaebol. Ahn Chul-soo, a Korean IT entrepreneur and political sensation, calls them zoos, where employees are caged animals, and accuses them of “squeezing small companies for every penny.” Even President Lee Myung-bak, himself a former chief executive at Hyundai, has chided the chaebol for stifling start-ups. You also seemed to make light of Samsung's Byzantine governance. Yet third-generation hereditary succession is as grotesque at Samsung as in Pyongyang. Lee Jae-yong will inherit a company bigger than North Korea, but by what right? Koreans are asking that question; it was a shameful lapse that you did not. Aidan Foster-CarterHonorary senior research fellow in sociology and modern KoreaLeeds University A view on Palestine  SIR – Charlemagne (September 24th) was right to argue that European leaders should support Palestine's application to the UN. The Palestinian Authority has worked hard to demonstrate that Palestine is worthy of statehood. Huge progress, unimaginable in the Arafat era, has been made. Palestinian forces have ensured that all cities in the West Bank are terrorist-free, and the vast majority of Palestinians have no desire to return to violence, despite the siren voice of Hamas. I witnessed all this at first hand as the senior British army officer responsible for assisting the PA in reforming security between 2007 and 2009. These positive developments are very much in Israel's interests too. General Gavriel Ashkenazi, commander of the Israeli Defence Forces at the time, put it in a military context when he stated that, “as the Palestinians do more, so will we do less” It is unfortunate that Binyamin Netanyahu seems unable to endorse publicly what his own officials readily admitted to me. Brigadier (Retired) John DeverellLondon The ITU matters  SIR – The suggestion that the International Telecommunication Union cannot foster innovation (“In praise of chaos”, October 1st) is at odds with the fact that our technical standards remain the foundation of the seamless interconnections between fixed, wireless, satellite and fibre-optic networks on which the internet depends. The ITU's innovations, developed by our industry members, include xDSL, which is the basis of most fixed broadband connections, HDTV, mobile broadband (3G), optical networks and the H.264 video-coding standard used by YouTube, Blu-ray, smartphones, tablets, etc. Not bad for a “classic example of a sluggish international bureaucracy with antiquated diplomatic rituals.” And although the ITU's members will be reviewing international telecommunication regulations, there is no basis for the claim that any of them intends to pursue an agenda that would see the ITU “take over the running of the internet” (“A plaything of powerful nations”, October 1st). The ITU, as an impartial organisation, neither seeks nor supports such a move. Hamadoun TouréSecretary-general of the ITUGeneva Not FTT * SIR – The analysis you provided of the European Union's proposed financial-transaction tax, or FTT, was acute (“The blizzard from Brussels” October 1st). Not only is this proposal unlikely to achieve its policy aims; more importantly, the commission's own impact assessment suggests that overall, FTT would reduce economic growth and employment in Europe. It is not hard to see why. FTT would raise the cost of capital for firms. It would penalise end users of financial services, from industrial companies to pension funds. And it would place Europe's financial sector at a competitive disadvantage: the commission speculates that up to 90% of the derivatives business could move overseas. AFME represents the leading participants in Europe's financial markets. We understand that Europe's policymakers face a difficult balancing act in promoting recovery, reducing public deficits, stabilising the financial sector and defending the euro. We support their efforts. However, we are in no doubt that imposing a financial transaction tax in Europe would be deeply counterproductive, making economic recovery and financial stability harder to achieve. Simon LewisChief executiveAssociation for Financial Markets in EuropeLondon* SIR – The science of fluid dynamics teaches us that viscosity has a stabilising effect on flows that would otherwise be turbulent. With daily gyrations of the financial markets adding and subtracting untold billions of nominal worth and inducing corresponding shocks on the real economy, a little viscosity in the form of a small transaction tax seems a reasonable price to pay for a bit more stability in the system. Marc HerantLincoln, Massachusetts On liberty  SIR – Your assertion that utilitarians cannot respect the moral rights of individuals is not wholly accurate (“Goodness has nothing to do with it”, September 24th). It is perhaps true that Jeremy Bentham's principle of “the greatest happiness of the greatest number” as the foundation of morality is too callous. But John Stuart Mill refined the doctrine a generation later, advancing the idea of an individual's right to personal liberty as absolute and not to be interfered with by others. Therefore, a utilitarian could not in his good conscience “push the fat guy off” the railway bridge, as you put it, to save the lives of other men. This also negates your assumption that utilitarianism automatically gives politicians a free hand to trample on the rights of particular members of society, suspected terrorists say. In any case, it is only fair that you avoid lumping Mill together with those who seek to make inappropriate use of society's chubbier citizens in order to cut the financial cost of rail-safety improvements. Joe KearinsNorthampton The coming Russian winter  SIR – Your article discussing the shape of a Putin presidency said that the Kremlin often defends its actions “by pointing to the ‘mindlessness' of Russians and the lack of a strong civil society” (“Guess who!”, October 1st). Unfortunately, this is largely correct. The great majority of Russians display no interest in politics, for they regard all politicians, at home as well as abroad, as crooks. How politicians get themselves elected and how they rule is of little or no interest to Russians, as long as they protect them from domestic and foreign enemies. This mentality enables their rulers to act with impunity under the guise of “managed democracy” and bodes ill for Russia's future. Richard PipesCambridge, Massachusetts Don't look to Turkey * SIR – As you say, with her marred human-rights record Turkey cannot be a credible role model for countries experiencing the Arab spring (“A flawed example”, September 24th). Turkey has the highest number of journalists (57), members of parliament (6) mayors (dozens) and political prisoners (thousands) in jail. It is the only member of NATO that forbids a language (Kurdish) that is spoken by 15-20m people to be taught in schools. Somebody should remind Recep Tayyip Erdogan that people who live in s glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Nuri AkgulNew York Losing Jobs  SIR – Thank you for acknowledging the aspect of Steve Jobs's life that made him an icon in my eyes (“The magician”, October 8th). Long before Apple stores and iPods there was a man “who liked to see himself as a hippy, permanently in revolt against big companies”. That such a man, in faded blue jeans and a T-shirt (much less a man who dropped out of college only to drop acid), could become a corporate success meant that my youthful optimism was not simply naive. You sold this man short, however, by describing his life as an inspiration only to businesspeople. I have yet to meet a person of any vocation who is not genuinely moved by his 2005 commencement speech. Delia StoryTempe, Arizona  SIR – Surely a little bit of perspective is needed on Steve Jobs. The world is a big place. He managed successfully to sell some overpriced toys to a comparatively small number of wealthy people in industrialised nations who could afford to play with them. What is the big accomplishment in that? Hermann KaiserBerlin Power and language * SIR – Whoever came up with the headline “Reducing the barnacle bill” (September 3rd) should be given a raise. But there is such a thing as being too clever. In the article, you wrote: “France lost. The British empire became the global superpower of the 19th century. And the world speaks English, not French.” Although Britain was indeed the superpower, the international language continued to be French throughout the 19th century, and longer. English did not really become the global language until after the two world wars in the 20th century, and this trend accelerated with the rise of online culture. As late as the end of the 1960s, when I had finished high school and was considering a career in science, the advice of my teachers was to learn German. Don SiegelParis Opposites attract  SIR – One of your readers doesn't like the use of oxymorons in your newspaper (Letters, September 17th). And yet contradictory terms have become ingrained in the vernacular of economists. Professional dismal scientists have noted recently that “negative growth” is explained by “toxic assets”, but this will ultimately lead to “creative destruction”.

https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/24/as-a-pause-in-fighting-begins-husam-zomlot-calls-for-a-comprehensive-ceasefire,"THIS IS A defining moment, not only for Palestine, Israel and the broader Middle East, but for the international order and the world. The idea voiced in a recent Economist editorial that “a ceasefire is the enemy of peace” and would benefit Hamas is shocking and betrays an alarming lack of policy foresight and moral clarity. A comprehensive ceasefire—lasting in nature, unlike the pause for hostage releases that began today—would benefit peace. It would first benefit Palestinian civilians, who have endured unimaginable suffering in recent weeks. It would stop the spread of hostilities in the region. And it would open up a historic opportunity to treat the root cause of the conflict. Israel has allowed into Gaza only a tiny fraction of the water, food and fuel needed by its 2.3m people, prompting warnings from humanitarian organisations and the UN of starvation, thirst and infectious disease. An estimated 14,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, most of them women and children. There are tens of thousands of injuries. But there is nowhere to treat them. Israel has devastated Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, leaving just ten of its 36 hospitals functioning. Three out of every four Palestinians in Gaza have been forcibly displaced from their homes in the north of the territory and are crowding into UN facilities, schools and private houses in the south, where they have continued to be targeted by Israel’s bombardment and from where they are being pushed ever farther south. Whole neighbourhoods have been destroyed along with schools, universities, mosques, churches and UN facilities. The collective punishment of Palestinians is incomparable to any conflict in recent memory. More children were killed in three weeks in Gaza than the number of children killed in global conflict zones every year since 2019. More UN workers have been killed than in any similar period in the organisation’s 78-year history. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an NGO, the war in Gaza has been the deadliest for journalists covering conflict—in terms of the number of deaths over a given period—since it began tracking data in 1992. The violence is not confined to Gaza. In the West Bank more than 200 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th and extremist settlers, armed and empowered by Israel’s Jewish-supremacist public-security minister, are running amok, depopulating villages and terrorising local populations. Add to this the genocidal language from the highest leadership in Israel, where officials are openly discussing plans for the ethnic cleansing of the entire population of Gaza. Members of the Knesset have called for the use of nuclear weapons against Gaza, the defence minister dehumanised Palestinians as “human animals”,  the president said there are no innocent civilians in Gaza and the prime minister invoked a biblical reference, calling for a “holy war of annihilation”. These are not only war crimes, but a blueprint for ethnic cleansing that is designed to make Gaza unliveable. Is a ceasefire really the enemy of peace? Over more than seven decades Israel has not been held to account for its many transgressions of international law: not for its illegal settlement-building, its indiscriminate violence, the 16-year blockade of Gaza, the targeting of journalists; not for its use of deeply repressive measures such as detention without charge or trial, or collective punishments such as home demolitions; not for its system of racial domination, or apartheid, as documented by international, Israeli and Palestinian human-rights organisations; and not for its illegal annexation of East Jerusalem—nor, indeed, its refusal to allow Palestinian refugees their right of return after 75 years. Attempts by the State of Palestine to refer these crimes to the relevant international bodies, such as the International Criminal Court or the International Court of Justice, have been opposed by countries like America and Britain, further consolidating the sense that Israel is above international law and norms. The Palestine Liberation Organisation long ago took the strategic decision to pursue diplomacy to reach our aims of Palestinian statehood, freedom from occupation and the right of return of Palestinian refugees. But this strategy has so far proven a dead end. Even though the world outside Israel supports a two-state outcome, pressure on Israel to get there has been almost entirely absent over the 30 years since the Oslo accords. The Economist rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire but did point out that “Palestinians deserve a state, too.” It is not about “deserving”. This is our inalienable and an internationally sanctioned right, equal to all other peoples in the world, to live free and with self-determination on our own land. The idea that Hamas can be eradicated by military force is also misguided. Hamas is not just its military wing; it is an ideology. You can only challenge an idea by offering a different idea. The path to peace is clear. Recognise the State of Palestine on 1967 borders and end the occupation. That would leave two sovereign states to implement the new reality. The State of Palestine, with the help of the international community, would oversee the massive humanitarian and reconstruction efforts now necessary, provide protection and services to its citizens and convene national elections. This path is not easy. It does not require a lengthy process with interim agreements, but it does require a paradigm shift: an inversion of the Oslo process, establishing the end goal at the outset. It necessitates courage, statesmanship and the implementation of international law and resolutions. Soon we will be faced with a choice: we either wait for the next tragedy or we seize this moment to reach a lasting peace. ■ Husam Zomlot is the Palestinian ambassador to Britain."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/23/for-the-first-time-in-years-israels-leader-wants-a-palestinian-state,"Promises of peace are common. Yet Yair Lapid, Israel’s prime minister, caused a stir when he told the UN General Assembly on September 22nd that he wanted to make peace with Palestinians based on the “two-state solution”.  That plan itself is not new. It has been the basis for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians since the Oslo accords of 1993 and is supported by many governments around the world. It aims to divide the territory currently controlled by Israel into an Israeli state and a Palestinian one.  The previous time an Israeli leader mentioned the two-state solution at the UN was in 2015 when Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, grudgingly said he still supported it. Few, however, believed Mr Netanyahu was doing anything but currying favour with America’s president, Barack Obama, whose administration spent two terms trying to keep the peace process alive. Mr Lapid’s predecessor and coalition partner, Naftali Bennett, conspicuously failed even to mention the Palestinians in his UN speech last year. Mr Lapid has long supported the two-state solution, but he has only been prime minister since June 30th. His speech signals that the pro-peace camp in Israeli politics is not dead. It also reminds Israelis that they cannot forever ignore their country’s military occupation in the West Bank and the blockade it and Egypt impose on Gaza. So long as Palestinians are oppressed, Israel will be unsafe.  That said, Mr Lapid will have immense difficulty turning his words into actions. He is facing an election in less than six weeks and he is far behind Mr Netanyahu’s bloc in the polls. Even the outgoing coalition Mr Lapid currently leads (and would need to rebuild after the election if he were to stay in power) includes influential members who adamantly oppose the creation of a Palestinian state. Gideon Saar, the justice minister and a key ally, said Mr Lapid’s vision would “endanger Israeli’s safety” and that “most Israeli people and their representatives will not allow that to happen.” On this second point, he may be right. In his speech Mr Lapid claimed that a large majority of Israelis supported his aims. But recent polling suggests they do not. In a survey carried out by Tel Aviv University in July, only 40% of Israelis supported a two-state solution, while 50% were against it. What Mr Lapid could truthfully have said is that there is even less support for the three alternatives: a single bi-national state in which all inhabitants have equal rights; Israeli annexation of the West Bank and the official subjugation of the Palestinians; or keeping the situation as it is. Palestinians, for their part, are no more keen on the two-state solution than Israelis.  Even if there was the political and public support to revive the Oslo peace process, many observers believe that it is no longer practical to create two states. Even if one excludes Jewish suburbs in east Jerusalem, which would probably be included in the Israeli state, almost half a million Israeli settlers now live in the occupied West Bank. Since it would not be possible to move that many people, many observers think that any future solution would have to be based on what is in many ways already a one-state reality.  Since becoming prime minister, Mr Lapid has not made any attempt to negotiate with the Palestinian leadership. One problem is that he has no one to talk to. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, was elected in 2005 and has since refused to hold presidential elections. Any deal reached with him would lack legitimacy. Mr Lapid’s speech does not seem to have been aimed at foreign powers or at the Palestinians. Rather, his intended audience is probably Israelis thinking about the general election scheduled for November 1st. Since his main rival will be Mr Netanyahu, who leads a bloc of right-wing and religious parties firmly opposed to letting the Palestinians have a state, Mr Lapid is anxious to establish his own party, Yesh Atid, as the best choice for dovish voters. In doing so, he is making the coming election something of a referendum on trying to make peace.■"
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2016/05/12/israels-villa-in-the-jungle,"SURPRISINGLY, PERHAPS, ISRAEL claims to be taking no sides in the Syrian conflict that rages in full sight of its outposts on the Golan Heights. If shot at it will shoot back; anyone smuggling advanced weapons to Hizbullah in Lebanon will be a fair target; and if Hizbullah comes too close to the Golan border, it will also be hit. For the most part, though, Israel’s view is best summed up by a quip in 1980 by Israel’s then prime minister, Menachem Begin, on the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war: “We wish both sides the greatest success.” Israeli security folk see much good news in the Arab world’s convulsions. Israel’s deterrence is holding. No state directly threatens it. There is no Syrian army to speak of; Iran’s nuclear programme has probably been neutralised for a decade or more by its accord with America; and Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi is the most pro-Israeli Egyptian leader ever. Friendly Arab monarchies have survived and are moving towards a tacit alliance with Israel against Iran. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The nationalist Fatah movement that rules the West Bank is at daggers drawn with Hamas, which holds Gaza. Both are co-operating (up to a point in the case of Hamas) to prevent attacks on Israel. At a time when the frontiers of the Middle East are being questioned as never before, the “1967 border”, which defines the Israeli-occupied territories, might become less inviolable (Israel says the world should now recognise its annexation of the Golan). Verily, says one securocrat, this is a land of miracles. Yet there are still worries aplenty. Radical factions in the ungoverned spaces around Israel might turn their guns on it. Jordan, which implicitly protects Israel’s flank to the east, may yet be consumed by turmoil all around. And by saving the Syrian regime, Russia is strengthening Israel’s arch-foe, Iran. Arabs, too, recognise that events are favouring Israel. Some otherwise sensible Arabs even suspect that the turbulence, including the emergence of Islamic State, are all somehow part of a Zionist conspiracy. That said, these days conversations about the state of the Arab world can go on for hours before the word “Palestine” is uttered. Compared with his ever more right-wing coalition, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, comes across as a moderate. He pays some lip service to the “two-state solution”, the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (and part of Jerusalem) alongside Israel, but the “peace process” is at a dead end. Many in his government say this is no time for territorial concessions. Palestinians retort that the failure to reach a just settlement is sure to feed radicalism. Never mind that the Arab world’s attention may be turned away from Palestine, says Husam Zomlot, a senior Palestinian official: “Israel has 99% of the day-to-day cards, but the Palestinians have the strategic cards.” The occupied land Palestinians claim is disappearing under Israeli roads and settlements in the West Bank. But the Palestinians are winning what some call the “battle of the womb”. The number of Arabs between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river (in Israel and the occupied territories) roughly equals that of Jews, at about 6.3m each, and may soon overtake it. If Israel holds on to the occupied territories permanently, it cannot be both a full democracy and a Jewish state; the comparisons with apartheid are bound to intensify. An idea gaining strength among the pro-settler nationalist-religious right is to allow Gaza to become near-independent, even with its own sea port. That would hive off nearly 2m Palestinians. Some think Hamas might just be tempted to take this opportunity to claim an achievement after three damaging wars with Israel since 2008. All this might explain why Israeli right-wingers are, unusually, complaining that Mr Sisi has been too tough on the Palestinians by cutting traffic and tunnels between Gaza and the restive Sinai peninsula. Just as some Israelis want to turn Gaza into Palestine, Egypt is dumping it back in Israel’s lap."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2015/02/12/the-king-of-cauliflowers,"IT MAY challenge the spirit to think of cauliflower as anything but an overrated, ungainly plant. But in the craggy land between Ramallah and Jerusalem, there is one variety of that plain vegetable that invariably attracts a crazed following at this time of year. Every winter stands manned by farmers pop up along most of the West Bank’s winding roads, with proud growers displaying vivid yellow bouquets wreathed in green roughage. Forget the white vegetable that, when boiled, resembles a brain and releases a gassy aroma redolent of cheap cafeterias. This is zahara baladi, an ancient local cultivar that takes a full year to grow and is in season for just a few weeks. The plant has a nice, mustardy hue; the flavour is well-rounded, sweet and earthy and the texture irresistibly creamy. All this is enough to entice Palestinian Jerusalemites to leave their homes in blustery weather. “It’s cauliflower madness,” one customer agreed cheerfully as he battled a vicious wind to get to a stall. Their craze reflects not just the brief flowering of a delicacy, but also a gastronomic renaissance brought about by successful Ramallah chefs, many of them trained abroad, and a bumper crop of recent books highlighting local cooking. Cauliflower has been mentioned by Arab botanists for more than a millennium. It is the crucial ingredient in maqluba, a gem of Palestinian cuisine in which fried florets are cooked with chicken or lamb (and sometimes eggplant) in a huge pot of spiced rice that is triumphantly turned upside down before serving. Translated literally, zahara baladi means wild flower, and it usually makes its appearance some time in February, just as the terraced hills erupt in a riot of colourful blooms. “This is the golden time of flowering plants,” exults Munir Nasser, a professor of biochemistry at Birzeit University with a passion for local flora. Commercial vegetable growers sometimes try to engineer their plants so as to produce saleable crops twice a year. But purists will always insist on the existing variety of zahara baladi. Local lore ascribes amazing properties to the plant. It is said to cure everything from respiratory ailments to postnatal pain. In villages, chunks of the stuff are artfully combined with onion and spices and blended into a light dough that is fried, producing an appetising fritter. In Jerusalem, families wait eagerly till winter to make mtafayeh—a one-pot wonder consisting of lamb and zahara baladi cooked with goat yogurt, tahini, lemon and fresh minced garlic. “The taste is just different, so good, so soft,” sighs a Jerusalem lawyer and new mother who has just dispatched her husband on a mission to the cauliflower kiosks. Her name, appropriately, is Zahara."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2008/05/08/the-wandering-palestinian,"NAHR AL-BARED in Lebanon was a wind-blown huddle of tents when the first refugees straggled here from Galilee in 1948, the year of the Palestinian nakba or catastrophe. Yet the camp somehow prospered, in spite of the Lebanese laws restricting Palestinians, and despite the influx of yet more refugees during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. By last year it had grown into a crowded but congenial town of 35,000, complete with apartment blocks, schools and clinics. The seaside camp was home to the busiest market in northern Lebanon, but also to a growing band of dour, bearded and fearsomely well-armed Islamist radicals. They hailed mostly not from Palestine but from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria and other countries that were making life difficult for jihad-obsessed Sunni militants. Nahr al-Bared's regular residents tended to shun them. But there was little they could do to keep the 500 or so newcomers out. The feeble Lebanese state takes no responsibility for its 12 Palestinian camps, and the refugees' own institutions have weakened with the decline of the once-dominant Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Last May police in the nearby city of Tripoli clashed with members of the group. Their comrades took revenge by attacking Lebanese army posts, then retreated into Nahr al-Bared. Worried by the addition of al-Qaeda-style radicals to Lebanon's boiling sectarian stew, the army responded with fury. Its siege of Nahr al-Bared lasted 106 days, during which the camp's entire population was forced to flee and watch their homes being pounded into dust by artillery fire. By the time the Lebanese army declared victory in September, some 47 civilians, 167 Lebanese soldiers and a claimed 287 armed guerrillas were dead. The camp is slowly reviving. Ten thousand residents have returned to the less damaged outlying areas. The owner of a makeshift café on the rutted main street has painted a jaunty sign in rainbow colours. “We Shall Rebuild Al Bared and We Shall Return To Palestine”, it promises.  Yet the utterly flattened centre of the camp, which housed 20,000 refugees, remains off-limits. Yasser al-Hajj, a 27-year-old engineer whose family came here from Safad in northern Palestine (now part of Israel), takes a break from shovelling rubble out of a friend's wall-less living room to point towards one of a dozen tilted stacks of collapsed concrete that loom just beyond a Lebanese army checkpoint. The four-storey building contained all his extended family's belongings, as well as their wholesale grocery business, the fruit of 60 years' struggle in exile. Mr al-Hajj assumes they have lost everything. “This is my generation's nakba,” he says dryly. Such bitterness is widely shared among the world's 10m Palestinians, 70% of whom are refugees or their descendants. Other peoples have suffered great tragedies, but the Palestinians' trauma not only refuses to reach closure, it has a horrible habit of repeating itself. Worse yet, its effects continue to poison politics within the wider region and beyond. In annual polling over the past six years, three-quarters of Arabs consistently place the issue of Palestine among their priorities.  In other words, little has changed since 1948, when street sentiment prompted five reluctant Arab governments to send troops on a vain mission to block the creation of Israel. During the ensuing war, the Palestinians' initial nakba, more than half the native population of Palestine, some 750,000 people, fled or were driven from the territory that became the Jewish state, whose troops then barred their return and systematically razed 531 of their ancestral villages. The six-day war in June 1967 brought the remaining 22% of historic Palestine under Israeli rule, and pushed out 250,000 more refugees. In exile, Palestinians have been harassed, attacked or chased away. PLO fighters were forced to flee Jordan after an uprising in 1970. Lebanese Christians destroyed the camps of Tel Zaatar and Qarantina in the 1970s, and massacred Palestinians at Sabra and Chatila in 1982. Israelis besieged the PLO in Beirut the same year, sending PLO leaders to secondary exile in Tunis, and the Syrians did the same in Tripoli in 1984. In 1991 300,000 Palestinians, many of them wealthy and long-settled, were hounded from Kuwait after their leaders foolishly praised Saddam Hussein's invasion of the Gulf emirate. Libya's erratic ruler, Muammar Qaddafi, deported thousands more in the 1990s, saying that since they had signed the Oslo peace accords with Israel, Palestinians should “go home”. Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, nearly all its 20,000 Palestinians have been forced to the borders, where some still languish in dusty desert camps. It is a testimony to the tenacity of Palestinians that they have kept alive a sense of nationhood in the face of so much adversity. Yet the obstacles to sustaining their cohesiveness as a people are today greater than ever.  Around 5m Palestinians live in historic Palestine, under Israeli control. In the West Bank, Israeli settlements and military zones take up 40% of the land. In response to the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, that began in 2000, Israel laced the territory with walls, fences and checkpoints that box its 2.5m Palestinian residents into dozens of largely separate enclaves. Since the Islamist party, Hamas, took control of Gaza last June, its 1.5m people have been confined within the strip's 146 square miles (378 sq km), kept alive on a drip-feed sustenance of international aid. The 1.1m Palestinians inside Israel are far better off, though they have long suffered legal and economic discrimination. They are increasingly isolated from their brethren. Israel bars them, as its citizens, from travelling to Gaza or to most Arab countries, and their cousins in the occupied territories are unable to visit them since Israel, to keep suicide bombers out, has cancelled most permits.  Right-wing Jewish Israeli politicians stir up rhetoric about Palestinian Israelis as “fifth columnists”. Small wonder that in a recent poll 62% of them expressed the fear that Israel would one day expel them. The 250,000 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in 1967, have Israeli residence permits. But if they move to the West Bank or travel abroad to work, they risk losing for ever their right to live in the city of their birth. Outside historic Palestine the picture is mixed. Most Palestinians in Jordan enjoy Jordanian citizenship and hence relative freedom, though their voting power is diluted by blatant gerrymandering in favour of “East Bankers”, the original Jordanians. Lebanon, Syria and Egypt grant Palestinians not passports but a laissez-passer that immigration officers tend to regard with suspicion. That aside, Syria, with its pan-Arab Baathist ideology, gives its 450,000 Palestinians almost all the rights of citizens except the right to vote, which is not much use in a dictatorship anyhow.  By contrast, Lebanon, out of fears that naturalising the country's 350,000 Palestinians, most of them Sunni Muslims, would tip the delicate sectarian power balance, denies them the right to own property or to work in dozens of white-collar professions. Even if they are third-generation refugees in Lebanon, they risk losing their right to re-entry if they stay abroad longer than six months. Egypt, home to just 70,000 Palestinians, is slightly kinder. Palestinians may travel for up to a year, if they get special permits. But Egyptian authorities are notoriously pernickety. Lana Baydas, a British-educated professor at the American University in Cairo, has waited 18 months for residency papers, during which time she has had to fly 18 times to Syria, the only country she can travel freely to on her Syrian-Palestinian laissez-passer, so as not to outstay her month-long Egyptian “tourist” visas. When she tried to explain the bother to a friend, she says ruefully, the reply was, “Can't you just stop being Palestinian?” Ironically, it is Palestinians in the farther shattat or diaspora, beyond the Arab world, who feel the most secure. Antonio Saca, the president of El Salvador, is one of the 100,000 Salvadoreans of Palestinian origin, most of them Bethlehemites who left to escape the collapsing Ottoman empire almost a century ago. There are at least 300,000 Palestinian-Chileans, composed of various waves of emigration. America has maybe a quarter of a million Palestinians, mostly middle-class professionals, and there is a similar-sized but more recent émigré population in Europe, where it has been easier for new exiles to find refuge. Distance and borders are not the only things that divide Palestinians. There are also stark, and growing, gaps between rich and poor, between secularists, Muslims and Christians, between myriad political factions—and between refugees, non-refugees and ex-refugees. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is responsible for the welfare of the 4.5m registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East. Around half of the Palestinians in the occupied territories, including most of the people in Gaza, are refugees; about a quarter of Palestinian Israelis also lost their original homes. Living conditions vary enormously. In the West Bank, only about a third of the refugees live in camps, and even there UNRWA tents have long since been replaced by tightly packed slum housing. Refugees are fiercely proud of their status, with even the rich and successful clinging to their identity. They may buy large villas, but often next to the camps. The 20,000 inhabitants of Balata camp, at the edge of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, still speak with the accent of villages in what is now Israel, even if they are second- or third-generation camp-dwellers. When UNRWA offered to buy land to house refugees outside Jenin's refugee camp after parts of it were flattened by Israeli bulldozers, the residents refused. Similarly, Nahr al-Bared's homeless residents are lobbying to ensure that when their camp is rebuilt, it will still be sectioned into districts named for the Galilee villages the original refugees came from. In Jordan's capital, Amman, the rich and often secular Palestinians who live on the hilltops shun the religiously conservative poor whose houses pack the slopes and valleys. West Bank city-dwellers still shudder at the memory of an influx of job-seeking Gazans during the 1990s, before Israel severed links between the territories. The traditionally more affluent Palestinian Christians have been the likeliest to emigrate, becoming an ever smaller minority, and sometimes a persecuted one as militant Islamism has grown in strength.  An Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, famously jibed in 1968 that “there is no such thing as the Palestinian people.” Respectable historians now accept that Palestinian nationhood began to form in the 19th century. But at the time of the nakba their sense of nationhood was still more tenuous than that of the Jews two millennia ago, who went into exile with a dense religious tradition and centuries of biblical self-rule already under their belts. The world's diverse Palestinian communities are tied together less by history than by the narrative of dispossession and the dream of returning home.  For all his failings, Yasser Arafat, who headed the PLO and its dominant faction, the secular Fatah party, from 1969 until his death in 2004, can be credited with maintaining and strengthening the Palestinians' fragile identity. And he did so while engineering the shift in their aspirations that made peace with Israel a conceptual possibility—a shift from hankering after all-too-tangible lost land to the much more abstract promise of a nation-state, on a much smaller bit of that land.  But in 1993 Mr Arafat made what most Palestinians now regard as the error of agreeing to the Oslo peace accords, which gave no firm promise of a Palestinian state in return for the recognition of Israel, and which eventually collapsed after the failure of talks at Camp David in the summer of 2000. Many conflict-weary Palestinians would have been satisfied with simply having a passport and a secure place to call home. But to the poorer refugees, Oslo smelt of a sell-out. As Jewish settlement in the West Bank accelerated, the newly installed Palestinian Authority grew more corrupt and negotiations collapsed into bloodshed, ever more Palestinians rejected Arafat's brand of nationalism and turned to Hamas. The credo of Hamas, born in 1987 as an offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, is the recuperation of all of historic Palestine for Islam, though over the years it has come to accept the idea of a “long-term” (several decades, say its leaders) truce with Israel. Hamas built its credibility through social programmes, a reputation for honesty and its rejection of a peace process that it saw biased in Israel's favour. AP  But when will this lovely land really be his state? Many of the Palestinians who voted Hamas into power in the 2006 parliamentary elections did so not because they agreed with its ideology but just because Fatah was so awful. Fatah's subsequent, American-backed effort to destabilise the new government only added to Hamas's lustre, and prompted the Islamists to undertake what they regard, with some justification, as a pre-emptive coup in Gaza last summer. Israel's attempts to suppress Hamas have backfired. The result of its blockade on Gaza is that an opinion poll in February showed the Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, beating the Fatah chairman, Mahmoud Abbas, for the presidency for the first time ever. Palestinian deaths since the start of the second intifada stand at over 4,700 and rising, while hundreds of thousands have been impoverished, further hardening attitudes towards Israel. The latest peace talks, launched at Annapolis last November, have changed little on the ground. A growing number of Palestinians seem persuaded that Israel has so entrenched itself in the West Bank that a two-state solution is already out of reach. Around a quarter now say they favour a binational state with equal rights for all—which most Jewish Israelis would never accept. This too is to Hamas's advantage. Its political opponents base their position on secularism and the two-state idea—and both values are eroding. Rumblings of dissent have emerged from within Fatah too, placing pressure on Mr Abbas to toughen his negotiating stance. “If Abu Mazen [Mr Abbas] agrees to anything without the right of return for all refugees, then there will be an intifada of the refugees,” says Shami Shami, a Fatah member of parliament from the Jenin refugee camp. Talk of the “right of return” sets alarms ringing in Israel: if all the refugees returned, Israel would be swamped and Jews would no longer be a majority. In practice, Mr Shami, like most politicians in Fatah, subscribes to a known formula: the conflict must be resolved along the lines of UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of 1948, which states that “the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date,” and decrees that compensation should be paid to the rest.  The biggest poll on how many refugees would actually choose to return was done in 2003 by Khalil Shikaki, a leading Palestinian pollster. He asked refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon if, given the choice, they would go to Israel, go to (or stay in) a Palestinian state, or take citizenship elsewhere. Those who did not go to Israel would get compensation. Overall, 10% said they would want to move to Israel (it was 23% in Lebanon and 5% in Jordan, reflecting the differing conditions of refugees there). Some challenge Mr Shikaki's findings, partly because he added the stipulation that return would be limited to a quota agreed to by Israel, which would undoubtedly be minuscule: informal figures of 10,000 a year have been bandied about, half the current rate of Jewish immigration. More might opt for return if they felt there was a reasonable chance of getting it. Even so, the poll suggests that for most Palestinians recognition of their legal “right” is more important than physical “return”. Full return is unrealistic, agrees Abbas Shiblak, who founded SHAML, a refugee research centre in Ramallah. “But we can't renounce the right of return because it means we accept the Israeli narrative and version of history, which no one will accept.” Not that compensation for the rest would be a minor obstacle. The Aix Group, an Israeli-Palestinian-French economic study team, estimates that a fair package of resettlement or rehabilitation for the 4.5m registered refugees would run to between $55 billion and $85 billion. Given the tangled mess of responsibilities, foreign countries would be expected to stump up. At present, though, even a decent settlement over the land, let alone the refugees, looks a very long way away. Mr Abbas, presiding over only part of the putative Palestinian state—and that precariously—is in no position to take the steps that Israel demands of him to implement a peace deal. Ehud Olmert, Israel's prime minister, cannot concede an inch without incurring the wrath of rightists. The two sides are currently negotiating what the Israelis have already downgraded to a “framework agreement” rather than a full peace deal discussed at Annapolis. The prognosis is poor. But if, against all expectation, they should agree on, say, the exact amount of land that Israel is prepared to relinquish in the West Bank and Gaza, even without specifying the shape of the border, it could make this sad 60th anniversary of the nakba almost celebratory. "
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2013/03/16/could-two-become-one,"IN 1942, as the Holocaust in Europe was entering its most horrific phase, a pacifist American rabbi called Judah Magnes helped found a political party in Palestine called Ihud. Hebrew for unity, Ihud argued for a single binational state in the Holy Land to be shared by Jews and Arabs. Its efforts—and those of like-minded idealists—came to naught. Bitterly opposed to the partition of Palestine, Magnes died in 1948 just as the state of Israel—the naqba, or catastrophe, to Palestinians—was being born. Decades of strife were to follow. At the United Nations, in the White House and around the world, there is a strong belief that any solution ending that strife must be based on two separate states, with a mainly Jewish one called Israel sitting alongside a mainly Arab one called Palestine. The border between them would be based on the one that existed before the 1967 war—known as the “green line”—with some adjustments and land swaps to reflect the world as it is. Jerusalem would be a shared but divided capital. In the face of the manifold obstacles facing such a solution, however, something like Magnes’s one-state variant has been coming back into vogue, both in left-wing Western (and Jewish) circles and among a growing minority of Palestinians. In 2004 a British-born Israeli writer, Daniel Gavron, published a book, “The Other Side of Despair: Jews and Arabs in the Promised Land”, that called for the creation of a democratic binational “State of Jerusalem”. Some Israeli intellectuals are airing the notion of “Post-Zionism”. Avraham Burg, a former Speaker of the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, says a “post-national” model must be explored. “I have no doubt something is emerging, though I am not sure what it is.” Avi Shlaim, a leading British chronicler of the Israel-Palestine saga who was born in Baghdad and brought up in Israel, says he has “shifted…to supporting a one-state solution with equal rights for all citizens,” though he concedes that “this is not what I would ideally like.” Past and present Israeli governments, he thinks, have killed the two-state option, partly by entrenching Jewish settlements so deeply on the West Bank, the heartland of a would-be Palestinian state, that they cannot be removed. This is an assessment the idealists share with hawkish Israelis and a growing number of Palestinians. More and more often, the two-state solution is pronounced dead. Mathematics suggests that the alternative is a one-state solution. But though there are a lot of different one-state outcomes under discussion, none of them really looks like a solution. If one state is simply the rejection of two states, then many Israelis on the right are up for it. In 2009, under American pressure, Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he grudgingly endorsed the two-state idea. Since then he has shown barely a flicker of enthusiasm for it. In a speech to the American Congress in May 2011, he declared triumphantly, and to sustained applause, that Jerusalem would be undivided, evidently under Israeli control, noting that “the vast majority of the 650,000 Israelis who live beyond the 1967 lines reside in neighbourhoods and suburbs of Jerusalem and Greater Tel Aviv.” Yet it is barely conceivable that the Palestinians would ever accept a state that excluded all of Jerusalem. Mr Netanyahu has made clear that he will not countenance the bulk of the West Bank’s settlers being pushed out in order to let the Palestinians have their state. And he is emphatic that Israel must control the Jordan valley as well as the airspace above the Palestinians; their West Bank state would exist under an Israeli lid. “He never made a clear-cut commitment to the two-state solution,” says Mr Netanyahu’s predecessor as prime minister, Ehud Olmert. Regardless of Mr Netanyahu’s position, his Likud party has refused to endorse the creation of any kind of Palestinian state. Most of its Knesset members have joined a “Greater Israel Caucus” that says the West Bank must stay part of Israel for ever. Avigdor Lieberman, a rough-hewn populist whose largely ethnic-Russian party merged with Likud before the election, backs partition but also wants to encourage the fifth of Israeli citizens who are Arabs living within Israel’s 1967 boundary to leave—ethnic cleansing, in Palestinian eyes. Arab Israelis who fail a “test of loyalty” to the state of Israel should, he says, be deprived of various rights, such as the vote. Mr Lieberman is currently out of office, pending an investigation into alleged fraud, but the 31 seats held together by his party and Likud is easily the biggest bloc in the 120-seat Knesset. Naftali Bennett, a 40-year-old software tycoon with a hip Californian manner, is the most strident new voice on the Israeli right: blunter than Mr Netanyahu, more openly dismissive of the two-state idea, and more hawkish than another, bigger beneficiary of Israeli voters in January’s general election, Yair Lapid. (Mr Lapid’s party won 19 seats in the Knesset to Mr Bennett’s 12.) Asked about removing Jewish settlements from the West Bank and creating a Palestinian state between Jerusalem and the Jordan river, Mr Bennett breezily replies that “It just ain’t gonna happen.” Of the Palestinians, he says “I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state. It would be national suicide for Israel.” Instead, Mr Bennett wants Israel to annex the 61% of the West Bank known as “Area C” (see map), in essence the territory’s central and eastern slab, going down to the Jordan valley. The Palestinians—at least 50,000—who live there would become Israeli citizens, should they stay. The other 2.6m or so Palestinians on the West Bank would have to be content with “full-blown autonomy” in their towns and villages. This, in essence, would mean municipal rights (he mentions garbage collection). Jewish settlers would stay put. Mr Lapid, a jovial former television anchorman now deemed a kingmaker in the Knesset, is considered a centrist by Israelis. But he is no enthusiast for a two-state plan, at least not of the sort promoted by Western diplomats or in the UN. He chose to make his chief election speech at the university of Ariel, one of the largest and most controversial of Jewish settlements, a town of 20,000 people (with another 12,000 students) built deep within the West Bank. The second person on his party’s list in the Knesset is a settler rabbi. Mr Lapid also argues for Jerusalem to remain undivided under Israeli control. The only mainly Jewish parties that treat negotiations towards a two-state solution as a priority are Tzipi Livni’s group (which won a paltry six seats in the recent election), Meretz (which also got six) and the rump of Ariel Sharon’s Kadima party (just two). Three Arab-Israeli parties, all two-staters, got 11 seats between them. The Labour Party, long Israel’s leading proponent of a two-state solution, got 15 seats. But its campaign concentrated almost exclusively on domestic issues. Indeed, the degree to which the election and its coalition-cobbling aftermath ignored negotiations with the Palestinians to any end at all was telling. Mr Bennett’s provocative no-state-for-the-Palestinians oratory was noticed. But he was never rebuked for it by, say, Mr Netanyahu. In sum, despite Mr Netanyahu’s glum espousal of the two-state idea in his speech at Bar-Ilan, proponents of a state of Israel that encompasses all or most of the West Bank are plainly the strongest force in the Knesset. On March 14th, Mr Netanyahu announced a proposed government in advance of a visit by Barack Obama on March 20th. It contains Mr Lapid and Mr Bennett; Ms Livni will probably be its only member keenly committed to negotiations with the Palestinians. Within Israel, the Palestinian question simply does not seem urgent. Even the settlers do not seem to feel threatened. With a web of well-built roads knitting their infrastructure into that of Israel proper—some of them reserved for Israeli use—a visitor barely notices which side of the green line he is on. Those living in the settlements have scant contact with Palestinians whose villages lie close by. In 2012, for the first year since 1973, not a single Jewish Israeli was killed as a result of Palestinian violence on the West Bank. Palestinians, for their part, talk more and more of “a one-state reality”—while most caution that it is not a “solution”. They argue that the notion of a viable, contiguous, sovereign Palestinian state sitting peacefully alongside Israel is no longer feasible. An ever more popular parallel for the situation is South Africa before and after its emergence from apartheid. The main similarity is the existence of two separate systems of government and law for two people living side by side on territory that is occupied as a result of conquest and confiscation. The web of Israeli roads and the restrictions that Palestinians face in terms of travel are compared to the sequestering of black South Africans in wretched “bantustans”. Israel’s security fence, in many places a five-metre (15-foot) concrete wall wound round Jewish settlements is inevitably known to Palestinians as “the apartheid wall”. Scores of checkpoints recall the old South African “pass laws” whereby blacks needed permission to go from one area to another, especially in search of work in “white” areas. The campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel, which is growing in strength in America and Britain, sees the one-state reality as a precursor to a civil-rights movement that would then bring down the “apartheid state” with the help, as in South Africa, of external support inflamed by the injustice. If Jewish settlers were determined to remain on the West Bank, they might be able to do so—but under Palestinian authority. Israel’s president, Shimon Peres, and its former prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert—men in what used to be the mainstream of national politics—worry about just such a future. They have warned that, unless the occupation of the bulk of the West Bank ends, or Palestinians in the West Bank are given full voting rights in Israel, the country will lose its claim to be a democracy. It will, says Mr Peres, become a “pariah”, just as South Africa did. The BDS campaign may thus, he implies, become unstoppable. Even the Americans might find it hard to go on backing Israel come hell or high water. More hawkish Palestinians, typified by the Islamist movement, Hamas, are not giving up on a two-state solution; they never believed in it in the first place. They still dream of a land where they hold sway from the Mediterranean to the Jordan river, with Jews and Christians living there, if they are lucky, on sufferance. Accepting that this harsh scenario is unlikely to come to pass in the short run, its proponents talk merrily of the long game, waiting for a generation or even two. These true-believing one-staters have a strong position in Hamas, and it is one that will likely get stronger if people like Mr Bennett call the Israeli tune. “We consider the whole of Palestine our land,” says Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader in Gaza, sitting at home beside a portrait of two sons killed fighting the Israelis. History and time, he says with a big smile, are on Hamas’s side. “The Islamic trend is coming to power. Ten years is enough to neutralise the power of Israel and its supporters.” An Islamist regime has come to power next-door in Egypt; Syria may be next; Hamas’s allies in Jordan are shaking King Abdullah’s throne. “No one can guess what will happen tomorrow.” “In the end I am sure there will be just one state,” says Basam al-Naim, for seven years Hamas’s minister of health in Gaza. “But what kind of state I cannot say. Many Jews would leave and many Palestinians would come back. In ten to 20 years there will be a completely different geopolitical map.” The 1m-odd Russian Jews who have bolstered Israel since the Soviet Union collapsed, he says, would have to go. “They are already segregated in Israel,” he adds. “And many of them are not even Jews.” Over the years, some Hamas leaders, such as Khaled Meshal, have groped towards accepting Israel, at least as a “reality” to be grudgingly accepted. Some now posit a two-state solution, albeit often as a step on the way to a single state, once Muslims, Jews and Christians learn to live happily together, perhaps in some federal halfway house. In every one-state outcome, be it created by virtue of persuasion or under duress, Jews would eventually be a minority (see chart). Mr Bennett seeks to avoid this by advocating “autonomy” outside Israel for much of the West Bank. But he must know that the autonomy he advocates will never satisfy the Palestinians, nor the neighbouring Arab countries that host several million Palestinian refugees, most of whose forebears fled when Israel was founded in 1948. “I do not have a clear-cut solution,” he concedes, before reverting to the old argument that “Jordan is Palestine.” Most Jordanians, it is true, are of Palestinian origin. But would Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza, let alone those within the borders of Israel, be satisfied with a state on the east side of the Jordan river, presuming that the present monarchy would grant it to them? Not a chance. Though Mr Bennett might want them to, the Egyptians aren’t going to let Gaza be dumped on them, either. But, like the activists of BDS, Mr Bennett and his friends know that granting Palestinians proper civil rights within an enlarged Israel would mean that the Jews would soon be outnumbered and later outvoted by the Palestinians. Though ultra-Orthodox Jews are the fastest growing community in Israel, Palestinians still outbreed Israelis as a whole. Palestinians in Israel already add up to 1.6m, along with 2.6m on the West Bank and 1.7m in Gaza. Jewish Israelis on both sides of the green line number about 6m. “In ten to 15 years Palestinians would have a majority in one state,” says Mr Olmert. This means that none of the one-state options makes sense for Israel in the long run. The idealists paint a picture of Arabs and Jews getting along swimmingly together: dream on. The hawks think the Palestinians can be kept quiet for ever if they are denied a state: again, dream on. At the same time, the analogy with South Africa is fatally flawed. Israel within its 1967 borders has international legitimacy; no white South African state could ever have claimed as much; beyond a few Afrikaner zealots the idea would have been a non-starter. So a two-state solution was never possible. And a situation in which blacks outnumber whites by ten to one is completely unlike a situation where the sides have comparable numbers. In conceding the principle of one-person-one-vote South Africa’s whites knew that they were losing their political primacy for good. Israeli Jews will not do that. Even if the Palestinians were remarkably tolerant—and that is questionable—Israel as a Jewish state would disappear. Even the name would go. It is barely conceivable that Jews, after running their own vibrant polity for half a century and praying for a return to their ancestral homeland for two millennia, would quietly submit to Palestinian majority rule, however idealistic its proponents. That is why Dov Khenin, a Jewish member of the Knesset’s mainly Arab and communist-inclined Hadash party, sees two states as the only practical path to peace even while sympathising with the ideals of the one-staters. “If the two peoples want to have a binational state, OK,” he says wistfully. “But my impression is that Israelis and Palestinians don’t very much like each other.” Nor, he implies, will they ever do so. Academic gatherings, such as a conference last year at Harvard to discuss the one-state option, have yet to put flesh on the idealists’ notions. Would a federal framework provide for separate assemblies? What sort of army and police would there be? Would, as Mr Gavron’s book suggests, the Jews have to drop their Law of Return (allowing any diaspora Jew to become a citizen) and the Palestinians likewise have to drop their Right of Return (letting all refugees and their descendants back)? Few have begun to address such nettlesome questions, because in truth, few see a one-state outcome as a true goal. Most come to it out of exhausted despair or amiable fantasy. Israel, as Mr Netanyahu must know, cannot remain both democratic and Jewish if it continues to control several million Palestinians without granting them full political rights. At the same time, he dreads the encirclement of hostile Arab states around him, and frets that America, under Barack Obama, may fail to make good on its promise to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile he lamely repeats the old mantra that “there is no Palestinian partner for peace.” Quite possibly he does not know what he should, can or will do. Had Mitt Romney won the American presidency, he might have given Mr Netanyahu a fillip. Mr Obama has no such desire. Instead, he will repeat to the Israeli leader what Mr Netanyahu has almost said but cannot bring himself fully to endorse—that there is no serious alternative to a two-state deal."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/12/07/despite-the-war-in-gaza-talk-of-a-two-state-solution-persists,"BRUTAL and distressing, for sure, but perhaps the war between Israel and Hamas could also be an opportunity. That was how America’s president saw it, at least. Though he backed Israel’s right to defend itself, he argued that the fighting should be a wake-up call for Israelis and Palestinians alike. “The moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people,” he said in a televised interview. The president, in this case, was a newly inaugurated Barack Obama almost 15 years ago. But it could just as well be Joe Biden today. History has a way of repeating itself in the Middle East. War in Gaza has once again led to talk of peace, which may seem far-fetched, given the massacre of more than 1,200 Israelis on October 7th and the subsequent killing of some 16,000 Palestinians during the Israeli assault on Gaza. The Holy Land has not seen this much bloodshed since Israel was founded in 1948. Peace has never seemed so far away. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas. Mr Biden hopes it will emerge nonetheless. “When this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next, and in our view it has to be a two-state solution,” he said in October. At a conference in Bahrain in November, one Arab official after another offered a similar message. “We need to go back to a two-state solution, to an Israeli and Palestinian state living side by side,” said Anwar Gargash, an adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some see such talk as a fig leaf, intended to dispel misgivings about Western support for Israel and Arab inaction amid a horrifying war. After all, the 30-year peace process between Israelis and Palestinians is littered with failures. A revival of negotiations would be doomed from the start without, at the very least, three essential changes. First is new leadership. The political parties on either side of the current war in Gaza are the same ones that laboured to spoil the nascent peace process 30 years ago; they must go. Next is an effort to make the negotiations credible: both sides are ever more doubtful about the other’s sincerity. Last, both sides need incentives to make a deal. Palestinians need to feel that their state is viable, and Israelis need to feel that theirs will be secure. The two-state solution has been around, in one form or another, for almost a century. The United Nations adopted a partition plan for Palestine in 1947 that would have created two states, one Arab and one Jewish, with international control of Jerusalem. Arab states rejected it, Israel declared independence, and its neighbours promptly invaded. After decades of conflict, Israelis and Palestinians began talks at a peace conference in Madrid in 1991. Then came the Oslo accords in 1993, which set a five-year deadline to create a Palestinian state and in the meantime established the Palestinian Authority (PA), a government of sorts, albeit with limited powers and jurisdiction over only part of the occupied territories. A string of failures followed: the summits at Camp David and Taba, the Bush administration’s “road map for peace”, Mr Obama’s diplomacy. The last direct talks collapsed in 2014 and were never resuscitated. All along, the outline of a two-state solution changed little. There would be a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank—around 22% of the area of historic Palestine—with its capital in east Jerusalem. Israel would keep some settlements in the West Bank, in exchange for territorial swaps, and evacuate others. A token number of refugees would be allowed to return to Israel and a greater number to Palestine. The idea was once popular, but many have lost faith. Even before October 7th, only a third or so of Palestinians and Israeli Jews supported a two-state solution, down from almost half just five years ago (see chart). “Every failed process has a price tag,” says Nimrod Novik, who was a foreign-policy adviser to Shimon Peres, an Israeli politician. “It reinforces the erroneous conclusion that it cannot be done.” Since October 7th support for peace negotiations of any kind has plunged in Israel. Despite the disillusionment, there is no clear alternative. Polls show both Israelis and Palestinians divided about how to end the conflict. Some hope for a “one-state solution” that would see them live in a single country with equal rights. Others support apartheid or ethnic cleansing (they disagree, of course, on who the victims of such an approach should be). These are all non-starters. The events of October 7th blew up the status quo. Expulsion or discrimination are abhorrent. A one-state solution might sound reasonable, but it is practically unworkable: most Israelis and Palestinians reject the idea. That leaves two states. The hitch is that this solution requires big sacrifices from both sides. Israelis would have to give up land, while Palestinians would have to give up on much of the land they have lost since 1948. Leaders on both sides would need to sell these concessions to a sceptical public. But neither side has such leaders. Israel has Binyamin Netanyahu, who has spent his entire career trying to prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state. In a sop to Mr Obama, he did endorse a two-state solution in a speech in 2009 at Bar-Ilan University—though six years later he declared that the Middle East had changed and his speech was “irrelevant”. His Likud party has adopted resolutions opposing Palestinian statehood. Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, reported in November that Mr Netanyahu met backbenchers from Likud to plead for his political survival. “I am the only one who can prevent a Palestinian state in Gaza and Judea and Samaria after the war,” he said, using the Hebrew name for the West Bank. But Mr Netanyahu’s days are numbered. Most Israelis want him gone—fully 76% according to a poll published in November. Surveys suggest that, if an election were held, his Likud party would lose around half of the 32 seats it now holds in the 120-member Knesset. The frontrunner to succeed Mr Netanyahu is Benny Gantz, a former army chief who reluctantly joined Mr Netanyahu’s war cabinet in October. His centre-right National Unity party has opened a wide lead in the polls. He is becoming a rarity in Israel’s fractious politics: a unifying figure. Some of this is down to his vague position on the two-state solution. He has said little about it in public. His party’s official position is a woolly call for “separation from the Palestinians”, without any detail on how this might be achieved. Sources close to Mr Gantz say he has no interest in being more specific. To do so, they say, would play into the hands of Mr Netanyahu. Palestinian statehood is a wedge issue, and therefore Mr Gantz will try to avoid it in the interest of wooing voters away from the prime minister. “In Benny’s conversations with the Americans he says that we should stop using old words for new situations,” says an aide. In other words, he is open to discussing a form of the two-state solution but is wary of using the discredited term. In surveys carried out by his party, most Israelis are in favour of a two-state solution when it is described in other terms, such as “two separate entities”. If Mr Gantz were to pursue some variation on the two-state solution, he would face political obstacles. His party includes hawkish lawmakers who would oppose such a push. “Gantz has some very, very right-wing people in there,” says Dan Ben-David of the Shoresh Institute, an Israeli think-tank. The same goes for some of his prospective coalition partners—and the Israeli public, which has swung to the right over the past few decades. Palestinian politics look even more forbidding. A peace process is unthinkable with Hamas, which has spent three decades playing spoiler. It started a campaign of suicide-bombings to sabotage the Oslo accords, and then soured a generation of Israelis on the idea of peace with continued attacks during the Palestinians’ second intifada, or uprising. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, supports a two-state solution, as does his nationalist Fatah party. But he is 88 years old and will soon start the 20th year of what should have been a four-year term. Few Palestinians (or Israelis, for that matter) think he has the legitimacy or acumen to lead a serious push for peace. “He’s in a delusional bubble, surrounded by three or four very powerful yes-men,” says an Israeli officer, an assessment shared by many of Mr Abbas’s former associates. The White House has mused about Salam Fayyad, a technocratic ex-prime minister and former IMF official, coming back to his old job. Even Arab officials now say in private that they want a change in Palestinian leadership. The Saudis are pushing for Hussein al-Sheikh, Mr Abbas’s right-hand man, to succeed the president. The UAE hopes to see a role for Muhammad Dahlan, a former Fatah security chief who has spent the past decade in exile in Abu Dhabi. They would all be acceptable to Israel—but perhaps not to Palestinians. Polls put their popularity in the single digits. Another option is Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah leader serving five life sentences in Israel for orchestrating attacks on Israeli civilians. (He refused to present a defence, denouncing the trial as illegitimate.) Some hope he could become a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, emerging from prison to unite a fractured movement and negotiate with Israel. He often polls as the most popular Palestinian leader—but that is mostly because he has spent decades out of the public eye, at a time when Fatah descended into corruption and senescence. Even if Israel allowed him out, it is unclear how capable a leader he would be. American and Arab officials have pushed for Palestinian elections. At least in the West Bank, though, that could lead to victory for whatever remains of Hamas, seen by Palestinians as the only party willing to stand up to Israel. For Fatah to regain popularity, it would need to do two things. One is to curb its members’ rampant graft (asked to name the most pressing problem for the PA to tackle, more Palestinians mention corruption than occupation). The other is to show that a non-violent approach can yield results. “They have to make Hamas ineffective,” says Khalil Sayegh, a Palestinian academic from Gaza. “People have to see that Hamas is not really doing anything good.” That requires concessions from Israel, which points to a second question: how to make negotiations credible. After decades of failure, both Israelis and Palestinians would be sceptical. For Israelis, though, those decades were nonetheless good ones: they coincided with an economic boom, a long stretch of relative peace and burgeoning relations with Arab states. For Palestinians, they brought only deepening despair. “The whole project of an independent Palestinian state is becoming part of the past,” says Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian minister. The onus would be on Israel to dispel that perception. Mr Novik is part of Commanders for Israel’s Security, a group of retired security officials who advocate a two-state solution. He offers a “menu” of steps Israel could take to show renewed commitment. It could shrink Area C, the two-thirds of the West Bank under full Israeli control, and expand Area B, where the PA has authority over civil matters, but not security. (Area A, where the PA has full control, is even smaller: see map.) It could stop demolishing unlicensed homes in Area C, where it refuses to grant Palestinians construction permits (it usually issues ten or fewer each year). It could curtail army raids in Palestinian cities. For Palestinians, though, these steps would be woefully insufficient. A slightly expanded Area B would hardly be a resounding achievement that Fatah could sell to a dubious public. “We’ve waited 30 years for a state,” says a diplomat. “We don’t want some construction permits.” The Oslo accords, after all, were undone by gradualism: the idea that both sides needed to build trust with symbolic moves before agreeing on more substantive steps. Asked what would constitute a more serious gesture, several Palestinian analysts point to the settlements in the occupied West Bank, home to around 465,000 Israelis. It would not be enough to freeze new construction, they say; that has been tried before, including under Mr Obama. Israel should go further and dismantle some of the settlements it would have to relinquish in a peace deal. That would both build confidence and advance a final-status agreement. It also seems politically impossible in Israel, especially after October 7th, since it would be seen as rewarding a massacre. After decades of foot-dragging, Israel is unlikely to make any big gestures without pressure from America. “Unless the Israeli system actually feels there’s a cost for going in this direction, I don’t see how you free up some space for different politics,” says Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator. An Arab diplomat suggests this pressure, too, should initially be aimed at settlers: “America needs to get rough.” On December 6th America announced that it would impose visa bans on violent settlers who attack Palestinians and their property. That is an unprecedented step—but it, too, is symbolic. Settlers motivated by ideology are unlikely to be dissuaded by a visa ban. Anyway, some of them cannot be banned: they are American citizens. For an American squeeze on settlements to succeed, it would need to encompass the Israeli state, too. International law obliges the Israeli army to protect Palestinians in occupied territory, but it often stands by as settlers carry out attacks. If it continues to allow (and sometimes abet) such violence, America could threaten to cut military aid. That would be a clear signal, to the Palestinians and the Arab world, that America was serious about trying to play a less biased role. But such a threat is hard to imagine in an election year—or if Donald Trump wins the presidency in 2024. If Mr Biden secures a second term, though, such a move would be popular with the progressive wing of his party. Along with threats, America and its partners would also have to offer incentives. For the Palestinians, these would probably be mainly financial. The most immediate question is how to rebuild a shattered Gaza, the bill for which will easily run into tens of billions of dollars. Wealthy Gulf states would be willing to contribute—but only if Gaza becomes part of a Palestinian state and their investments are unlikely to be blown up again. At the same time, the Gulf states could help assuage Israel’s security concerns. When the Oslo process began, only one Arab state, Egypt, had diplomatic ties with Israel. Today six of them do, and Saudi Arabia appears willing to join the club. The prospect of normal relations with the Arab world seems real in a way it never did in decades past. Ending conflict not only with the Palestinians but also with the entire region should be a powerful inducement. At a meeting in Qatar earlier this month, the Gulf states talked about a plan for post-war Gaza. They resolved to work with Jordan, Egypt and Western powers to form an international coalition to push for a two-state solution. Arab states would demand that the PA choose new leaders, while America would press Israel. But even if the Gulf states recognise Israel, Iranian-backed militant groups that have weighed in on Hamas’s side, such as Hizbullah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen, would not do the same. “We would have to get Iran on board,” says a diplomat from the Gulf. Asked if that was realistic, he demurred. Hostility toward Israel has been a core tenet of the Islamic Republic’s ideology for decades. The creation of a rump Palestinian state may not turn them into Zionists overnight. The risk, then, is that history repeats itself again. A new crop of leaders might pay lip service to a two-state solution. Israel might soften its hostility toward the PA and offer a few concessions. Gulf states would pledge money and recognition. But the deal on offer would be, fundamentally, the same as before—a deal that a far more optimistic generation of Israelis and Palestinians rejected. In recent years intellectuals on both sides have begun calling for more creative thinking. One idea is of a confederation in which there would be both a Jewish and a Palestinian entity. Citizens of one part would be entitled to live and work in the other. The idea is to diminish the importance of exactly how such a small parcel of land is carved up and to give each side greater interest in the stability of the other. There are even more obstacles to this idea than to the standard two-state blueprint, but there is a virtue in novel concepts. “Israel benefits from the unseriousness of an international approach which simply says, go back to two-state negotiations,” says Mr Levy. Those negotiations too often become an end rather than a means, even though by now there is little left to negotiate: it has all been discussed ad infinitum. The events of the past few months show the status quo is untenable. Change is inevitable. The only question is what form it will take. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/settlers-are-causing-mayhem-in-the-west-bank,"VIOLENCE PERPETRATED by Jewish settlers in the Palestinians’ West Bank has risen sharply since October 7th. The Israeli army and the settlers have, in total, killed at least 155 Palestinians in the territory, the core of a would-be Palestinian state, since Hamas committed its atrocities against Israel. This death toll is a fraction of the number killed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in the same period. But it is rising dangerously fast. The occupied West Bank is getting closer to boiling over. Last year was already the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank for 20 years. Settler groups have become bolder and the army has intensified its raids on Palestinian towns and cities. But since October 7th things have dramatically worsened. At the current rate, the four weeks following the Hamas attack will have been more deadly for Palestinians in the West Bank than the whole of last year. Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas In particular, the war in Gaza has aroused some of the more violent groups of West Bank settlers. Some are out for revenge for Hamas’s atrocities. Others are simply taking advantage of the situation to lash out while Israel’s army is busy elsewhere—in Gaza and on the northern front with Lebanon. As a result, the West Bank’s Palestinians are feeling even more vulnerable than usual. In Qusra, a village south-east of the city of Nablus, four Palestinians were killed by settlers on October 11th. The next day, during a funeral procession for them, two more were shot dead by settlers, according to Hani Awda Abu Alaa, the town’s mayor. “[The army] assured us over the phone that the new route was secure,” he said. “But they set a trap for us…We encountered a large number of settlers who attacked us with stones and bullets.” The mayor accused Israeli soldiers of “protecting the settlers”. What has changed in the past few weeks is that elements of the army and those settlers who are bent on violence appear to have teamed up, according to Yonatan Kanonich of Yesh Din, an Israeli watchdog that monitors Jewish settlements in the West Bank. “People sometimes wear army trousers or shirts, they have weapons,” he explains. “You don’t understand if it’s a settler or a soldier, you can’t really tell. It’s all the same now,” he says. “If the soldiers stood back idly before, and didn’t do anything, now they are joining the settlers in their attacks.” Some 500,000 Israelis live in settlements (excluding East Jerusalem) in the West Bank regarded as illegal by the UN and foreign governments. They are often cited as an obstacle in peace talks and plainly undermine the territorial integrity of a future Palestinian state. The building of settlements has steadily increased since the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords signed in Oslo in 1993. Since October 7th President Joe Biden has urged Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to rein in the settlers—in vain. Extreme right-wing settlers who hold key posts in Mr Netanyahu’s cabinet seem to have no wish to calm things down. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national-security minister, grinned as he handed out rifles to Israelis to protect “settlements and the cities”. Mr Netanyahu’s current government has delighted the settlers by earmarking large sums for settler roads (from which Palestinians are generally barred) and by giving Bezalel Smotrich, an ultra-nationalist settler who is the finance minister, extra power over planning regulations in the West Bank, though the last word on this still lies with Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister. On the ground, settlers are rarely punished for initiating the violence. In June they rampaged through Turmus Ayya, a Palestinian town, setting fire to homes and cars. One Israeli officer branded the settler attacks “nationalist terrorism”. But no serious consequences followed. Once labelled as rogue operators, violent settlers now have representation in Israel’s coalition government. For years some Palestinian officials and foreign observers have been warning of a third intifada, or uprising—and now fear it is likely to break out. “It has already exploded,” says Tawfiq Tirawi, a former Palestinian security chief with strong ties to the West Bank’s refugee camps who fell out with Mr Abbas. “The people are brimming with anger and a revolutionary spirit,” he says. So far unrest has been mainly limited to protests in Palestinian cities. The Israeli security forces, sometimes aided by the Palestinian authorities, have arrested thousands to keep a lid on things. Israeli checkpoints have been sharply curbing Palestinian movement. Some Palestinian campaigners say the Israeli government, with the help of settlers, wants to depopulate the West Bank of its Palestinians. Near the big city of Hebron, 13 Palestinian villages, they claim, have been thinned out as a result of threats of settler violence. “It’s clear they are planning and organising…you are talking about an organised militia,” says Shawan Jabarin, a veteran human-rights activist in Ramallah, the Palestinians’ administrative headquarters. He says many Palestinians see the violence as part of a plan eventually to push them out of the West Bank altogether. “It’s about revenge,” adds Mr Kanonich. When Hamas burst out of Gaza to murder Israeli communities across the border on October 7th, most of the Israeli soldiers stationed in the West Bank were regulars or conscripts. But in the next few days, as around 360,000 reservists were called up, most of the regular troops were deployed either to take part in a ground offensive into Gaza or to the northern border with Lebanon in case of war breaking out with Hizbullah, the Shia Muslim militia. Many Israeli reservists and a number of senior commanders are deeply hostile to the settlers and would like them to be restrained. But they fear that other groups of reservists left behind on the West Bank may be unable or unwilling to do this. Israel’s army and border police have rarely arrested settlers for violence, though one ringleader has been put into administrative detention without being formally charged. The Palestinian Authority, which is supposed to administer chunks of the West Bank, is largely powerless to protect Palestinian civilians. Its senior officials are strongly against the prospect of another intifada, fearing that that would give Hamas an opportunity to become the dominant Palestinian force in the West Bank. In any case, much of the violence takes place in areas where the Palestinian security forces have no freedom of movement or jurisdiction. Palestinians reckon it is unthinkable that they would arrest or directly confront a settler. One veteran Palestinian security official says he fears that a single incident may spark an intifada. “I smell blood in the West Bank,” he says. “I don’t know where it will be, but it is coming: the settlers are going to do something terrible.” ■ Correction (December 4th, 2023): The original version of this article mistakenly stated that America does not consider Israel’s settlements in the West Bank to be illegal per se. Under Donald Trump, the American government reversed its decades-long position on this question. Joe Biden’s administration has not overturned that decision. The story has been corrected. Sorry."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2010/02/25/does-mossad-really-make-israel-safer," ALTHOUGH they stolidly refuse to admit that their external security service had done it, Israeli officials say they are confident that in Europe and elsewhere outrage over the recent assassination in Dubai of a Hamas commander will quickly blow over. Israeli ambassadors were called in and carpeted in London, Canberra and Dublin over stolen passports and identities used by the team that killed Mahmoud al-Mabhouh and was later exposed by the Dubai police. eu foreign ministers have “strongly condemned” the action. But the Israelis, seeking to minimise the damage, note innocently that the complaints focused on the passports rather than the actual killing—and anyway stopped short of explicitly fingering Mossad. Indeed, despite the meticulous closed-circuit television records of the comings and goings through Dubai's airport and hotels, Mossad people still say, with an almost straight face, that the evidence is circumstantial. A former spymaster, Rafi Eitan, even suggested half in jest that a rival service may have framed the Israelis. In any event, even though they do not admit their involvement, the Israelis are portraying Mr Mabhouh's demise as part of a wider war waged by Israel together with the West and its own secret services. The Israelis stress that Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group, is as much the West's enemy as it is Israel's. So, they add, is Hizbullah, the Lebanese group. Both, they note, are clients of Iran. Israel says Mr Mabhouh was a kidnapper and murderer who, more recently, had procured arms, chiefly from Iran. The Israelis want to block the flow of weapons, especially rockets, into Gaza, which Hamas runs. To this end, they have raided ships off the Horn of Africa and bombed a convoy of lorries in eastern Sudan. “This is the broader background to what happened in Dubai,” says an Israeli familiar with Mossad. “Friendly governments know it full well”—and tacitly, he says, approve. Still, the choice of Dubai, a commercial hub with friendly ties to the West, as a venue for the assassination has discomfited some Israelis in intelligence circles. They want Meir Dagan (pictured above), now into his eighth year as Mossad's head, to make way for a younger man. Insiders say he has kept down potential successors, making it hard for Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, to sack him.  A power struggle in Mossad would come at a bad time for Israel. The Dubai imbroglio comes just as the agency faces its hardest test in more than a decade. During his first term as prime minister (1996-99), Mr Netanyahu told Mossad to prevent Iran, by every means other than military force, from getting a nuclear weapon. Mossad's head is responsible in the Israeli hierarchy for both political and clandestine efforts to stymie Iran's nuclear ambitions and to collect and share intelligence on that score with other governments. Leaked reports over the years suggest the Israelis have had some success in slowing the Iranians down. More recently, however, it has been reported that Mossad may have run out of tricks to that end. Israeli intelligence sources, however, say that is not so. A mix of non-military methods to monitor and disrupt Iran's nuclear plans is still, they say, working. Yet they do not, understandably, rule out the eventual use of direct force against Iran's nuclear facilities. For the time being, Mr Netanyahu is urging “crippling sanctions”.  By the same token, a Mossad source says that cloak-and-dagger operations still have their uses, even though ultra-modern electronic and biometric skills, used with surprising efficiency (in Israeli eyes) by Dubai's police, make such operations, involving wigged disguises and old-style skulduggery, harder to pull off. “But every technical problem is a challenge,” says the source. “Rest assured our leading intelligence agencies are working on solutions.” Thoughtful Israeli critics of Mossad, of its swashbuckling director and of Mr Netanyahu, say the intelligence service has two other defects that should be tackled: arrogance and complacency. A pernicious “superiority complex”, says a former intelligence man, has taken root in both Mossad and Shin Bet, the internal security service also known by its Hebrew acronym, Shabak. The apparent success with which they have monitored and infiltrated Palestinians in the West Bank has created an attitude of condescension that inhibits peacemaking.  Only this week it was revealed, amid Israeli intelligence chuckles, that a Hamas founder's son had been a long-serving Shin Bet agent. Why bother to negotiate with the Palestinians, some intelligence people may feel, when they can be constantly hamstrung by such trickery? Others, however, disagree. Much may depend on Mr Dagan's succession. "
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/03/how-israel-plays-into-hamass-hands," THE “lynch” is what the Israeli government, media and man-in-the-street are calling their navy's interception on May 31st of the six-vessel multi-nation flotilla that was attempting to bring aid to Gaza. And, in Israeli eyes, the victims of the lynch mob were not the pro-Palestinian activists, perhaps nine of them Turkish, who were shot dead in the operation, nor the dozens of others who were injured, but the Israeli commandos who were set upon with clubs and staves when they shimmied down from helicopters onto the deck of the leading vessel, a Turkish pleasure steamer called Mavi Marmara.  One popular columnist extended the “lynch” metaphor to the United Nations Security Council where, on June 1st, member-states unanimously condemned “those acts which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians” and called for a “prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation”. American diplomats had laboured to mitigate much tougher language proposed by Turkey and others. But the Obama administration's failure to cast a blanket veto on any deprecation of Israel is depicted in Israel almost as a betrayal. The head of Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service, warned a Knesset committee that Israel was becoming “less of a strategic asset” to the United States (for an American view see article). The disconnect between the way Israel sees itself and its actions and the way they are viewed by the world outside has never, it seems, been so wide. Nor has it ever been so starkly highlighted as by the bungled operation in the Mediterranean, some 80km (50 miles) off Israel's (and Gaza's) coast. A wave of anti-Israel demonstrations swept through cities around the world and Turkey recalled its ambassador.  Inside Israel, too, the gulf is palpably deepening between leftish liberals and the rightist-religious government coalition that represents majority opinion. Writers, such as Amos Oz and David Grossman, and left-wing politicians voiced their criticism this week of the entire policy of blockade and boycott against Hamas-ruled Gaza. But their opinions were widely excoriated as treachery and defeatism.  Where cracks did appear in the broad front of righteous victimhood was over the actual execution of the naval operation. Even the politicians and generals who insisted that the activists were “al-Qaeda-linked mercenaries who laid an ambush for our soldiers” could not cogently explain why the naval commando unit had fallen straight into this ambush.  Within the army, there was finger-pointing at the intelligence branch, which had failed to predict the reception awaiting the troops. Within the cabinet, recriminations have begun. There were even brief mutterings among Binyamin Netanyahu's aides about the impetuosity of Ehud Barak, the defence minister, who had decided on the operation. But these were quickly squelched. Plainly the prime minister is not prepared to target, and risk losing, the leader of the Labour Party who has become his close political ally.   The prime minister was on a visit to Canada when things went horribly wrong. He was due to see Barack Obama in the White House the next day for what the Americans were billing as a fence-mending meeting after months of public tension. He hesitated, but eventually cancelled the meeting and flew home. The White House apparently was not offering the beleaguered prime minister a shoulder-to-shoulder public appearance alongside Mr Obama to help fend off the criticism. A spokesman said Mr Netanyahu had an open invitation to return. Meanwhile, Mr Obama will be meeting the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Washington on June 9th in an effort to salvage the recently started “proximity” peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Hamas, triumphant at the turn of events, has urged the authority to break off the talks. The immediate task for Israel is to enlist American help in order to preclude international demands for an external inquiry, which it fears would be weighted against it. According to Israeli sources, America is said to be urging Mr Netanyahu to appoint without delay an Israeli inquiry under a High Court judge. But, at the same time, Israeli officials fear that diplomatic help from Washington to ease the crisis will come with a “price tag” in the peace negotiations. In the Israeli peace camp, people positively hope that this will be the case.  Israeli diplomats and soldiers are working the phones to Istanbul to try to prevent a complete rupture of relations with Turkey. The two countries, and especially their military establishments, have developed over decades a strategic alliance that has been a discreet but important axis of power in the region. But relations have recently soured with Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, repeatedly and vehemently criticising Israel's policies towards Gaza (see article). A further deterioration would quickly follow if Turkey sent its own navy to escort future blockade-busting ships; Israel has said that it would stop any such attempt. The Gazan pressure-cooker Not only Israel but America and the other Western countries which helped to isolate Gaza as a means of combating Hamas are now under pressure to rethink the blockade's efficacy. Israel does not bear sole responsibility, the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, pointed out this week. “For years, many in the international community have been complicit in a policy that aimed at isolating Gaza in the hope of weakening Hamas. This policy is morally appalling and politically self-defeating. It has harmed the people of Gaza without loosening Hamas's control.” The policy began within weeks of Israel's pull-out from Gaza in 2005. At the start, America tried to keep the gates open, brokering an Agreement on Movement and Access with Israel to allow the export from Gaza of hundreds of trucks of produce a day, regular bus convoys to and from the West Bank and the opening of a Palestinian-controlled crossing at Rafah to Egypt. But the agreement was in ink only. After just one year Gaza's exports stood at a mere 8% of the agreed amount, Rafah was closed and the buses never came. Once the strip was under Hamas's total control, Israel declared it a hostile entity, and prevented movement to and from the territory. Initially Hamas and other militant groups, drunk on their self-claimed success in forcing Israel's departure, sought to fight their way out with projectiles. The number of mostly home-made rockets hitting Israel rose from 281 in 2004 to 1,750 in 2008; and their range rose from a few kilometres to reach Tel Aviv's outskirts. But stung by the ferocity of Israel's reprisals, most lethally in the January 2009 war, Hamas reined in its fire and forced others to do likewise. So far this year 34 rockets have landed in Israel, none launched by Hamas. “Hamas is defending Israel,” chuckles an Israeli foreign ministry official. Instead Hamas has turned its energies inward. With Gazans locked inside the 40km by 10km (154 square-mile) strip, the siege has given Hamas a free hand to mould the place. Its leaders liken Gaza to a ribat, a warrior monastery, and its inmates to murabitoun, or militant monks, recalling the 11th-century revivalist movement which withdrew to the Moroccan highlands before sweeping onto the Moroccan plains and Andalusia. They regale the struggle to survive with the same terminology they once used for fighting Israel. To ensure supplies they created a “resistance” economy, supervising the digging of an elaborate web of tunnels snaking under Gaza's border with Egypt. At first the resistance economy failed to meet people's needs. But today, thanks to the tunnels, Gaza's shop shelves are brimming with goods that often arrive cheaper and faster than when Israel opened the gates. Winches hoist in aggregates, allowing a spate of road repairs and housing construction. The authorities have filled in the craters in the football stadia left by Israel's bombs and adorned the highways with cat's eyes. Unlike post-war repairs elsewhere, the reconstruction is home-grown. Hamstrung by their own restrictions which prevent them buying smuggled goods, the UN and other international agencies have written themselves out of the repair effort. Unable to bring in cement to repair its schools, UNRWA, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency which educates half of Gaza's children, arranged to teach children in shipping containers, before Israel banned those too.  Humanitarian agencies, with an eye on external financing, bewail the lack of development. But their indices miss the point. Gaza is redeveloping, and Hamas is making society in its own image. Huge amounts now pass through the tunnel shafts each year, creating a new economy from which Hamas creams a handsome share of the profits to finance its rule. “The siege is a gift,” says a Hamas minister.  Co-ordinating the effort is a remarkably well-oiled bureaucracy. To finance its half-billion-dollar annual budget, the Hamas government has instituted an effective tax regime, raising duties on tunnel imports, including cigarettes, petrol, clothes and bread. Officials claim to have achieved self-sufficiency in melons (piled high on the roadsides) and onions; and the price of eggs has fallen to half what it is in the West Bank. With fishing in the seas restricted by Israel's navy, Hamas is opening fish-farms in former Israeli settlements. Its institutions publish online compendia of the government's directives, the results of civil service exams (based, they claim, on merit, not factional allegiance), and send text messages to the lucky few cleared for travel to Egypt to update them on bus and crossing times.  More damagingly for Gaza's people, the siege has also allowed for much greater control. Manned by militants from its Ezz al-Din al-Qassam brigades hitherto deployed against Israel, Hamas's internal security applies the brigades' blinkered codes to harness society. This has created stability but at the price of a reign of fear. When rival Islamists decried Hamas's rule in Rafah, the militants stormed the mosque and killed its worshippers. When leftists protested that the tax rises hit a people already burdened by siege, they were hauled to jail. The death penalty has been reinstituted. And insensitive to comparisons with Israel, Hamas's forces have bulldozed the homes of Gazans who had moved onto former settlement land without authorisation. A thriving political culture has been culled to a one-faction state.  Manning the institutions is a new generation of highly motivated Hamas cadres who unlike their seniors have not studied abroad and who, with their narrow horizons and siege-mentality, view outsiders, Palestinians and foreigners, with suspicion. Tensions have emerged with an older generation, including the prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, who after an attack on UN summer camps pleaded for tolerance.   End of some activists' adventure A few Hamas old-timers, educated in Moscow and Damascus, warned that in its hunger for power, the movement risks betraying its religious principles. Their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Hamas's second generation—the 30-somethings who have lived their life under occupation—revel in the authority of office though lacking a clear vision of what they intend to do with their power. Opening borders to allow Gazans to travel again and let other influences in could eat into that unfettered absolutism. But few international policymakers appear to know what to do or how. For three years the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank backed by Western paymasters has waged a beauty contest with its Hamas rivals; many there remain loth to improve Gaza's odds. Egypt remains wary of another Islamist neighbour (Sudan is headache enough). For Israel, the siege might not have freed the kidnapped Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, or squeezed Gazans' bellies to the point where they rise up against Hamas (both official justifications for the siege), but it has won the more valuable prize of a divided Palestinian polity. Much as Israel planted settlers to impede a two-state settlement, so, argue some, it has now successfully planted Hamas. In the wake of the international outcry, Israel and Egypt have both taken temporary remedial measures to ease their respective closures. But a more formal safety-valve is required. There are many ways to do this but each has its drawbacks. The airport has been put out of action by Israeli bombing. Constructing a sea port remains on hold because of lack of materials. Reopening the crossings with Israel would re-establish Gaza's ties with the rest of Palestine. But Hamas—as happy to disengage from Israel as Israel is from it—prefers opening Rafah on the Egyptian border as a gate to the Islamic world.  Regional and Western policymakers have tentatively hoped that intra-Palestinian reconciliation would end the siege. But advisers of President Abbas in Ramallah are suggesting something else. They are calling on him to head to Gaza immediately to emphasise his support for his besieged people and promote a federal arrangement under which the two governments might continue to rule under his baton. A vanguard was due in Gaza later this week despite Israeli and Hamas protests. If accompanied by the $4 billion odd that Arab and Western donors promised Gaza after the January 2009 war, such an arrangement might yet curry favour. But the prospects for a Palestinian rapprochement still look far more remote than the launch of another flotilla."
https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2010/08/16/why-israel-is-obsessed-with-iran,"ONE interesting thing about Jeffrey Goldberg's much-discussed article on Israel's approach to the Iranian nuclear threat is that it is not all that clear what the Iranian nuclear threat actually is. Mr Golberg establishes beyond any doubt that Israelis and their leaders believe that an Iran possessing nuclear weapons would be an existential threat to their country. But most of the Israeli officials he cites don't seem to believe that Iran would use, or deliver to proxies, nuclear weapons to attack Israel. Binyamin Netanyahu tells Mr Goldberg that the threat is not so much a direct attack as a shift in the balance of power in the Middle East, the prospect that Iran's proxies will enjoy a ""nuclear umbrella"" and other Islamic militants will be ""emboldened"". (It's not quite clear what a ""nuclear umbrella"" might mean. Does Mr Netanyahu think Iran would threaten to use nuclear weapons if Israel attacks Hizbollah or Hamas?) Ehud Barak is concerned that the anxiety of a nuclear-armed Iran will drive Israel's youth to gradually emigrate. Do these represent existential worries? Moreover, do they justify the bombing of Iran, with all the catastrophic political and economic consequences that Mr Goldberg lays out in his piece? Israelis are right to worry about an existential threat to their country. They are right to worry that their youth will gradually emigrate. They are right to worry, as Mr Netanyahu says he does, that Israel may lose its raison d'etre as a refuge for embattled Jewry, that Jews may be less safe in Israel than they are in the diaspora. But the source of the existential threat to Israel is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It is Palestinian terrorists who put Jews in Israel at risk; the grinding, never-ending low-level war in the West Bank and Gaza that drives Israel's youth to emigrate; and the demographic problem of Palestinian population growth that threatens to destroy Israel's character either as a democracy, or as a Jewish state. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been impossible to resolve both because of its viciously tangled concerns of security, religion and historical justice, and because of political defects on both sides. But on the Israeli side, the essential defect has been a lack of both the political conditions and the psychic equipment to address the nature of the conflict. Right-wing Israelis, who now constitute a majority of the electorate, have proven incapable of understanding themselves as occupiers, incapable of acknowledging the Palestinian claim to nationhood in Palestinian territory, and incapable of accepting that a Palestinian state must be created even if some level of terrorism continues. Many Israelis are unable to see themselves except as victims, threatened now, as throughout Jewish history, with annihilation by fanatical anti-Semites.  Mr Goldberg's article rightly focuses on the centrality of the Holocaust to the way Israeli leaders think about Iran. (Former Israeli Air Force general Ephraim Sneh points Mr Goldberg to a poster on his wall showing three Israeli F-15s flying over Auschwitz in 2003. ""We were too late,"" Mr Sneh says.) He fails to follow the insight through: to what extent does the Holocaust obsession irrationally distort the Israeli perspective on Iran? At some point, one has to wonder whether the Israeli conception of the Iranian nuclear threat as a second Holocaust represents a psychological projection of existential fears rooted in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The Palestinian conflict cannot be resolved without tremendous political sacrifice, and perhaps not at all. Israelis don't even know what tools they would need to resolve it. It's understandable if Israelis and their leaders react by displacing their anxieties onto an enemy they can put in the familiar role of a Hitler or a Haman, one they can engage with a tool that gives them a familiar feeling of control and power: their air force. I remember the first time I heard an Israeli friend raise anxieties about the Iranian threat. It was during a discussion of the collapse of the Palestinian peace process in the aftermath of the second intifadah. I couldn't figure out what the Iranian nuclear programme had to do with Israel's engagement with the Palestinians. But the gist of my friend's point was, look, why should we be expected to make sacrifices in this infuriating process with the corrupt Palestinian Authority and the Hamas crazies, when even if we could somehow reach a deal, the Iranians are building a bomb to try and kill us all? I may not be presenting my friend's point fairly, but it tipped me off to the temptation, for Israelis, of invoking of the Iranian threat as a way to retreat from the exhausting, painful, perhaps impossible task of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One of Mr Goldberg's interviewees pulls the same self-serving psychological trick when he worries that Barack Obama is a ""J Street Jew"": “We're worried that he thinks like the liberal American Jews who say, ‘If we remove some settlements, then the extremist problem and the Iran problem go away.'” Liberal American Jews do not think the Iran problem will ""go away"" if Israel ""removes some settlements."" Rather, they think that Israel is doomed if it fails to remove most or all of the settlements and cooperate in the creation of a Palestinian state, and that Israelis, incapable of confronting this fact, are pretending to themselves that the real problem lies elsewhere. On the Iranian side, it would be hard for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to do anything more perfectly calibrated to provoke an Israeli attack than pursuing nuclear weapons while denying that the Holocaust took place. Mr Ahmadinejad, a first-caliber incendiary nationalist politician, may well understand this perfectly, and his gratuitous finger-in-the-eye Holocaust denials may be intended to bring on an airstrike that would benefit him politically. But this only highlights how Israel is rendered vulnerable by its tendency to view the world through the distorting prism of the Holocaust. The Holocaust prism leads Israelis and their leaders to adopt inappropriate, self-defeating, violent policies, in much the way that the American tendency to view the world through the distorting prism of the Cold War led us to adopt inappropriate, self-defeating, violent policies in response to the September 11th attacks. The Israeli assessment of the Iranian nuclear threat should be viewed sceptically especially because of the ways it is bound up with Holocaust thinking. If the Israeli desire to bomb Iran is unreasonable and rooted in historical trauma, then the challenge facing American leaders is different from the one Mr Goldberg describes. The challenge is not solely to ensure at a great level of certainty that Iran does not obtain a nuclear device. The challenge is also to dissuade Israel from launching a catastrophic attack on Iran.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2010/08/05/triangle-of-trouble," A Bedou's quiet day at the office SINAI is best known as a place where the ancient prophet Moses met God and modern tourists frolic in fancy resorts. But for Egypt, which fought three wars against Israel to assert ownership rights that go back to Pharaonic times, this prized province has lately proved bothersome.  The latest trouble has not reached the scale of 2004-06, when a series of al-Qaeda-style bombings struck beaches in southern Sinai, killing around 130 people. Still, recent incidents that range from anti-government protests by native Sinai Bedouin, to firefights with smugglers, to deadly police fire directed at refugees, to the launching of rockets from Sinai into neighbouring Israel and Jordan, suggest a sudden surge of problems.  On August 2nd at least five short-range rockets, almost certainly fired from nearby in the Sinai desert, smacked into the cluttered northern rim of the Gulf of Aqaba, where the twin Israeli and Jordanian ports of Eilat and Aqaba sit back-to-back (see map). Four exploded harmlessly, but one killed a driver outside a Jordanian hotel and wounded five others. It was the second such attack since April. Egypt's security forces seem unable to block what are presumably jihadist infiltrators, lugging launchers with projectiles three metres long to within a few kilometres of Egypt's border with Israel, which stretches around 250km (160 miles).  On July 24th and again on July 29th, Egyptian police did shoot dead unarmed African migrants attempting to cross that border. The victims were refugees, from Sudan and Eritrea, seeking work or political asylum in Israel. So far this year, Egypt's shoot-to-kill policy has claimed at least 21 lives, up from 19 for all of 2009. Citing pressure from Israel to curb the migrants, and the danger of clashes with the well-armed smugglers that guide them, Egypt has shrugged off pressure from human-rights groups and from the UN to find more humane methods of stanching the traffic.  Both the rockets and the killings of refugees point up the broader problem of strained relations between Egypt's central government and the Sinai Bedouin, whose numbers have soared owing to high fertility rates since the peninsula was returned to Egypt in 1982 after 15 years of Israeli occupation. Native tribes in the north of the peninsula complain they have been marginalised and left impoverished, while Egyptians from the Nile Valley have colonised choice lands on its southern coast for tourism. Smuggling, their ancient pastime, has lately become more lucrative, more necessary for survival and more dangerous. The Israeli blockade of Gaza has provided one big market, via tunnels. But people, drugs and weapons all pass across Sinai's rugged mountainous terrain, aided by the Bedouins' tracking skills and tight kinship bonds, as well as by the susceptibility of Egypt's police to bribery.  The Egyptian government's longstanding suspicion of the Bedouin took a sinister turn following the 2004-06 resort bombings. In the course of crushing a jihadist cell in Sinai that was alleged to have carried them out, as many as 3,000 other people were arrested, and many were held for long periods without charge under Egypt's harsh emergency laws. The brutal policing campaign has left lingering bitterness, which erupted earlier this year in strikes, protest marches and scattered attacks on government facilities. Belatedly, Egypt's ministry of interior has sought to calm the unrest. After meetings with tribal leaders, it has freed several dozen Bedouin detainees. Other ministries have promised to bring more jobs and investment. Israel, for its part, is planning to build a fence along some of its border. Perhaps, some day, the Sinai will emerge from its years in the wilderness. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2010/02/25/not-such-a-success,"WITH a lot less exposure in the world’s press than it got for its recent Dubai operation, Israel has quietly suffered a string of setbacks in Lebanon, a front-line state with which it has often been at war. Lebanon’s security service says that since November 2008 it has broken up no fewer than 25 Israeli spy rings. The reported arrest this month of a colonel in Lebanese army intelligence, identified solely by the initials GS, brings the number of those charged to 70-plus; 40 of them are in Lebanese police custody. For a force better known for its failure to manage traffic, let alone resolve Lebanon’s sorry catalogue of political murders, the counter-intelligence sweep is an unprecedented coup. The arrests are said to have exposed a series of agents for Israel, ranging from a retired Lebanese army general who ran a housecleaning service to a garage owner who specialised in supplying Hizbullah, Lebanon’s Shia party-cum-militia, with vehicles that he secretly fitted with tracking devices. Some are said to have worked for the Israelis since the 1980s, whereas others were recruited after Israel’s war against Hizbullah in 2006. Earlier this month a Lebanese court sentenced two such agents to death for blowing up a Palestinian Islamist leader and his brother in a car in 2006. One is charged separately with killing two top Hizbullah men, as well as the son of Ahmad Jibril, past head of a Palestinian guerrilla group.  Aside from the alleged spies, the Lebanese say they netted fancy surveillance and communications gear disguised, among other innocuous things, as Thermos flasks, canisters of motor oil and battery chargers. The gadgetry may be what gave the game away. Security sources hint that France or perhaps Russia helped the Lebanese by supplying sophisticated systems to monitor and analyse the telecoms data. The Lebanese then homed in on suspicious signals.  Another clue may have pointed to the importance of the signals trail. Last summer, as the spies were being rounded up, a senior man in Unit 8200, the section of Israeli military intelligence tasked with eavesdropping on Israel’s enemies, shot himself in his office. Colleagues blamed “unrequited love”."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2011/12/10/oh-no-but-lets-talk-maybe,"THE election results in Egypt are an Islamist “hurricane”, “deluge” or “tsunami”, according to Israeli newspaper headlines. The defence minister, Ehud Barak, called them “very worrisome”. Officials, sounding cool, noted that there were precious few relations left to break, since Egypt had long been severing ties to punish Israel for refusing to yield to the Palestinians in the peace process. Egyptian-Israeli agricultural schemes long ago ground to a halt. Factories with Israeli links that had profited from tariff-free exports to the United States have shut. Since Egypt's revolution began in January, Israeli tourists have virtually stopped coming. This year Egyptian militants have blown up a pipeline pumping Egyptian gas to Israel nine times. And Israel's embassy in Cairo remains closed. It could get worse. Before the Camp David peace accords were signed 33 years ago, Israel's front with Egypt was its most menacing—and it could become so again. The Muslim Brotherhood's Palestinian branch, Hamas, which, to Israel's chagrin, still rules the Gaza Strip between Israel and Egypt, hopes that better relations with a new Islamist-oriented Egyptian government will bolster it. Farther south, Egypt's Sinai peninsula is becoming a lawless no-man's-land, with Bedouin and Islamist militants at large. Yet Israel is loth to attack them, lest it ignite a broader war. When Israeli troops shot back at militants dressed in Egyptian army uniforms who killed eight Israelis near a Red Sea resort on the Israeli side of the border in August, Egyptian protesters stormed the Israeli embassy in Cairo. Another such attack might rupture Egyptian-Israeli diplomatic relations altogether. Even if Egypt's Islamists refrain from scrapping the peace treaty, Israel fears they will seek to amend the clauses that provide for Sinai's demilitarisation. They might even put the treaty to a referendum. The Salafists, though declaring themselves non-violent at present, could yet—Israelis fear—turn jihadist. Israel's generals are already battening down the hatches. They have speeded the construction of a vast concrete wall along Israel's 240-km (150-mile) border with Egypt and deployed another brigade to patrol it. Drones peer over the border at Sinai. Some Israeli generals hope that old ties with their Egyptian counterparts will survive. They may be too optimistic. If the Islamists end up ruling Egypt, might they seek to engage with Israel? Precedent is not encouraging. When Hamas won the Palestinian elections in 2006 and then asserted sole control over Gaza the following year, Israel opted for boycott and siege unless Hamas recognised Israel, among other things. After President Hosni Mubarak's fall in February, Israeli diplomats in Cairo suggested making overtures to the Muslim Brotherhood, only to be told from on high to desist. Israelis often reckon that order, even if imposed by a hostile entity, is better than chaos. (This may apply to Syria under the Assad family too.) Moreover, thanks to Israel's indirect and informal contacts with Hamas, a modicum of peace has returned to Gaza. “With Hamas, we can do whatever we wish,” says an Israeli who talks to it. Calming pragmatic statements by Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Cairo hint at an accommodation. Muhammad Salem Awa, a leading Brother, condemned the attack on Israel's embassy. The Brothers' election manifesto says that Egypt's international agreements must be upheld, presumably including those with Israel. The Brothers' desire for good relations with the West and for tourism to revive will make a confrontation less likely. In a sign of things to come, Rachid Ghannouchi, head of Nahda, the Tunisian Islamists who are close to the Brotherhood, recently met Israelis discreetly in Washington. He said that Tunisia's constitution would not ban further contact. “The new political Islam is more realistic,” says Israel's outgoing ambassador to Egypt, Yitzhak Levanon, who wants to engage. For decades Israel's security people ran policy with Egypt. But as generals lose power across the region, Israel's politicians, including religious ones, may try their hand. “Men of religion understand each other better,” says the religious-affairs minister, Yaakov Margov of Shas, one of two Orthodox parties in Israel's ruling coalition. “I am ready to meet the Brotherhood any time, any place,” he says. His party leader, Eli Yishai, once even offered to meet Hamas, until others in Israel's then government reined him in."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2011/01/20/can-the-doves-take-off-again," AFTER Binyamin Netanyahu's coalition recently shrank from 74 seats to 66 in Israel's 120-seat parliament, he insisted that his government had become stronger. Maybe so. But the opposition has got stronger too, as well as larger. Israelis who bank on peace through negotiation with the Palestinians may have a chance to revive. The coalition shrinkage was caused by a split in the Labour party, always a restless partner. Labour's leader, Ehud Barak, the minister of defence, quit his party, together with four other members of parliament, setting up a new faction called “Independence”. The reduced Labour party, now numbering just eight parliamentarians, has gone over to the opposition. The shake-up, as Mr Netanyahu points out, makes his rightist-religious coalition more cohesive ideologically, and thus, he hopes, more disciplined politically. But by consolidating the hawks, the new alignment may also unify and perk up the doves in Israel's aviary. There is a rare flutter of excitement on Israel's left. Mr Barak's move, excoriated by the Labour rump as opportunistic, is the latest in a series of mergers and secessions that has eroded the old pattern of Israeli politics. For decades a “national camp” comprising the Likud and its allies was pitted against a “peace camp” made up of Labour and like-minded parties, including Israeli-Arab parties. The religious parties were in the middle, inclined to the nationalists but always ready to negotiate with the peaceniks if the parliamentary arithmetic warranted it.  The most cataclysmic of those shifts was in 2005, when the then prime minister, Ariel Sharon, seceded from the Likud to create Kadima, now the largest party in parliament (see chart). This shift had been preceded in the late 1990s by the rise of two new parties: Shinui, an anti-clerical outfit founded by Tommy Lapid, and Yisrael Beitenu, a far-right party, backed mainly by Russian immigrants, led by Avigdor Lieberman. Shinui, a linchpin of Mr Sharon's governments between 2001 and 2006, has since disappeared as swiftly as it arose. Israel's fluid and fickle party structure reflected a blurring of the old hawk-dove demarcation. The Likud, like Kadima and Labour, purported to support (or at least to acquiesce in) the view that the Israel-Palestine conflict can be solved by creating two sovereign states existing side by side. That was Mr Netanyahu's message to the world after he took office in 2009. His generous disbursement of ministries to Labour was meant to keep onside Mr Barak, a former prime minister in a doveish coalition from 2000-2001, lending credibility to his professed desire to negotiate peace. But that credibility has been fizzling at home and abroad, since Mr Netanyahu refused to meet the minimal demand of his Palestinian interlocutors (and of Western mediators) that Israel should stop expanding Jewish settlements on the West Bank, the main bit of the Palestinians' would-be state. Labour's break-up may help reclarify the old hawk-dove ornithology. The evolving demarcation is between Israelis who still want, above all, to end the occupation of the Palestinian territories by negotiation or else by unilateral withdrawal, and those (now apparently including Mr Netanyahu) who prefer to stay put, for religious, nationalist or, as many more middle-of-the-road Israelis see it, security reasons. Could a reconsolidated peace camp win back the middle-of-the-roaders? Tzipi Livni, Kadima's leader, has done well to hold her own ranks together, talking tough on security but consistently arguing for negotiation with the Palestinians. She may pull in some moderate Likud people unhappy with a series of bills before parliament that seem to discriminate against Israeli-Arabs and constrict freedoms. Mr Lieberman, the foreign minister, repulses many in the middle of Israel's spectrum with his verbal assaults on human-rights groups, accusing them of treachery. Meanwhile there is speculation that a new secular centrist party may emerge before the next election, set for 2012 unless the government falls before then. A popular broadcaster, Yair Lapid, son of the late Shinui leader, is said to be mulling his prospects. The guess is that he would rather align with Kadima than with the Likud. A regrouping of social democrats on Kadima's left flank, with Meretz and Labour to the fore, is also being mooted. That is the hope of Isaac Herzog, minister of welfare until the recent split, who intends (among several others) to run for the Labour leadership. The scion of a patrician family—his uncle was Abba Eban, a longtime foreign minister, and his father, Chaim, was Israel's president—Mr Herzog says Labour must recover the social democratic values of the party's founding fathers. But would that provide the basis of a ruling coalition on the centre-left with the clout to cut a deal with the Palestinians? That remains a speculation too far. "
https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2011/09/28/on-claims-of-palestinian-anti-semitism,"ROBERT BERNSTEIN is one of the founding figures of Human Rights Watch, and for the last several years he's been criticising the group he helped found for what he says is an anti-Israeli bias. Today he has an op-ed in the Washington Post that extends the indictment, rather more plausibly, to the United Nations. Mr Bernstein calls on the UN to acknowledge and condemn what he says is a constant stream of hateful, anti-Zionist, often anti-Semitic and genocidal propaganda generated in the Arab media and by Arab leaders, which he thinks lays the groundwork for endless conflict. The UN, he says, is ""fueling discord and anti-Semitism"" by ""granting legitimacy to Hamas, a terrorist Islamic group, and the Palestinian Authority headed by Mahmoud Abbas."" And he provides an example of Mr Abbas, widely viewed even in Israel as a peace-seeking believer in non-violent negotiations, engaging in what sounds like some pretty violent rhetoric: Whoa. That's a doozy. Mahmoud Abbas, saying Palestinians refuse to recognise Israel? Is Mr Abbas concealing a secret eliminationist agenda? Well, no. Take a look at MEMRI's translation of what Mr Abbas actually said. (MEMRI is the same pro-Israeli Arab media-monitoring organisation to which Mr Bernstein himself refers.) What Mr Abbas is objecting to here is Israeli insistence that the Palestinian Authority recognise its character as a Jewish state as part of any peace agreement. He's not saying the Palestinians will not recognise Israel. He's not even saying they won't recognise its right to exist. He's saying the Palestinians refuse to be singled out, as Egypt and Jordan were not when they signed peace deals with Israel, and forced to approve the religious Jewish character of the state. Israel never demanded this recognition during peace negotiations in the 1990s or early 2000s. They're not part of the Clinton administration-mediated Taba agreements or the Bush administration-brokered ""road map"" for peace. The Israelis first introduced the demand in 2007. Here is the response, laid out in the talking points of the Palestinian negotiating team in 2007, made public by Al-Jazeera's transparency project: Hussein Ibish made similar points earlier this year in Foreign Policy. Some people may disagree with these arguments, but they're hardly anti-Semitic or violent. The issue of the Jewish character of the Israeli state is a profoundly difficult one even for liberal Zionist Jews, who wrestle with how such a legal character can be squared with the principles of secular government and equality for all citizens before the law. It's certainly understandable that Palestinians refuse to condone what they consider an objectionable aspect of Israeli governance as part of a peace deal. Would America have agreed to recognise the right of Vietnam to exist as a Communist state in the Paris peace talks in 1972? If Mr Bernstein wants to make a case that by recognising a Palestinian state the UN would be sanctioning anti-Semitic or violent anti-Israeli propaganda, he'll need to find some better examples."
https://www.economist.com/newsbook/2012/02/18/getting-friendly,"RUSSIAN and Chinese companies may soon join an American one drilling for gas in the sea off Cyprus, the Cypriot president, Demetris Christofias, told Israel's Binyamin Netanyahu in Nicosia on Thursday February 17th. Mr Netanyahu agreed that such vicarious super-power involvement could offer Cyprus a measure of deterrence against Turkish threats over sea rights. Israel is keen to be involved in Cyprus's offshore bonanza. “The sum can be greater than its two parts,” Mr Netanyahu says, suggesting that the two eastern Mediterranean maritime neighbours could cooperate in liquefying, transporting and selling the gas bonanzas each has discovered under the stretch of water between them. Part of the gas reservoir extends across the line in the sea that the two states agreed in December 2010 to demarcate their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs). They are now negotiating a “unitisation agreement” that would regulate their respective rights in shared fields. “It took 63 years to make this 45-minute trip,” Mr Netanyahu said on Thursday, arriving for the first-ever visit by an Israeli prime minister to Cyprus. Frigid relations between the two countries have warmed dramatically of late as both contemplate the prospect of sizable gas revenues. Israel's rupture with Turkey has prompted its new friendship with both Cyprus and Greece. Mr Netanyahu speaks euphorically of a ‘western arc' of Israeli friends, including Romania and Bulgaria. The Israeli air force has been running exercises in the skies over Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, as it once used to do over Turkey.But the Israeli prime minister and his aides denied reports that Israel might station war-planes on Cyprus. A search-and-rescue agreement signed during Mr Netanyahu's one-day visit to Nicosia was just that, the Israelis insisted, not a cover for other military activity. The Cypriot leader seemed comfortable with the heightened speculation surrounding Mr Netanyahu's visit. Yes, he said at a press conference, they had talked about the security of the off-shore installations, but discussing these matters publicly “would not be wise.” Both countries wanted to produce gas peacefully and have no interest in warmongering, Mr Christofias added. But the day before, the Cypriot president continued, Turkey had reiterated its “provocative and aggressive stance”, and warned Cyprus that it should not proceed with a new round of tenders for prospecting contracts. Choppier waters may lie ahead."
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2012/07/28/alive-and-well,"JUDAISM IS FLOURISHING, both in Israel, where 43% of the world’s Jews now live, and throughout the Jewish diaspora. The Jews as a nation are flourishing too. Israelis, for all their problems, are the 14th-happiest people in the world, happier than the British or the French, according to a recent global happiness report commissioned by the UN. In the diaspora Jewish life has never been so free, so prosperous, so unthreatened. In America an observant Jew, Senator Joseph Lieberman, ran for vice-president in 2000. With Al Gore as candidate for president, he nearly made it. His Jewish faith was no drawback, he says; rather, it appealed to many Christian voters who take their own religion seriously. Mr Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, “were dreaming of a large suka” (a rustic hut covered with branches in which Jews eat and entertain during the Sukot harvest festival) in the grounds of the vice-president’s residence. “We felt we could be ourselves.” Had he had gone on to run for the White House, as he hoped, “I’d have been observant there, too.” “Jewish is cool in America,” says J.J. Goldberg, a writer. “Celebrities used to change their names to hide their Jewish identity. Now they talk on television about how they try to instil Jewish identity into their half-Jewish children. Take [the actress] Gwyneth Paltrow. Her father is a descendant of rabbis; her mother is a Protestant from middle America. She writes in her food blog about her favourite kosher recipes for the seder [the family prayer-dinner celebrating the Passover spring festival]. Seders are popular with non-Jewish people. Bar-mitzva [the coming-of-age-ceremony] has become stylish, too. Kids see it on television; they see their friends having it—and they want it as well.” In the smaller diaspora communities, too, Jews are prospering, though there is nowhere with quite that same sense of complete, seamless belonging as in America. In Russia and Ukraine, where Judaism and Zionism were repressed in communist times, Jews are prominent in business. Jewish philanthropy is rebuilding community life for those who opted to stay rather than emigrate to Israel or the West. Israel and the Jewish diaspora, moreover, are in strong and loyal alignment. Diaspora Jews, broadly speaking, love and cherish Israel. They support it against its enemies, real and perceived, they back its government and they resent its critics. None of this could have been predicted just a few decades ago. Hitler had wiped out one-third of the Jewish people. A thousand years of Jewish civilisation in central and eastern Europe had been swept away. Fortunately for Jewish survival, the Nazis’ “final solution” had been preceded by a flurry of pogroms across the then-tsarist empire that started 60 years earlier, sending waves of mass Jewish emigration westward. By the time Hitler struck, some 6m Jews were safe in North and South America and in Britain, with 3m more living in the Soviet Union. Traditional religious learning and observance had been on the defensive in central and eastern Europe for 150 years, since political emancipation in parts of the region opened the gates of ghettoes and tradition in the shtetls (small Jewish communities) was shaken up. Now the old life was annihilated, along with much of modern, liberal Jewish culture. The Sephardic communities of north Africa and the Levant, long a minority within Jewry, gained new numerical significance. Together with the pitifully few survivors of Nazi-occupied Europe, they became the core population of the new state of Israel. Ben-Gurion’s error Its founding fathers, socialist-Zionists in the main, thought that the vestiges of the old religion would soon disappear. David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, held that the 2,000 years of diasporic Judaism were a deviation from the true fulfilment of the Jewish ethos. The Talmud (Judaism’s ancient body of law and lore) was too casuistic, he felt; the new state must hark back to the Bible. But he agreed to exempt a few hundred Talmud students from army service, confident they were a dying breed. Before the Holocaust, Zionism, the movement for Jewish independence in Palestine, had to struggle for Jewish popular support. Now it was vindicated, at least in its own eyes. But some Jews, especially in America, were still not convinced. Israel, fighting for its survival, flooded by destitute immigrants, looked precarious to them. In America assimilation was the watchword. Attenuated forms of religious practice that originated in 19th century Germany were embraced by the upwardly mobile children and grandchildren of the immigrant generation. American Jews’ standoffishness towards their Jewish nationhood shifted sharply after the six-day war in 1967. The collective experience of fear, and then relief and jubilation, produced an outpouring of solidarity with the beleaguered Jewish state. Mixed in with these emotions was a sense of unease, even guilt, over the ineffectiveness of American Jewish lobbying during the Holocaust to get President Roosevelt to rescue Jews. Sociologists say that Israel—and fundraising and lobbying on its behalf—became American Jewry’s “secular religion”. A vocal grassroots campaign to free emigration for Soviet Jewry also attracted wide support, especially among younger Jews. By the turn of the 21st century, moreover, post-modernism was cocking an unexpected snook both at dogmatic Israeli Godlessness and at diaspora assimilationism. “Post-modernism has been kind to all religions,” says Moshe Halbertal, a philosopher living in Jerusalem. “Reason was dethroned; there’s no large narrative out there any more.” Hyphenated ethnicities and identities encourage people to enjoy and display their diversities instead of keeping them out of sight. Many diaspora Jews today still drift out of Judaism or out of Jewishness, or choose to leave. But many others are consciously deciding to stay in, choosing one of myriad new ways to express their commitment. Exactly what defines Jewishness remains a matter of much debate. This special report will concentrate on those who formally identify with the faith (see table for the main denominations), but in Israel even the non-religious are influenced by Jewish culture and mores. Jewish Orthodoxy has come surging back. Early marriages and high birth rates have produced a demographic explosion among the ultra-Orthodox haredim (God-fearers). This has pumped up their numbers, compensating for the steady outflow from active Judaism caused by assimilation. The overall total of Jews worldwide is somewhat higher than it was 40 years ago (see chart above). By conservative estimates, one in ten Jews is now haredi. The “modern-Orthodox” account for another 10%. Many Israelis like to think of themselves as “traditional”. But even the avowedly secular live Jewish lives, and indeed religious lives, in many subliminal ways; and Israel increasingly radiates its national, cultural and religious Jewishness into the diaspora communities. Following the collapse of the peace process with the Palestinians in 2000 and the violent intifada (uprising) that followed, Israeli political attitudes have palpably hardened. In theory, all Israeli mainstream parties are committed to a “two-state solution”; in practice, the growing modern-Orthodox settler movement in the West Bank spearheads a government policy of occupation without end. To sustain and justify that policy, a stridently nationalistic Zeitgeist is evolving. In the absence of progress towards peace, that may be inevitable. Perhaps it is inevitable, too, that it is winning the soul of diaspora Jewry. Our kind of peace Doubtless most members of a non-Orthodox synagogue in suburban Connecticut, like most Israelis and diaspora Jews, would tell pollsters that they support peace and two states. The atmosphere there on a recent Sunday could hardly have been more civilised. Jews, Christians and Muslims munched hot dogs and coleslaw together before setting out to clean up the neighbourhood park. The rabbi spoke words of appropriate interfaith inspiration. In the library the synagogue staff had spread carpets on the floor for the Muslims to pray. In the corridor outside this temporary mosque, two Muslim schoolboys read the Israeli declaration of independence: “We extend our hand of peace and unity to all the neighbouring states and their peoples.” It was displayed alongside a map of the region. “No Gaza,” one noted. “No West Bank either,” his brother added. A synagogue warden explained later that the map was “biblical, not political”. The prevailing political sentiment in Jewry today is of aggressive defensiveness, a curious amalgam of victimhood and intolerance. Dissent about Israel is discouraged and often gagged outright. Among British Jewry, some 300,000 strong, “a positively McCarthyite atmosphere has been created,” says Jonathan Freedland, a political columnist. “People are frightened to say what they feel.” In America “honest discussion about Israel is largely shut down,” notes Arnold Eisen, a historian and chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, a rabbinical school in New York. “Some rabbis will speak their minds…but people don’t want to fight and there is a disinclination to argue about Israel. The right says you’re giving aid and comfort to the enemy if you say anything critical about any Israeli policy.” Given Israel’s power and diaspora Jewry’s strength and influence, that seems paradoxical. Resurgent religious faith is deeply caught up in this. Nationalism, xenophobia and Judaism blur and merge. Jews find themselves out of step with most of world opinion, which heightens a widespread sense of apprehensiveness. Iran’s threats and nuclear pretensions provide a focus for these feelings. Diaspora Jewish leaders insist that Israel is misunderstood. They attribute criticism to anti-Semitism, which is rising again. Arthur Green, a scholar of Jewish mysticism and a professor at a rabbinical school in Boston, blames Israel’s policy and American Jewry’s blanket support for it “for the fact that lots and lots of thinking Jews are walking away. And then we say, well, they’re not committed Jews anyway, so who cares about them?” The accusation that Israeli hawkishness turns young diaspora Jews off their Judaism and their Jewishness has been trenchantly advanced by Peter Beinart, a journalist in Washington, DC. It has caused huge controversy among American Jewry. But many other experts deny the causal link. Jews, especially younger ones, have been dropping out in large numbers for years, Mr Eisen points out. As their attachment to Judaism weakens, so does their commitment to Israel. Those who criticise Israel and incur the community’s wrath care at least as much as those who try to silence them. “Love has a voice,” he insists."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2012/12/08/barriers-to-peace,"RARELY has Israel looked lonelier. On November 29th only the United States, Canada and the Czech Republic among serious countries backed its arguments at the United Nations’ General Assembly against giving the Palestinians an enhanced status at the UN. Now Binyamin Netanyahu’s government has declared its determination to build thousands of new Jewish houses on the West Bank, where the Palestinians hope to turn their virtual state into a real one (see article). It also says it will withhold tax revenues from the Palestinian Authority (PA), which runs parts of the West Bank under Israeli eyes, to punish the Palestinians for their cheek at the UN. This time, even the Americans objected. Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, chastised Mr Netanyahu for his response. The mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, who used to be President Barack Obama’s chief of staff and is a firm supporter of Israel, called it a betrayal of America’s friendship. It is not hard to see why. The decision to withhold the taxes is probably just a temporary punishment. But it will hardly help the more moderate Palestinians of Fatah, which runs the West Bank under Mahmoud Abbas, in favour of Hamas, its Gaza-based rival, which is still loth to accept Israel’s existence. The new settlements are far more serious. The houses Israel keeps on erecting on Palestinian territory are the main reason why so much of the world has lost sympathy for Israel’s cause. The Palestinians have had to watch the Israelis gobbling up the land on which their state is meant to be based. Worse, the latest planned settlement, in a zone known as E-1, threatens to box Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem, which they hope to make their capital, into a sealed-off enclave, impeding connections to the rest of the fledgling state of Palestine and bisecting the northern and southern halves. Travel from Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem, to Ramallah, the Palestinians’ administrative headquarters, would be a nightmare. Mr Netanyahu may try to justify his defiance over the settlements by pointing to the Palestinians’ unilateralism at the UN and the rockets from Gaza, though Israel has more than replied to them. He may also have an eye on the coming Israeli election. But for those, including this newspaper, who still hope for a two-state solution, the new houses are an impassable obstacle. Palestinian leaders cite them as further evidence that Israel has no interest in ceding territory, even for peace. True to that picture, although Mr Netanyahu endorsed a two-state solution in 2009, his Likud party hasn’t: some of its candidates still want a Greater Israel extending to the Jordan river. For Mr Obama, stuck in budget negotiations in Washington, this could not come at a worse time. But he should speak out loudly. Mr Obama’s envoys, just like the Europeans, have always stressed that building settlements in the E-1 corridor is unacceptable. Israel still gets billions of dollars from America, and might well rely on its help to attack Iran next year. Yet Mr Netanyahu would not have announced the settlements unless he thought he could get away with it. Israel has enough friends in Congress to protect his back. And thumbing his nose at Mr Obama has cost him nothing with Israeli voters. Speak now, Mr Obama, loudly A braver Mr Obama would this time tell Israel some home truths. Yes, many changes are necessary on the Palestinian side: Hamas needs to recognise Israel’s existence, for instance, and settle its differences with Fatah. But carving up a prospective Palestine and building a Greater Israel is destroying the prospects for peace. That is not just because it enrages the dispossessed Palestinians and their newly democratic Arab neighbours. It is also because of demographic trends within Israel. The Arab population is growing faster than the Jewish one. Under a single-state solution, Jews would become a minority. Unless they are prepared for Arabs to dominate the country politically, they will have to deprive them of the vote. The road Mr Netanyahu is pushing his country down is an ugly one—and Israel’s true friends should tell it so."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2012/06/02/keep-out,"ON MAY 28th it was the turn of Yorusalem Mestun, a 22-year-old Eritrean asylum-seeker in hot-pants. Five young Israelis smashed the glass door of her internet café and pulled a knife on her, while her Jewish neighbours looked on. The police came, checked her visa and left without, she said, offering help or sympathy. Attacks on Israel's fast-growing population of African asylum-seekers, mainly from South Sudan and Eritrea, are rising. Hundreds of Jews led by settlers from the West Bank, where Palestinians hope to create their state, recently marched through districts of south Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital, where black immigrants proliferate, chanting “Africans Out!” Pumped up with angry excitement, the middle-aged chef of a fast-food shop, in HaTikva, a working-class district where migrants are also settling in large numbers, offers passers-by “grilled kushi”, provocatively meaning “grilled blacks”, and suggests getting rid of the immigrants by throwing grenades at their tenements. In recent weeks, several homes and a kindergarten for Africans have been firebombed. Liberal Israelis have staged anti-racist rallies. A generation after their arrival, over 120,000 Ethiopian Jews have been integrated. The country has received an estimated 60,000 black asylum-seekers. It is not the first to struggle when large numbers of people suddenly arrive. On May 29th the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said he was adding African “infiltrators” to his list of threats to the Jewish homeland. He said he shared the rioters' pain and promised to solve the problem by completing a wall along the border with Egypt. He said he would also build the world's largest detention centre—and deport all those within, starting with the South Sudanese. Until 2009 the 15,000 or so asylum-seekers entering via Sinai every year were banned from coming within a radius of 30km (19 miles) of Tel Aviv. Since the government revoked that order, the security forces, after catching immigrants crossing, verify their identity and then pack them off to Tel Aviv. Scores of destitute new arrivals bed down every night in a park near the main bus station. Israeli officials say they are loth to improve conditions in case even more are encouraged to come. The interior ministry bans the immigrants from work and refuses to process asylum applications from friendly countries such as Eritrea, though it is a dictatorship. “How can a country founded by refugees turn against them?” asks Yohannes Bayu, an Ethiopian who arrived 15 years ago and now runs the country's only shelter for asylum-seekers."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2012/07/21/the-power-of-the-ultra-orthodox,"KADIMA, the centrist party that has the most seats in Israel’s parliament, has left Binyamin Netanyahu’s coalition government just ten weeks after joining it. This makes it far less likely that sweeping legislation will be enacted to draft haredi (ultra-Orthodox) men into the army. Haredim comprise 13% of draft-age Jewish youngsters, but their numbers are rising sharply: they make up more than a quarter of all Jewish children in their first year at primary school. It is an explosive issue. Without Kadima, the ruling coalition still has 66 of 120 parliamentary seats. But Mr Netanyahu will find it hard to push through a planned austerity budget in the autumn, and may find himself forced to hold early elections. He had hoped that his government would rule until Parliament’s term ends in October next year. Whenever the election is held, haredi draft-dodging—as secular Israelis see it—is now likely to feature as a campaign issue. The present regulations, enabling haredim not to serve so long as they remain in their yeshivas (religious seminaries), have been ruled discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. They will lapse on July 31st. They have led in practice to more than 60% of male haredim being unemployed, hugely increasing the welfare burden of Israeli taxpayers. This engenders deep resentment among secular and “modern-Orthodox” Israelis, who have to serve in the army for three years; women serve for two. Kadima’s leader, Shaul Mofaz, bitterly accused the prime minister of kowtowing to the two haredi parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, rather than backing a parliamentary committee’s draft bill designed to force most haredi youngsters to enlist. The committee, headed by a Kadima member, proposed strictly limited exemptions for outstanding students of the Talmud, Judaism’s ancient body of law and lore, in yeshivas. The rest would have to enlist in the army or do civilian service by the age of 22. Yisrael Beitenu, another coalition partner, takes an even tougher line. It submitted a bill on July 18th recommending universal national service for all citizens, Arabs as well as Jews, at the age of 18. Mr Netanyahu intends to submit his own bill to the cabinet providing for a phased enlistment of haredim, which would mean more of them joining up or doing civilian service over a period of years. At first, men aged 26 and over would have to sign up. In haredi society, most men at that age are married with children, which means that the army would pay them substantial salaries. The prime minister says he is ready to foot that bill and to reach his goals gradually rather than provoke a head-on confrontation with the dogged haredim. His proposal, even if it passes in the cabinet, is unlikely to win a majority in Parliament. Yisrael Beitenu, as well as Shas and United Torah Judaism, are all likely to oppose it there. But Mr Netanyahu would be able to argue in court that he is trying to pass more equitable new laws. He will also point out that the army is going ahead with plans to set up more special units for the small but growing number of haredim who are already leaving the yeshivas and enlisting. Several such units already exist, with extra-kosher food and not a woman soldier in sight. This voluntary enrolment reflects a realisation among some haredim that the situation is untenable. A few haredi rabbis are quietly encouraging young men to enlist and then to go on to higher education or vocational training."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2012/01/21/odd-but-useful-allies,"IT IS almost the love that dare not speak its name. Ever since Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, relations between the Jewish state and a Shia Muslim one have grown and flourished. Both fear Iran; both have things the other wants. In a 2009 American diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, Ilham Aliev, the Azeri president, was quoted as saying that the relationship was like an iceberg: nine-tenths of it was “below the surface”. What is known is that Israel gets a good third of its oil from Azerbaijan, via a pipeline that ends at Ceyhan in Turkey, whence it is shipped to Israel. An Azeri drilling company is hoping to strike big in Israeli waters just off the southern port of Ashkelon. Azerbaijan, now a member of the UN Security Council, generally votes with Arab and Muslim countries when it comes to resolutions on Israel. Israelis say they mind more about what Azerbaijan does than what it says. In the past decade Azeri-Israeli trade has grown fast. But the figures do not spell out the size of one-off sales of Israeli military stuff, which make the statistics bounce around. In 2008 Azerbaijan's recorded exports to Israel (almost all oil) were officially worth $3.6 billion; in 2009 they were $1.2 billion; in 2010, $1.7 billion. The lower figures are unlikely to record the full extent of the trade. One of Azerbaijan's largest mobile-telephone providers is a joint venture with an Israeli company. Now Israelis are coming in ever greater numbers to invest, some from industries such as defence. In March Israelis and Azeris, in a joint venture, began to produce drones. Azerbaijan's leaders fear Islamist influence from Iran, where a quarter of the people are ethnic Azeris, whereas Iran's ayatollahs fear the influence of secular Azerbaijan. Iran has scolded Mr Aliev for his cosiness with Israel. Azeri officials are loth to discuss reports that Israel is helping train Azerbaijan's forces. Turkey, which is close to Azerbaijan, also resents Mr Aliev's warmth to Israel. But when Turkey's envoy to Baku, the Azeri capital, urged Azerbaijan's government to follow the Turkish lead in breaking relations with Israel, he got short shrift."

https://www.economist.com/news//2013/03/07/21566358-how-iran-will-respond-threat-attack-moving-red-line,"Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, told the UN general assembly in September that Iran would be able to build a nuclear bomb by the summer of 2013. That’s where he dramatically drew Israel’s bold red line for military intervention. Yet Israel will not strike Iran in 2013. For that it would need America’s help. And America will want to play for time. The war to watch out for in 2013 will not be a military one. Instead, sabotage through cyber-warfare (remember the Stuxnet computer virus) and assassination (four Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed since 2010) will continue, in an effort to delay Iran’s nuclear programme. Suffocating international sanctions now amount to an economic war. Oil production, Iran’s main source of income, is expected to have dropped by 1m barrels a day in 2012 compared with 2011, and the value of the rial, Iran’s currency, has plummeted. Imports of basic goods, including food and medicine, have more than halved in the past year. America hopes these wars of attrition will force Iran to blink first—and agree to suspend uranium enrichment, allow inspection of all its sites and swallow its nuclear pride into the bargain. That will not happen. The Islamic republic under Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader who has the final say over Iran’s nuclear programme, is suffering from a crisis of confidence at home. Caving in to American pressure would seriously damage his regime’s credibility—unless he climbs down on his own terms, covertly. The presidential election in June 2013 may be his chance. Mr Khamenei has distanced himself from the incendiary (and term-limited) president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, turning him into a scapegoat for the regime’s economic woes. Mr Khamenei may be setting the stage to ensure that one of his favourites is the next president. If Mr Ahmadinejad is pushed out early, Mr Khamenei may even declare a state of emergency. Among those who might get the job are Saeed Jalili, Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator, and Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament. Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an ex-president, is arguing for a government of “national unity”. All three men are far enough removed from Mr Ahmadinejad (they are strong critics of his economic mismanagement) to strike up credible new negotiations with America. If so, the nuclear brinkmanship could be put on hold. Stephanie Studer: international correspondent, The Economist"
https://www.economist.com/prospero/2013/02/18/the-black-diaspora-via-israel,"KEHINDE WILEY, an African-American artist, has gained attention for his vibrant, large-scale paintings that appear to mix urban hip-hop imagery with old-master portraiture. His subjects tend to be young black men in hoodies and jeans, who strike the confident poses of kings and aristocratic dandies against bright and ornate wallpaper-like backdrops. For his World Stage series, Mr Wiley has travelled the globe to paint portraits of black men from the streets of India, China, Brazil, Nigeria and Senegal. The most recent stop on this world tour was Israel, and his portraits of confident black Israeli Arabs and Jews are now on view at San Francisco's Contemporary Jewish Museum until May 27th. Dressed in a black Obama T-shirt, black jeans and black high-top trainers, Mr Wiley describes some of the unique challenges of his Israel paintings. ""How do you have a conversation about Israel without discussing Palestine?"" He asks. ""And who am I to have the conversation I'm trying to have?"" He adds that his role as an outsider makes his job both easier and harder. ""I can allow myself to be destabilised and find new histories."" As with his other World Stage paintings, these feature subjects Mr Wiley found through a method he calls ""street casting"": during his wanders around a new city he meets and talks to people—some strangers, some acquaintances—and invites some to model in his studio. Many of the portraits in this show are of Ethiopian Jews whose families immigrated to Israel in the 1980s and '90s during Israel-sponsored airlifts. Kalkidian Mashasda, an Ethiopian Jewish rapper from Tel Aviv, is in several portraits. ""Mostly I worked with friends of friends,"" Mr Wiley says. ""I wanted to work with males, ages 18 to 35, who in some way were dealing with or challenging the anxiety and narcissism of youth-entertainment culture."" Mr Wiley's subjects are set against elaborate backdrops based on the designs of religious objects, such as Torah ark curtains and Jewish wedding certificates. These patterns were chosen largely for their decorative quality, explains Karen Tsujimoto, the show's curator. Trees, a central metaphor in Jewish culture, feature heavily, as do lions, snakes and birds. Each work, created with help from Mr Wiley's studio assistants in Brooklyn and Beijing, is framed in wood and topped with two carved lions holding two tablets. On portraits of Jews these tablets display the Ten Commandments; for Arabs the text is a Hebrew translation of the phrase made famous by Rodney King, “Can’t we all just get along?” Critics have lauded Mr Wiley for his painstaking rendering of human skin in his portraiture, and his heroic depictions of black men. But some have described his work as misogynistic, campy and gaudy. Openly homosexual, Mr Wiley's paintings are also often seen as homoerotic. ""I always wanted to critique male identity and male beauty, and go against some of the codings we have to lay bare,"" he says. ""My work is a deconstruction of the language of painting, sexuality and class. It's a lot more content than just hip hop."" “The World Stage: Israel” is on view until May 27th at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco"
https://www.economist.com/europe/2013/12/14/erdogan-v-gulen,"THE biggest achievement of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s prime minister, during a decade of rule, has been to get the army out of politics. He did it with the help of the country’s most influential Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen (pictured), who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania but commands a global network of schools, charities and media outlets. Now Mr Erdogan has turned on his former ally in a show of force that is likely to determine his own future as well as that of Turkish politics. Strange though it seems to many, Mr Gulen is perhaps the only force that can halt Mr Erdogan’s drift towards authoritarianism. He is also credited with keeping Turkish Islam moderate. Will Mr Gulen mobilise his flock, thought to be in the millions, against Mr Erdogan and his Islamist-leaning Justice and Development (AK) party in the March municipal elections? If so, will their support be enough to wrest Istanbul, the biggest municipal prize, from AK? And what of Mr Erdogan’s dream of becoming Turkey’s first popularly elected president when the post becomes vacant in August? Opinions differ on the outcome of what Kadri Gursel, a pundit, calls the “ugly divorce”. With the levers of power at his disposal, Mr Erdogan might seem the stronger man. He has vowed to phase out thousands of private crammers that prepare students for university exams. A quarter of the schools, a big source of disciples and revenue, are run by Gulenists. The decision, announced last month, sparked a barrage of rebukes, including one from Mr Gulen, who inveighed against the tyranny of “pharaohs”. Mr Erdogan has begun to weed out thousands of Gulenists thought to be embedded in the security services, government ministries and judiciary and who, in his words, constitute “a parallel state”. They are rumoured to possess evidence of AK-linked corruption, as well as compromising videos of Mr Erdogan’s associates. These “agents” are said to be the source of a steady flow of classified documents to the media, one of them a directive from the national security council with Mr Erdogan’s signature on it which calls for defanging religious groups, including the Gulenists. Prosecutors have begun investigating Mehmet Baransu, the journalist who published the document, on “espionage” charges. Never mind that Mr Baransu was hailed as a hero when he published reams of other sensitive evidence used to convict hundreds of alleged coup-plotting generals and their proxies in the controversial Ergenekon trial. The targeting of Mr Baransu and his newspaper, Taraf, is yet another example of Mr Erdogan’s campaign to muzzle dissident voices. A source of enduring speculation is why Mr Erdogan has chosen this moment to go after the Gulenists. The most likely answer is that Mr Erdogan wanted them to show their hand well before the presidential elections. An increasingly paranoid prime minister is said to believe that a “Gulen-Israel axis” is bent on unseating him. His suspicions were fuelled by Mr Gulen’s very public criticism of Turkey’s rupture with Israel in 2010. It is too early to say which of the leaders will prevail. Mr Gulen made some conciliatory noises in his most recent sermon. The latest opinion polls suggest that AK continues to command around 50% in support. People close to Mr Gulen acknowledge that the movement’s image has suffered and that much soul-searching has ensued. Mr Erdogan, who rarely admits to any wrong-doing, ought to follow suit. Turkey would be a happier and more democratic place."
https://www.economist.com/united-states/2013/11/15/barack-bibi-and-iran,"A CRISIS is brewing in America’s relations with Israel. The American public—though strongly pro-Israel—seems either not to have noticed or not to care much. In the coming days and months America and other world powers must decide whether a credible agreement can be reached to slow or halt Iran’s nuclear programme, in exchange for a lifting of crippling economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic. A final deal is months away at best. Israel has already launched a ferocious, pre-emptive verbal assault—aimed squarely at public opinion in America—after just two days of talks in Geneva about an interim agreement to slow Iran’s nuclear work for a few months, aimed at buying time for negotiations on a larger deal. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has not held back. In a speech to thousands of Jewish-Americans in Jerusalem on November 10th he more or less called the American president and his envoys naive to the point of imperilling Israel’s survival. Mr Netanyahu accused the negotiators in Geneva, including John Kerry, the secretary of state, of proposing “a bad and dangerous deal” that would start to unravel sanctions even as Iran retained its capacity to enrich enough fissile material to menace Israel’s survival. America would be next, once Iran perfected long-range missiles, he warned. “Coming to a theatre near you. Do you want that?” he growled. “Well, do something about it.” Mr Kerry retorted that Barack Obama’s government understands where America’s interests and those of its allies such as Israel lie. He snapped: “We are not blind, and I don’t think we’re stupid.” The ground might seem set for a familiar American political showdown in which Republicans denounce Democrats for coddling America’s enemies while cold-shouldering its allies. Yet, with a few exceptions, this is not happening. Instead some big-name Republicans, including likely contenders for the White House, have dodged invitations to whack the president with the cudgel proffered by Mr Netanyahu. “When guys like me start to shoot off on opinions about this kind of stuff, it’s really ill-advised,” Chris Christie told an interviewer asking about Iran, preferring to discuss his thumping re-election as governor of New Jersey. At the libertarian end of the 2016 Republican field, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was careful to praise Israel during a flag-waving speech to military cadets on November 12th, intended to soothe conservatives who think him flaky on national security. “One thing you can know for sure is, you will never see an Israeli burning the American flag,” Mr Paul enthused, bumper-stickerishly. He did not mention Iran or its nuclear ambitions. One explanation is that Americans are weary of war and even of suggestions that they should fix crises far from home. Iran may give foreign-policy wonks the vapours, but American voters feel they have heard a lot of cry-wolf warnings about weapons of mass destruction in recent years, so they are taking a break from wolf-hunting. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, worries that Mr Obama has a habit of “dealing away America’s leverage”. But Senator Corker concedes that in the days after Mr Kerry’s abortive Geneva talks on Iranian nukes, his office did not receive a single call about Iran from a constituent. In contrast, when a congressional vote on bombing Syria loomed in September, after the Assad regime used chemical weapons, his staff were “inundated” with calls opposing American military action. The intense partisanship of modern politics further complicates any attempt by outsiders to rally American support. It is not that Americans are turning anti-Israeli. A 2013 Gallup poll found 64% of them sympathetic to Israel in its dispute with the Palestinians, matching a previous all-time high. But that headline number conceals important nuances. Republican enthusiasm for Israel tracks events that affect America, with big spikes around the September 11th attacks and both Gulf wars. Democrats are markedly more ambivalent about Israel. Most Jewish-Americans vote Democratic. And they are divided in their views of Israel, too. A recent Pew poll of Jewish-American voters found them sceptical about the Israeli government’s commitment to making peace with the Palestinians (fewer than one in five thinks West Bank settlement-building makes Israel more secure). On many measures, white evangelical Protestants are a more reliably pro-Israel voter bloc (possibly because white evangelicals are twice as likely as American Jews to believe that God gave Israel to the Jews). To those who brood, darkly, about Israel’s influence in American politics, the bogeyman of choice has long been the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a hawkish lobby group. AIPAC’s friends in Congress, notably Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have suggested that new sanctions would strengthen America’s hand with Iran. Congress has the power to approve new Iran sanctions, or even to curb Mr Obama’s ability to waive sanctions now in place. If fresh Iran sanctions were allowed to come to a Senate vote, they would pass easily (the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has passed its own fearsome sanctions but cannot make laws alone). That leaves Democratic leaders of the Senate with a dilemma. They do not wish to embarrass their president. But senators distrust Iran intensely, and are not convinced that Mr Obama will insist on a robust deal, either. AIPAC will need to tread carefully—a core tenet of Israeli diplomacy is maintaining bipartisan support in America. The Iran crisis has sharpened old differences between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Obama. But with the American public wary of foreign entanglements, Congress is a weaker-than-usual ally. In the struggle with Iran, Mr Netanyahu is stuck with Mr Obama. They may disagree profoundly on tactics, but there is little support in America for what Israel’s premier has in mind."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2013/05/04/squeeze-them-out,"IT WAS just another day for the Israeli army on the West Bank. Having parked its jeeps in the hills south of Hebron, a unit of soldiers checked the papers of the Palestinians who lived there, confiscated one or two, and then herded the people and their flocks off a hilltop which a nearby Jewish settlement, called Susiya, has been eyeing with a view to taking it over. “Military zone,” tersely explained an Israeli officer, who had just received a warrant declaring it such. “Off you go.” Taking time out from their Saturday morning prayers, a few settlers looked on approvingly. “Don’t argue,” replied the officer, when a Palestinian shepherd asked why the soldiers were moving Arabs out of the newly acquired military zone but not Jews. “You have a minute to move or I’ll arrest you,” said the officer. “Settlers are just off-duty soldiers,” mumbled the shepherd to his sons as they stubbornly continued to tend their sheep. A Palestinian mother picnicking with her two toddlers is hauled away by Israeli soldiers, while villagers plead for her release. The signs of previous bouts of displacement ring the adjacent hills. Mobile homes for young Jewish settlers sprout on the hilltops. Armed with a list of military orders, Israeli soldiers are herding the West Bank’s Palestinians out of the rural 60% of the territory, officially known as Area C, where Israel has full military and civilian control, and into cities. On some days the Israeli army declares a patch of land to be a live-fire military zone. On other days they say the Palestinians must move because of an impending archaeological dig. The erection of hilltop stations to provide antennae for Israeli mobile phones (but not for Palestinian ones) is another oft-cited reason for pushing Palestinians out. Eight Palestinian hamlets around Susiya face demolition.Armed Jewish settlers assist the clearance. Soon after the army did its job, a Jewish shepherdess from Susiya brought her flock onto a Palestinian field of wheat to let it graze. Someone had scratched out all the Arabic road signs. “The only weapons we have are our cameras,” says Alia Nawaja, a mother of seven turned amateur camerawoman, who lives in a nearby hamlet. Palestinian violence, however, still occasionally erupts. On April 30th a Jewish settler was killed by a Palestinian for the first time since September 2011, at the other end of the West Bank. A barrage of reports by the UN, the European Union and assorted charities has repeatedly warned that the Palestinians in Area C are under threat. Some 350,000 Jewish settlers now inhabit over 200 settlements and outposts in the same area, usually on the high ground, twice as many people as the Palestinians in the land below. Moshe Yaalon, Israel’s new defence minister, the ultimate authority in the West Bank, backs a report commissioned last year by the Israeli government, endorsing all such Jewish settlements. Naftali Bennett, another powerful minister in the new coalition of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, wants all of Area C to be annexed outright to Israel. In many respects this has already largely taken place. A senior Israeli officer recently testified in court that in the past 45 years of Israeli occupation the army has redistributed around 70% of the West Bank land designated as state-owned either to Jewish settlers or to the World Zionist Organisation, whereas less than 1% of supposedly state-owned land was granted to Palestinians. While Israel’s government expands Jewish settlements and ties them to Israel proper with a network of roads, it bars and sometimes reverses Palestinian development. It habitually denies housing permits to Palestinians, thus stunting the community’s natural growth, yet provides uninterrupted water to Jewish settlements. Water for the Palestinians generally comes once a week, by lorry. Israeli soldiers have destroyed scores of small EU-funded projects, ranging from wells to solar panelling, and threatened to demolish scores more. So far this year Israel's army has evicted almost 400 Palestinian West Bankers from their homes in Area C, the fastest rate for two years, says the UN, and has dismantled over 200 residential and work-related structures. The number of such incidents has risen sharply since a new Israeli government, with even stronger settler influence within it, took office in March. As a result, the European Union called on April 26th for an end to what it calls “the forced transfer” of Palestinians out of Area C. The Israeli army has also again demolished a restaurant, al-Maghrour, in a rural spot that was popular with Palestinians from nearby Bethlehem, which is increasingly hemmed in by settlements. In addition, some 2,300 Bedouin have recently been earmarked for removal from the strategic west-east corridor known as E1, which links Jerusalem to a big Jewish settlement, Maale Adumim, and to its smaller satellite community, Kfar Adumim, where Israel’s new housing minister, Uri Ariel, happens to reside. CORRECTION: The first version of this story had an incorrect number of Palestinian West Bankers in the final paragraph. THis was changed on May 20th."
https://www.economist.com/europe/2013/03/16/vladimir-putin-and-the-holy-land,"RECENTLY Vladimir Putin took officials to Moscow’s lavish new Jewish museum for a meeting on inter-ethnic relations. After a kosher breakfast and a short tour with Hasidic rabbis, he enthused that even Israel did not have anything on this scale. Mr Putin, the first Russian leader to visit Israel (twice), could hardly have shown more enthusiasm for the Jewish state. Yet Russia continues to vote with the Palestinians at the United Nations, to invite Hamas to Moscow, to help Iran with its nuclear programme and to sell missiles to Syria, which then end up in the hands of Lebanon’s Hezbollah. In truth, a degree of disconnect has marked Russia’s relations with Israel ever since its foundation in 1948. Stalin supported and armed Israel, hoping to use it as an ally against Britain and America, yet he still murdered Jewish anti-fascist leaders at home and made anti-Semitism into a state policy. After the six-day war in 1967 Moscow cut diplomatic ties with Israel and in the subsequent war of attrition it not only armed and trained Arab forces but also secretly sent in air-force squadrons. A heavy use of Russian missiles by Syria and Egypt in the Yom Kippur war in 1973 made Israel realise that “Russian equipment could temporarily overwhelm us,” in the words of Efraim Halevy, a former head of Mossad, Israel’s security service. When Mikhail Gorbachev renewed diplomatic ties with Israel in 1991, the Soviet Union was near collapse. But as Russia became assertive under Mr Putin a decade later, a return to the Middle East was only a matter of time, says Tatyana Karasova, an analyst of Russia-Israel relations. The motives were pragmatism and money. Israel’s sympathy for Russia’s war in Chechnya in 1999 made it a natural ally. But demand for Russian arms from its former Arab clients made them an irresistible market. Officially, Moscow maintains its support for Palestinians. Yet on a personal level Mr Putin seems to admire Israel’s ruthlessness in dealing with its enemies and particularly its tough stance when talking to its biggest friend, America, illustrated by recent tension between President Barack Obama and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. Alexander Shumilin of the Institute of USA and Canada, a think-tank, says Russia’s duality reveals a lack of a clear strategy, an aversion to complexities and a preference for ad-hoc decisions. Mr Putin’s feelings for Israel were enhanced by his passionate interest in the Holy Land. Israel obliged him when it agreed in 2008 to transfer back to Russia an area in Jerusalem called the Sergei courtyard, part of the Russian compound that had belonged to Moscow patriarchy and was sold in 1964 for a load of oranges. The Israelis also halted military supplies to Georgia after the 2008 war. In turn, the Kremlin promised not to sell an S-300 air-defence system directly to Iran. Zvi Magen, a former Israeli ambassador to Moscow, says that since Mr Putin returned as Russia’s president last year bilateral relations have been better than ever. One reason was Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s Soviet-born former foreign minister (now on trial in Israel on charges of breach of trust). Three days after the rigged Duma election in late 2011, Mr Lieberman was the first foreign politician to congratulate Mr Putin on his party’s victory, saying that his observers had spotted no violations. Mr Lieberman always had a strong following among the influential Russian diaspora in Israel. Mr Putin’s freedom from anti-Semitism—ingrained in many of his former KGB colleagues—also won him favours with Jewish leaders in Russia. Yet Maksim Shevchenko, an anti-Israel commentator, argues that Russia’s relations with Israel must not jeopardise its support for the anti-American coalition that includes Iran and Syria. He describes the civil war in Syria as a proxy conflict between NATO and Saudi Arabia on one side and Russia and Iran on the other. Despite some attempts by Russian diplomats to make contact with the Syrian opposition, defending Bashar Assad’s regime remains a priority for the Kremlin—not least as part of its anti-Americanism at home. Speaking to military and civilian officials led by Mr Putin last month, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, confirmed plans for a permanent military naval flotilla in the Mediterranean to “protect Russian national interests”. Pavel Felgenhauer, a Russian military analyst, says that it is also likely that Syria will get an S-300 air-defence system against possible air strikes. Russian officials argue that keeping Mr Assad in office is good for Israel. His fall would almost certainly result in the rise of Islamic fundamentalists in Syria. Mr Shevchenko concludes: “It does not hurt having a good relationship with Israel, even if its creation was Stalin’s big mistake.” Israelis could be forgiven for finding Mr Shevchenko’s generosity rather unsettling."
https://www.economist.com/business/2014/12/11/the-scale-up-nation,"ISRAEL is rightly proud of its status as a startup nation. It boasts the world’s highest concentration of high-tech startups per head. Almost 1,000 new firms are launched every year. But all this entrepreneurial activity is not creating enough jobs as the population grows: the share of people employed in the high-tech sector has declined from 10.7% of the workforce in 2006-08 to 8.9% in 2013. Startups also fail to solve another problem: the country’s high retail prices, which are 20% higher for basic products than in other rich countries, according to the OECD, a think-tank. It doesn’t come as a surprise then that Israelis have become less interested in the super-abundance of startups and more in the scarcity of big successful companies. The startup nation not only has too few of them, it also has the wrong sort. The big firms that dominate the country’s stock exchange are the opposite of startups: not laser-focused organisations, but lumbering business groups that could not compete outside Israel. Worse, Israel’s startups rarely turn into big companies. Only one Israeli firm ranks in the world’s 500 largest companies by market cap, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. This dismal performance, some Israelis explain, is the result of theirs being a small country surrounded by hostile powers. But other small countries are much better at producing successful multinationals (though they are admittedly blessed with friendlier neighbours). Denmark, for instance, has a smaller population than Israel (5.6m versus 8.3m) but three companies in the top 500. Sweden (9.7m) has nine. And Switzerland (8.2m) has 17. For a better explanation, start with Israel’s business statistics. It has one of the world’s most concentrated corporate sectors: 24 major conglomerates control nearly a quarter of the country’s 596 listed companies and more than two-thirds of the total market capitalisation of those firms. These groups have various vices, including high debt, poor focus and pyramid-style ownership structures that allow a handful of people at the top to control a large number of subordinate companies. Predictably, growth of their earnings per share has been dismal: 2% on average in the case of companies listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Israel’s economy was founded by a combination of socialist politicians, who believed in keeping the commanding heights of the economy in state hands, and pioneering business families, who went into lots of loosely related businesses. In the 1990s, as the socialist dream finally faded, the government privatised many of the state-owned companies. But in tackling the first problem it reinforced the second: privatisation proved to be a bonanza for family-owned conglomerates and some newcomers, such as Lev Leviev, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, who had amassed his wealth in the diamond trade and took over one of the largest state-owned construction companies. This would be less of a problem if Israel did not also have a disappointing record in turning startups into viable companies. Venture capital goes mostly to young startups: 80% of funds in Israel compared with 52% in America. Most entrepreneurs cash in at the earliest moment, rather than raising their brainchildren to adulthood. Israeli startups rarely go public, according to the Milken Institute, a think-tank: in 2002-12 only 9% of exits were IPOs (rather than being bought by a bigger firm). And those IPOs had an average size of just $32m. In America the respective numbers were 20% and $237m. These early exits amount to selling the seeds before the tomatoes are ripe. It is also contributing to Israel’s sense of vulnerability: the habit of exiting early is reinforcing fears about inequality which already once, in 2011, exploded into huge demonstrations. Ordinary Israelis worry that young entrepreneurs are more interested in making fortunes than creating jobs—and hence are just as bad as the conglomerates, which are more skilful at extracting rents than providing services. The country has started to tackle both sets of problems. In December 2013 its parliament passed the Business Concentration Act. To promote competition, it limits the use of pyramid structures and prohibits cross-holdings between financial and other firms. Although the legislation gave business groups years to comply, it has political heft behind it: the vote in the Knesset was unanimous. The law is likely to reshape Israel’s economy profoundly, forcing big firms to focus on core businesses and creating opportunities for market entrants. As for startups, a wide range of new policies is being discussed: reforming the stock exchange, in particular easing the listing requirements for startups and high-growth companies; introducing new types of visas to make it easier for foreigners to live in Israel; and ensuring that the new sovereign-wealth fund, which is being created on the back of royalties from the new natural gasfield off the Israeli coast, provides capital to high-growth startups. As politicians are thinking about how to make life easier for them, entrepreneurs are starting to be more patient. Waze, a car-navigation service, for instance, waited a few years before it sold itself to Google in 2013 for $966m. Wix, which helps people create websites, turned down several acquisition offers and went public, again in 2013. And in 2014 Mobileye, which makes software that helps drivers avoid car accidents, raised $890m, a record for an Israeli company going public in America. It is tempting to dismiss the talk of a “scale-up nation” as yet more hype. But the reforms and the recent exits show that one should not underestimate the country’s capacity for patience, one of its hidden secrets, in business as in much else. The Israelis laboriously laid the foundations of the high-tech boom by pouring money into elite universities and creating a clever system to attract venture capital. They will be equally painstaking at ensuring that the land of Davids can produce its share of Goliaths."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/07/15/how-israels-iron-dome-works,"ISRAEL has long been protected by its famed “iron walls”. Now those walls have a rooftop. Israel’s arms manufacturers have devised an anti-missile system, offering what they call an “Iron Dome” overhead. Iron Dome’s manufacturers claim it is the fastest and most reliable such system to date, able to shoot down missiles with a launch-to-impact time of 15 seconds. The $1-billion programme, subsidised by the United States, has served Israel well in Operation Protective Edge, its recent campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Palestinian militants have lobbed almost 1,000 missiles into Israel, but Iron Dome's interceptors have struck down 87% of their targets, according to the Israelis, allowing life in Israel’s cities to proceed more or less normally. How does it work? Iron Dome is the short-range component of Israel’s three-tier anti-missile defences. The other two elements are David’s Sling, still under development, which is intended to shoot down targets in the atmosphere, including over the Mediterranean; and the Arrow system, designed to intercept longer-range ballistic missiles in space. As soon as enemy rockets are launched, Iron Dome’s radar tracks their trajectory, calculates their impact point and launches a missile which within seconds locks onto the rocket and shoots it down. Each interception costs about $60,000, but its architects claim to have saved Israel billions in physical damage and economic impact, as well as loss of life. The system has overcome many teething problems. Initially, Israel’s defence planners were wary of deploying it over airports, lest it respond to aircraft and target them too. Commanders have since developed a country-wide network identifying all friendly airborne traffic, ensuring the Iron Dome's missiles target only the unknown. Other problems remain: even when rockets are successfully shot down, potentially lethal shrapnel falls from the sky. “Whatever goes up, must come down,” says Uzi Rubin, a designer of the Arrow system. And the country’s highways and rural areas remain exposed. Farmers, often migrant workers from Thailand, cower among their crops. Israel’s 200,000 Bedouin, many of whom live in shanty towns, have nowhere to hide. Labourers expanding Israel’s infrastructure look to the sky and pray. On July 14th a rocket seriously injured a ten-year-old girl in her shack in the shanty town of Lakiya. Even over cities, one in ten incoming projectiles slips through. Some wonder if Iron Dome's main problem is in fact a political one. The system's success means that Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has been able to use Iron Dome to maintain his policy of conflict management, with less fear of retaliation. “Iron Dome has altered the calculus of Israel’s political echelons in ways they have yet to understand,” says a former senior official. “It allows Israel to resist internal public and military pressure for a quick end to the conflict, and keep bombing Gaza.” It also provides some degree of immunity against other neighbours armed with missiles, such as the Lebanese Shias' Hizbullah militia, or Syria, perhaps making the agreement of a lasting peace settlement seem less urgent. Nonetheless, as air-raid sirens sound, most Israelis are glad to have the protection of the Iron Dome.

https://www.economist.com/special-report/2014/01/16/all-together-now,"BLOCK 71 HAS long been slated for demolition. A look at the tenant list for the seven-storey industrial building on Singapore’s Ayer Rajah Crescent helps explain why it is still standing: nearly 100 startups live there officially and perhaps as many again informally. Their often strange monikers are interspersed with the more conventional names of venture-capital firms, accelerators and the like. It is the world’s most tightly packed entrepreneurial ecosystem, and a perfect place to study the lengths to which a government can go to support startup colonies. “They essentially force-fed entrepreneurship to the young generation,” says Bowei Gai, a Chinese-American entrepreneur who is working on a “World Startup Report” after visiting nearly three dozen ecosystems around the world, starting in New Delhi in January last year and ending in Singapore in September (see map). The term “ecosystem” for economic clusters was popularised 20 years ago by James Moore, then a business consultant and now a human-rights advocate, who was fond of ecological metaphors. These days the emphasis is less on “eco” than on “system”. For some experts, such as Daniel Isenberg of Babson College, entrepreneurial ecosystems are made up of “domains”, including markets, policy and culture. Others describe them as collections of actors that play certain roles, such as providing talent, finance and infrastructure. Yet others talk about them as a set of “resources” entrepreneurs can draw on. In some ways, ecosystems can be seen as exploded corporations. Finance departments have been replaced by venture-capital funds, legal ones by law firms, research by universities, communications by PR agencies, and so on. All are nodes in a loose-knit support network for startups that does what in-house product-development teams used to do. Silicon Valley is the original entrepreneurial ecosystem, but in recent years such communities have popped up all over the world. They often form in places where young people want to live: Berlin, Boulder, London. Perhaps the most unexpected one is Amman’s; despite the political turmoil in the region and a civil war in Syria next door, Jordan’s capital has a few hundred startups. Israel boasts the largest number of startups per person. Singapore’s companies are not known for being particularly open, but Block 71 has its own ethos. Vinod Nair of Catapult Ventures, which operates price-comparison websites for financial products, talks freely about problems with government paperwork and immigration rules. Dixon Chan of Burpple, a photo-sharing service for food, admits that his parents were not happy when he started his company. And Ray Wu, a manager at the Joyful Frog Digital Incubator, is remarkably helpful in guiding visitors through Singapore’s startup scene. Perhaps it comes from reading “Startup Communities” by Brad Feld, co-founder of the TechStars accelerator network. The book is a to-do list for “building an entrepreneurial ecosystem in your city”, as the subtitle puts it. Mr Feld describes startup communities as self-governing bodies of craftsmen akin to medieval guilds. The first point of his “Boulder Thesis” (named after the city in Colorado where he lives) is that entrepreneurs must lead. A second is that a startup community must be open to anyone who wants to join. But the main message is that you must “give before you get”. For an individual, giving before getting is good business. In a fast-moving and uncertain industry he may need someone’s help some day. “It’s about building social capital,” says Hussein Kanji of Hoxton Ventures, a London venture-capital fund. More important, though, business in ecosystems is not a zero-sum game. Tom Eisenmann of Harvard Business School explains that startup colonies are platforms with strong network effects, a bit like Windows and Facebook: the more members they have and the more activity they generate, the more attractive they become. This helps explain some of these ecosystems’ other characteristics: their tolerance of failure, the endless succession of startup-related talks, meetings, parties and, above all, the constant hype. But what really gets those network effects going is “exits”—a sale to a bigger company or a listing on a stock exchange. Newly enriched founders often become investors themselves and employees start their own companies. Silicon Valley spawned a succession of “clans” emerging from companies such as Fairchild Semiconductor, Netscape and PayPal. Government policy can make a big difference. Even in Silicon Valley, defence dollars during the second world war and the cold war primed the pump before venture capital took over. Nor would Singapore have much of an ecosystem to boast of without the benefit of government support. It is not that Singaporeans are unusually afraid of failure. In a study by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, only 43% of respondents in the city-state said it would put them off starting a business, only slightly more than in Israel and fewer than in Germany (49%). But entrepreneurs in Singapore do not enjoy a particularly high social status. Families prefer their offspring to get a safe job with one of the many multinational companies or, even better, with the government. Investors, too, have generally preferred to put their money abroad rather than into local internet startups. After the collapse of the dotcom bubble in 2000 only a few of the venture-capital firms based in Singapore continued to invest there. And those who did lacked experience, explains Wong Poh Kam, the director of the entrepreneurship centre at the National University of Singapore (NUS), who helped set up many of the city-state’s startup programmes, including Block 71. It may seem surprising that Singapore’s government cares so much about startups, since the country has enjoyed plenty of foreign direct investment (FDI). But officials such as Low Teck Seng, the chief executive of the city-state’s National Research Foundation (NRF), admit that Singapore can no longer just rely on multinational companies and needs to do more to encourage entrepreneurship. To speed up this shift, it has taken every conceivable step to make life easier for entrepreneurs. Registering a company now takes hours rather than weeks. Every year the NUS sends 120-150 students on a one-year internship to Silicon Valley and other ecosystems, and many of them go on to become founders. Back home, entrepreneurs are offered matching grants of up to S$50,000 ($40,000) and a place in an incubator to get their startup off the ground. Investors get an even better deal, allowing them to take all the benefits of a venture yet protecting them against much of the risk—a model successfully pioneered by Israel. The NRF generously tops up investments by accredited incubators: for every S$1 they put in, the agency adds S$5, up to a maximum of S$500,000. Investors also have the right to buy back the government stake at the original price plus a modest interest charge within three years. The results have been impressive. Mr Gai estimates that the city-state now has about 800 internet firms, or 160 for every million inhabitants, which puts it ahead of countries such as the Netherlands and Spain. It has also presided over a few successful exits, notably Viki, a popular video-streaming site which in September was bought for $200m by Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce giant. Yet these numbers do not quite tell the full story. Most successful startups in Singapore are still run by foreigners. Razmig Hovaghimian, Viki’s founder, is an Egyptian-American, and never received any government help. And most of the firms that have raised money from the accredited incubators have yet to find any follow-on funding. Moreover, it is not clear what will happen once Singapore’s government scales back its financial support, which eventually it must if it does not want to subsidise the ecosystem permanently. Some investors are already complaining about plans for a cut in the NRF’s initial investment in information-technology startups to about half its previous level. Medical-equipment and other non-IT firms will get more money. Singapore’s government could spoil the party in other ways, too. A new media law requires certain websites to register, increasing the risk for investors. And new labour regulations make it harder for firms based in the city-state to bring in workers from abroad, exacerbating the scarcity of skilled developers. This is not to say that Singapore’s ecosystem will fall apart. In fact, the city-state’s efficient bureaucracy has a record of learning from mistakes and proving naysayers wrong. Teo Ser Luck, the minister of state in charge of such matters, is in regular touch with entrepreneurs and investors, and the government recently decided to give over another building near Block 71 to startups. But ecosystems are more fragile than their leaders’ confident manner suggests. Network effects can easily go the other way. And governments have to tread carefully because national ecosystems increasingly form part of larger global organisms. Founders and investors, already used to entrepreneurial globetrotting, will readily consider moving to another place if it seems to have more to offer. Often that place is America. With its huge market and vast pool of venture capital, it is still the destination of choice for founders the world over, even though the country’s restrictive immigration policy since September 11th 2001 has made it more difficult for them to settle there. If Asia and Europe do not watch out, their best startups could still end up in Silicon Valley or in one of America’s newer ecosystems, such as Austin, Boulder or New York."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/02/07/a-campaign-that-is-gathering-weight,"ONCE derided as the scheming of crackpots, the campaign for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel, widely known as BDS, is turning mainstream. That, at any rate, is the fear of a growing number of Israelis. Some European pension funds have withdrawn investments; some large corporations have cancelled contracts; and the American secretary of state, John Kerry, rarely misses a chance to warn Israel that efforts to “delegitimise” and boycott it will increase if its government spurns his efforts to conclude a two-state settlement of its conflict with the Palestinians. Israel, says Yair Lapid, Israel’s finance minister, is approaching the same “tipping point” where South Africa found itself in opposition to the rest of the world in the dying days of apartheid. “Let’s not kid ourselves,” he told a conference of security boffins recently in Tel Aviv. “The world listens to us less and less.” BDS has begun to grab the attention of some of the world’s largest financial institutions. PGGM, a big Dutch pension fund, has liquidated its holdings in five Israeli banks (though the Netherlands’ largest has affirmed its investments). Norway’s finance ministry has announced that it is excluding Africa Israel Investments and its subsidiary, Danya Cebus, a big building firm, from a government pension fund. The campaign is drawing support from beyond northern Europe. Romania has forbidden its citizens from working for companies in the West Bank. More churches are backing BDS. An American academic association is boycotting Israeli lecturers. The debate turned viral after Scarlett Johansson, a Hollywood actor, quit her role as ambassador for Oxfam, a charity based in Britain, in order to keep her advertising contract with SodaStream, an Israeli drinks firm with a plant on the West Bank. Mr Lapid, who favours a two-state solution, reels out figures to show how sanctions could hit every Israeli pocket. “If negotiations with the Palestinians stall or blow up and we enter the reality of a European boycott, even a very partial one,” he warned, 10,000 Israelis would “immediately” lose their jobs. Trade with the European Union, a third of Israel’s total, would slump—he calculates—by $5.7 billion. Anxious to hold on to their markets, Israel’s businessmen are increasingly backing the peace camp. The names on a recent advertising campaign in its favour included such luminaries as the head of Google in Israel. Hitherto they had usually preferred to stay out of politics. Israel’s government is divided over how to react to the BDS campaign. The finance ministry has temporarily shelved a report it said it would publish on the possible consequences of BDS. But Israel’s press and ministerial addresses are increasingly full of worried references to it. Some Israelis argue that this publicity merely feeds the BDS campaign, others that isolation has benefits. Israel’s position as a hotbed of hi-tech start-ups is due in part to decades of circumventing Arab boycotts. A French arms ban in the 1960s sparked the development of its weapons industry, helping to catapult Israel into fourth place in the world’s league of arms exporters. And if the West turns its back on Israel, there is, they say, the east. Relations with India have warmed of late, and those with China are getting closer. The economy minister, Naftali Bennett, a sceptic of the peace process, recently toured the Far East, saying he was bringing a “light to the gentiles” by way of Israeli business. But Mr Bennett is in a minority on BDS: his colleagues are a lot less sanguine. Correction: In the original version of this story we referred to Yair Lapid as Israel's foreign minister, when in fact he is the finance minister. Sorry"
https://www.economist.com/international/2017/06/08/how-israel-spots-lone-wolf-attackers,"HIS last Facebook post was perhaps the only clue of Raed Jaradat’s yearning for vengeance: it showed a Palestinian teenager lying dead with her headscarf soaked in blood and the message “Imagine if this were your sister.” Dania Irsheid, 17, had been shot by Israeli security forces in October 2015 at the entrance to the Ibrahimi mosque (Jews call it the Cave of the Patriarchs) in Hebron. Police said she had tried to stab Israelis; Palestinian witnesses say she was unarmed. The next day Raed, a 22-year-old accounting student from the town of Sair, near Hebron, went to a checkpoint nearby and stabbed an Israeli soldier in the neck before he, too, was shot dead. Later his 19-year-old cousin, Iyad, was killed during stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops. Raed and Dania had never met but, at his funeral, their fathers said their children should be married “in Paradise”. Such is the rhythm of the Palestinian “stabbing intifada”. Since its outbreak in late 2015, there have been hundreds of knife and car-ramming attacks against Israelis. If the violence has ebbed, it may be in part because the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have become better at forestalling attacks. Israeli spooks reckon they have lessons to offer Western countries struggling to stop lone wolves. One is that conventional intelligence organisations, even Israel’s well-honed system, are designed to penetrate organised terrorist groups, so they struggle to spot imminent attacks by self-radicalised individuals or small groups. After reviewing the profiles of scores of attackers, IDF intelligence officers found they often acted on the spur of the moment. They were rarely linked to militant factions, and were not especially religious or poor. Many had a grievance: a son who felt unjustly treated, a brother who was disinherited, a bride who was beaten by her husband, and so on. Sometimes they were teenagers bullied at school who wanted to be admired as “martyrs”—Clark Kent becomes Superman, as one officer put it. Often they were so inept that they appeared to be trying to commit “suicide by IDF”. And, as with teenage suicides, there was a pattern of copycat attacks, or at least a tendency of those close to a “martyr” to seek revenge. In Sair, for instance, 13 people have died since 2015 in attacks on, or confrontations with, Israelis. These days IDF algorithms monitor the social-media accounts of young Palestinians to look for early-warning signs. These include “tripwire” terms such as the “sword of Allah” or “day of the sword”, associated with the writings of past attackers. The IDF also monitors the activity of relatives, friends, classmates and co-workers of recent “martyrs”. The parents of those deemed suspicious might receive a telephone call or a visit from the Shin Bet security service, and their names could be passed on to the Palestinian Authority. Their phones are tracked to see if they meet other suspects, or leave their districts to move towards potential Israeli targets. In such cases, security forces detain the suspect. How much of this could be applied in the West? Perhaps not much. Israel holds millions of Palestinians under occupation. Its security barriers restrict their movement and keep them segregated. The army can seal off restive areas, enforce curfews and impose punishments, such as the demolition of homes. In contrast, most Muslims in the West move and mix freely as full citizens. Israeli-style ethnic profiling and ubiquitous electronic surveillance would be neither possible nor desirable. Still, cleverly fusing clues from social media with other information might help, as could early intervention to steer suspects away from possible violence. That means keeping would-be attackers online, where they can be watched."
https://www.economist.com/business/2015/07/30/cyber-boom-or-cyber-bubble,"ISRAEL’S arms exports fell last year. Cutbacks in the defence budgets of many Western countries pushed the global sales of Israeli weapons systems down to $5.7 billion, $1 billion less than in 2013. Unexpectedly, another security-related industry took up the slack. For the first time, the country sold more cyber-wares than arms. According to figures published recently by the cyber-task-force in the prime minister’s office, in 2014 Israeli companies sold around $6 billion of internet-security software, equivalent to about a tenth of the entire worldwide sales of such stuff. A big chunk of that came from Check Point, best known for its ZoneAlarm antivirus software for home computers, and a provider of a broad range of online-security products for business. Its revenues last year were $1.5 billion. But Israel is also producing lots of cyber-security startups. Last year eight of them were sold to foreign investors, for a total of $700m. In September CyberArk, which specialises in protecting firms against attackers who pose as system administrators and other insiders, had one of the year’s biggest IPOs on the American NASDAQ market, and its current valuation is around $2 billion. The number of Israeli cyber-security companies has doubled over the past five years to 300. Demand for their products has boomed, as businesses and governments everywhere have come to realise—often the hard way—that they need to protect themselves against hacking. And Israel has a good supply of experienced software engineers. They come mainly from two sources: first, employees of the 280 high-tech development centres in Israel owned by foreign multinationals, who have begun to strike out on their own; and second, the hundreds of people with suitable skills who leave the Israel Defence Forces each year. The forces have for decades been developing their capabilities—both defensive and offensive—in cyber-warfare, and this policy is now paying a civilian dividend. The many serious hacking incidents of recent years have shown that computer systems can be infiltrated through all sorts of channels, for instance through mobile devices, or by breaking into databases hosted by a third party in the online “cloud”. Earlier software was able to detect known strains of computer viruses, but the rapid evolution of malware has, among other things, given rise to companies offering software that predicts where hackers may next attack and provides defences against them. Some of Israel’s cyber-security startups have established themselves as market leaders. Nevertheless, a few Israeli entrepreneurs worry that the cyber-startup boom may be turning into a bubble. “Every kid who leaves Unit 8200 [the Israeli forces’ electronic-intelligence operation] thinks he’s going to be a cyber-millionaire, and then some of the startups are immediately evaluated at $5m without having done anything,” grumbles an Israeli venture capitalist. “There is a bit of a bubble vibe” to what is happening, says Yigal Erlich, one of the pioneers of Israel’s venture-capital scene. “There could be a limit to this cyber-market. But on the other hand, for Israeli technology this is a perfect niche-market in which local companies can become world leaders.” Gadi Tirosh, the managing partner of JVP, a venture-capital fund based in Jerusalem and chairman of CyberArk, says that over the past two years his fund has examined nearly 300 startup projects in the cyber field but does not believe there is a bubble. “What we are seeing is an overnight evolution, which happened when the chief security officers of corporations around the world suddenly realised how vulnerable they are, and that the cyber-attack can come from anywhere, including from within…That fear is only growing, and in the cyber-industry, that fear means money.” To tap into the reservoir of technically experienced yet often financially naïve software engineers looking to enter the industry, JVP has set up a campus in the southern city of Beer Sheva, which serves as an incubator for startups. The Israeli firms’ main competitors are, unsurprisingly, mostly based in Silicon Valley, where the startup culture, and all the financing and advice that goes with it, is far stronger and longer-established. But the boss of one Israeli firm argues that it and its peers have a big advantage over their American counterparts: the “Edward Snowden factor”. Since the former contractor to the US National Security Agency revealed how much American technology firms were co-operating with the agency, including putting “backdoors” in their software to allow surveillance, clients around the world are looking for “non-American security” for their data, the Israeli entrepreneur claims. Notwithstanding the very close relationship between American and Israeli intelligence, and the links that many Israeli cyber-security entrepreneurs have with their country’s armed forces, the cyber-boss reckons that in many cases, “Israel is their only alternative.”"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2015/05/02/netanyahu-v-the-supreme-court,"ISRAEL’S Supreme Court has long been a solid pillar of the Jewish state’s democracy, holding to account governments of all political stripes. But as the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, puts the finishing touches to his fourth coalition after an election in March, he is preparing for an unprecedented fight to muzzle the court. The outcome of the contest—between politicians and judges, and between nationalist and universal values—could tear his government apart, and determine the future character of Israeli politics. A new coalition is likely to be agreed on in the next few days. Five of its six parties are committed to vote for new legislation that would fulfil the long-held aspiration of right-wing and religious parties to limit the Supreme Court’s power to strike down laws passed by the Knesset. Mr Netanyahu favours an “override clause”, under which the court could overturn laws only if eight or more judges vote to do so (currently a simple majority of the bench, for big cases usually 11 judges from a total of 15, is needed). Even then the Knesset would be able to push the law through with another vote. He also plans to expand the judicial appointments committee, which chooses all of Israel’s judges. By adding a minister and an additional Knesset member to the existing nine-strong committee, politicians would gain the upper hand; the legal profession currently has a majority, with three Supreme Court justices and two members of the bar association. The change could open the way for the government to pack the court. Just how interventionist the Israeli Supreme Court has been is open to debate. Some civil-rights groups think it is too timid, especially on security-related issues. In a landmark decision in 1992, the court opposed the mass expulsion of 415 Hamas members to Lebanon; but after a 14-hour pause it allowed the government to proceed. Two weeks ago, in another decision that angered the left, the court upheld a law that allows cases to be brought against Israelis who call for any form of boycott against Israel and its settlements in the West Bank. The court, however, struck down a clause allowing compensation to be awarded without proof of damage. But such rulings in favour of the government and security forces have not endeared the court to the right. Likud and its allies were incensed by two rulings in recent years that struck down laws allowing the authorities to hold African migrants in long-term detention without trial. The ultra-Orthodox parties see the court as a secular enemy, because of its rulings on issues of state and religion—including a judgment that yeshiva students should not be exempt from serving in the army. The biggest obstacle before Mr Netanyahu is the second-largest partner in his proposed coalition, the centrist Kulanu Party, which opposes his changes. Without Kulanu’s ten members, the prime minister has only 57 votes, four short of a majority. In discussions this week Mr Netanyahu made it clear that he was resolved to pursue his campaign. One option is to keep up the pressure on Kulanu’s leader, Moshe Kahlon, the intended finance minister, to accept judicial changes in return for greater freedom to reform the economy. Ironically, Likud was historically the party of both Jewish nationalism and deep respect for the judiciary. Its first leader, Menachem Begin, was admiringly (though mistakenly) quoted by followers as accepting an unfavourable ruling with the words “there are judges in Jerusalem!” Today Likud is run by a leader who has sworn to break the power of the “old elites” and whose colleagues see the Supreme Court judges as remnants of a privileged left-wing establishment which disregards Jewish values in favour of secular and universal principles. The struggle to limit the powers of the Supreme Court is part of a broader contest over the nature of Israel—pitting religious and nationalist activists against advocates of a more liberal and secular-minded country. There are a few survivors of the old Likud spirit. One is Mr Netanyahu’s rival, President Reuven Rivlin. On April 29th Mr Rivlin made a rare political intervention by criticising the new proposals, saying “we have to ensure a strong democracy.” The Supreme Court’s president, Miriam Naor, also departed from protocol, declaring that “the court is the last barrier preventing harm to human dignity and other basic rights. It is one of the reasons Israel is seen as a member of the family of democratic nations.” What she might have added is that, with Israel facing potential indictments for war crimes at the International Criminal Court, it can ill afford to tarnish the image of its Supreme Court."
https://www.economist.com/europe/2015/01/29/a-very-special-relationship,"YAKOV HADAS-HANDELSMAN, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, was a little boy when Germany and Israel opened diplomatic relations 50 years ago. He remembers the first German ambassador being greeted with howls of outrage and rotten tomatoes. The “past is always there and should always be there,” he says. But today it connects the countries: “Generally, Germany is Israel’s closest ally in Europe.” European leaders marked the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz this week. They might have also pondered new polls. One, by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a think-tank named after the chancellor who negotiated with Israel’s David Ben-Gurion, found that 70% of Israelis see Germany positively. That makes Germany their favourite country in Europe, as thousands of Israelis in Berlin would agree. But a poll by the Bertelsmann Foundation, another think-tank, found Germans more sceptical toward Israel, mainly because of its treatment of Palestinians: 36% have a positive opinion, but 48% are critical. Among young adults, it is more than half. More striking is the difference in how Germans and Israelis view the Holocaust. Bertelsmann found that 81% of Germans want to “leave it behind” and 58% want to “draw a line” under it. The vast majority of Israelis see this as impossible. Germans and Israelis have drawn different lessons from the Holocaust, says Stephan Vopel of Bertelsmann. The Israeli one is never to be a victim again; the German is never to make war again. This contrast feeds other attitudes: 82% of Israelis, for example, want Germany to sell Israel more weapons, whereas 68% of Germans are against. Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, grew up in East Germany, where Nazi crimes against communists were emphasised more than those against the Jews. But at least since her first visit to Israel in 1991, when she was 36 and minister for women and youth, she has seen the Holocaust as central to the relationship. Speaking to the Knesset in 2008, she said the existence of the Jewish state was part of Germany’s raison d’état and non-negotiable. She is hugely popular in Israel. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, goes out of his way to call her a friend of Israel. Yet tensions are growing. Mrs Merkel has lost faith that Mr Netanyahu is honest about wanting a two-state solution. She worries about expanding Jewish settlements on Palestinian land. Standing next to Mr Netanyahu when he visited Berlin two years ago, she said “we agree not to agree” on this. Both governments say such honesty proves the depth of the friendship. Mrs Merkel is careful with her rhetoric to avoid giving fodder to anti-Semitism, whether by Muslims or Christians, which she sees, along with Islamist terror, as one of “the two great evils of our time”. Some 100,000 Jews now call Germany home (most are Russian immigrants). But Germany also has 4m Muslims. In some cities, it is Muslims who are increasingly anti-Semitic. In Dresden, ordinary Germans have been protesting against “Islamisation” of their fatherland. For Germany, living up to the exhortations of the past is becoming ever trickier, since it demands a special responsibility toward Jews and an embrace of minorities. As the Middle East comes to more streets in Germany, it will test the country, and its ties with Israel."
https://www.economist.com/letters/2015/09/10/letters-to-the-editor,"In response to your article on Palestinian hunger strikers, “To feed or to free” (August 22nd), it should be pointed out that around two dozen of Israel’s leading bioethicists, doctors and legal experts have issued a position paper favouring the imposition of life-saving feeding on hunger-striking prisoners when there is a clear threat to their life. They declared that in Israeli culture the value of human life should take priority over that of autonomy. This position, in opposition to that of the Israeli Medical Association, is supported by several Israeli court decisions, by the Israeli Patients Rights Law and is in keeping with the position of the European Court of Human Rights. SHIMON GLICKProfessor, emeritus activeFaculty of health sciencesBen-Gurion University of the NegevBeer Sheva, Israel Bagehot (September 5th) believes that Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn “misreads (or worse, does not like) modern Britain and its instincts”. Britain is described as a country of “rampant consumerism” where “the route to happiness is through personal fulfilment”. How could Mr Corbyn fault a nation that is, according to Bagehot’s sources, increasingly sceptical of organised religion (preferring disorganised, I suppose), of the welfare state (deploring the practice of giving succour to the least fortunate) and of government in general (following the lead of the Tea Party brain trust)? Sarcasm aside, we can only hope that it is Bagehot who is misreading his compatriots. It is disheartening to think that this mindset has become dominant in a people who opened the way for democracy, led the fight against African slavery, recognised early the rights of workers and women and instituted one of the world’s first systems of universal health care. LELA STROMENGERLexington, Kentucky It is worth bearing in mind that although spending on different marketing media has changed fundamentally (“A brand new game”, August 29th), advertisers are not so much choosing one medium over another as working out how each of us consumes, and responds to, different combinations of media. Some people first notice a product on social media, then research it further online, then buy it in store. Some are inspired by what is offered through direct mail and buy through e-commerce. Our research over the past ten years finds that stereotypical preconceptions are on the wane. Older people are doing as much online, if not more, as the young. Younger people are more responsive to all media than cynical older buyers. PAUL LINDSELLManaging directorMindMetre ResearchLondon Many agree with the aim of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting project to reduce the scope for canny tax managers who avoid their tax liability by finding discrepancies between national corporate-tax codes (“Patently problematic”, August 29th). But others fear that it is arbitrary and distortionary to insist that tax competition must operate on headline rates or thresholds. Not only are rates falling inexorably as globalisation intensifies competition for capital, but taxing profits also creates a harmful debt bias, which can only be fixed by inelegant, problematic allowances for corporate equity, and is among the most economically damaging of taxes. A government which recognised the fundamental flaw in using profits as a base, and replaced it with a tax on distributions, could reap substantial tax-simplification and economic-efficiency benefits. RORY MEAKINTaxPayers’ AllianceLondon * One critical way to expedite EU integration of the Balkans (“Knocking on Heavens Door”, August 29th) is to start by building an integrated energy system compliant with EU environmental standards and regulations. The proposed coal-fired power plant in Kosovo remains a prime example of a project that could set back EU accession by decades. Relying on lignite coal for electricity production in the region is not sustainable for the environment or public health. Linking electricity markets to take advantage of load balancing through hydropower projects in Albania and by creating a regional low-carbon roadmap will require significant cooperation—leadership traits that go hand-in-hand with joining the EU. As the region expects to retire coal capacity in the coming decade, an opportunity emerges for a new energy system to jumpstart the lagging economy and enable a sustainable transition to the EU. However, new proposed coal plants in Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo conflict with that vision. With Montenegro and Serbia expected to accede by 2020 and 2022, respectively, environmental and health considerations should become a priority to avoid further costs. Building a sustainable energy system is essential for economic growth in the Balkan region. DANIEL KAMMENProfessor and Director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory NOAH KITTNERUniversity of California, Berkeley “A bigger, better Suez Canal” (August 8th) lauded the economic benefits of the expansion of the canal, but there was no mention of the environmental effect on the Mediterranean Sea. Marine scientists agree that the canal’s enlargement will increase invasions of species from the Red Sea, resulting in a range of harmful effects on the ecosystem structure and functioning, with real implications for humans. Some 450 such species have already been recorded in the Mediterranean, many of which are noxious, venomous or ecologically ruinous and pose clear threats to human health, tourism, fisheries and littoral installations. For example, swarms of venomous jellyfish clogging bathing beaches, fishing nets and intake pipes at power plants. The better canal of your headline augurs ill for the Mediterranean Sea. BELLA GALILMarine biologistNational Institute of OceanographyHaifa, Israel There is a big structural explanation for why so many British children leave school early in addition to the factors you outlined (“Hiding in plain sight”, August 22nd). This is the fact that kids “graduate” at 16 with their GCSE exams and often need to change school to continue until 18 with their A-level exams. This gives many pupils a systemically mandated decision point at which they can opt out of education. Were high school to be a consolidated progression, such as in America and Australia, students would naturally move on to the next grade with a lower chance of leaving. SIMON GOLDMANCambridge, Cambridgeshire Reading your report on the decentralised control system and brainpower of certain cephalopods, especially the octopus (“Tentacles that think”, August 15th), brought to mind an outside-the-box analysis of what we can learn from nature about protecting ourselves from terrorist threats, natural disaster and pandemics. In “Learning from the Octopus” the late Rafe Sagarin, a marine ecologist and security analyst at the University of Arizona, developed these ideas in a provocative work documenting the way that certain natural species have survived in a world of predators, adversaries and surprise attacks.

https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/11/27/the-status-of-arabic-speakers-in-israel,"THE Israeli parliament is a rowdy place at the best of times. Last month things got especially tense. Betzalel Smotrich, a right-wing lawmaker, caused uproar when he dismissed Arab Israelis as “illiterate”. Mr Smotrich was quickly condemned by other MPs as an “ignoramus”. Though they may not be fluent in Hebrew, all Arab Israelis grow up speaking Arabic. But if Mr Smotrich’s intervention was especially crude, his outlook is not unique. Arabic has long been marginalised by Israeli society. Why? Following the 1948 war, several hundred thousand Palestinian Arabs found themselves in the State of Israel. The arrival of nearly a million Mizrahi Jews, from Arab countries, also grew the Arabic-speaking population. Arabic became an official language of the Israeli state. Today Arabic is the native tongue of a fifth of the population. Most Arabic-natives can also speak Hebrew. Switching between the two is not too hard: both Arabic and Hebrew are Semitic languages with many common features. Yet until 2002, Arabic was rarely found in official settings. New laws widened its use, but Israelis still downplay its importance. In 2014 MPs tried to retract Arabic’s special status.  This tension is rooted in the centrality of Hebrew to the Zionist project. Before the 1880s, no one had spoken Hebrew colloquially for two thousand years. Zionists thought resurrecting Hebrew was a way of fostering a shared identity among Jews from different backgrounds. Hebrew was therefore aggressively promoted by the young Israeli state. Languages traditionally spoken by Jews, like Arabic and Yiddish, were discouraged. Arabic songs were seldom heard on Israeli radio. Even now, more money is budgeted for Hebrew schools than Arabic ones. And when Arabic is found, it is often misused. For Arabs, Jerusalem is known as “Al Quds”, or the Holy Sanctuary. But Israeli road signs transliterate Jerusalem directly from Hebrew as “Yerushalayim”. Acknowledging the religious importance of Jerusalem to Muslims is awkward given Zionist claims over the whole city.  All this has led to claims that the government wants to sweep away the region’s rich Arab heritage. At any rate, it makes Arabic speakers reluctant to integrate into Israeli society. Fully 70% think they are treated as second-class citizens, even though they speak Hebrew every day. Such feelings bleed into political life. For instance, Arab Israeli MPs refused to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres, a former president. The distrust cuts both ways. A recent poll showed that nearly half of Israeli Jews supported the expulsion of all Arabic speakers from the country. Still, there are a few positive signs. This year, an Arabic film was picked as the Israeli entry for the Oscars. All Israeli children now have to learn some Arabic. Indeed, some Israeli Jews are rediscovering their Arabic roots. A-WA, a popular band made up of Yemeni Jews, have released several hits in Arabic. But it will be a while yet before changing attitudes filter upwards. Correction (November 29th): A previous version of this explainer asserted that Arabic songs were banned from Israeli radio. While there was no official ban, some radio stations did not play Arabic music. The text has been updated. "
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2016/05/13/hizbullahs-military-commander-is-killed,"EARLY on May 13th Hizbullah, the Lebanese Shia armed movement which, together with its sponsor Iran, has been propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad since early in the Syrian war, announced the death of its senior military commander in Damascus. Details were sketchy: Mustafa Badreddine, sent to lead Hizbullah’s contingent in Syria in 2012, had been killed in a “major explosion”. He was by no means the only officer Hizbullah has lost in Syria over the last few years, but he is certainly the most high-ranking. The secretive Mr Badreddine is reported to have replaced the organisation’s operations chief, Imad Mughniyeh, after his assassination in Damascus in 2008. The severe blow this represents to Hizbullah, which is both a political party and a disciplined military outfit, was reflected in the disarray within its usually well-disciplined media machine. While one of Hizbullah’s television channels was quick to blame Israel for the killing, the organisation’s official spokesmen refused to specify any potential perpetrators. Neither were the timing and location of the explosion clear, with conflicting reports that it had taken place near the border with Lebanon or on the outskirts of Damascus, on the night of May 10th or possibly May 12th. Although most explosions in war-torn Syria are filmed and the footage quickly put online, there were no images available of this one. Israel is the usual suspect for any mysterious assassinations in the region. And it would have had a clear motivation for eliminating Mr Badreddine, who, together with his mentor Mughniyeh, had directed much of Hizbullah’s operations against Israel over the past three decades. But the list of both regional and international players who will rejoice at the news of his death is long. Mr Badreddine is believed to have been involved in a string of attacks throughout the Middle East, not only on Hizbullah’s own account, but at the bidding of the movement’s patrons in Syria and Iran. He was arrested in the early 1980s in Kuwait and sentenced to death for planning to blow up the American and French embassies there. He was saved by the Iraqi invasion in 1990; the occupiers released him from prison and let him return to Lebanon. He was later indicted by an international tribunal investigating the assassination of Lebanon’s prime minister, Rafik Hariri, in 2005. Since knocking out a secret nuclear reactor in 2007, Israel has employed a strict policy of silence about its operations in Syria, neither confirming nor denying any of the air strikes attributed to it. Over the past five years, though, it is believed to have carried out around 20 attacks, usually on arms convoys destined for Hizbullah in Lebanon. In January 2015 an airstrike on the Golan killed Jihad Mughniyeh, the operations chief’s son, who was leading Hizbullah’s operations in the area, as well as an Iranian general and other commanders. Last December Samir Kuntar, a Lebanese terrorist who had been in an Israeli prison for 29 years and was reckoned to be planning cross-border attacks together with Hizbullah and Iran, was killed in an airstrike on a Damascus suburb. Israeli officials have repeatedly said that the country is not taking sides in the Syrian conflict, but that it will act to prevent Hizbullah from building strongholds on its borders or accumulating advanced missiles. In a rare admission the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said during a visit to the Golan in April, that “we act when we need to act, including here across the border, with dozens of strikes meant to prevent Hizbullah from obtaining game-changing weaponry.” On May 13th the Israeli government stuck to its usual policy of neither acknowledging nor denying involvement in attacks in Syria. Uncharacteristically, though, military sources discreetly briefed journalists that this time it wasn’t an Israeli job. Hizbullah’s reluctance to blame Israel is also a deviation from previous assassinations. As for the Syrian rebel groups fighting the coalition of Hizbullah, Iran and Shia militias that supports the Assad regime, none has claimed responsibility either. At this point no possibility can be ruled out, including internal Shia rivalries or an accidental explosion. But whatever the cause, Mr Badreddine’s death is a blow to Hizbullah, which has lost over 1,400 of its fighters in Syria, including many of its most experienced commanders. Losses on this scale are becoming a serious problem for Hizbullah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. But until its paymaster, Iran, decides that Mr Assad is no longer worth propping up, Hizbullah’s losses, and Syria’s agonies, are likely to continue."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2016/12/24/moving-the-us-embassy-to-jerusalem,"A PINE grove in south Jerusalem has remained untouched for decades. This is the site reserved for America’s embassy in Israel (pictured). But like every other country that recognises the Jewish state, America has its embassy in Tel Aviv rather than the holy city. Donald Trump may change that. He was not the first American presidential candidate to promise to move the embassy to Jerusalem in line with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which was passed by Congress in 1995. But every president since has signed a national-security waiver suspending the act, arguing that Jerusalem’s status will be determined only after a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Although Israel has considered Jerusalem to be its capital since December 1949, most other countries cling to the UN resolution from 1947 that divided Palestine to create the Jewish state. It said that Jerusalem should remain a corpus separatum, or separate entity belonging to no country. Mr Trump’s representatives have, however, said that he intends to move the embassy. Last week he named David Friedman as ambassador to Israel. A bankruptcy lawyer, Mr Friedman is an outspoken supporter of the Israeli far right, has donated money to Jewish settlements in occupied territories and says that members of J Street, a liberal Jewish organisation, are “far worse than Kapos” referring to Jewish collaborators in Nazi concentration camps. On October 27th Mr Friedman told a gathering in Jerusalem that the State Department “has been anti-Semitic and anti-Israel for the past 70 years”. If its staff were to oppose moving the embassy, they would be fired by Mr Trump, he said. The prospect of the embassy’s move has been greeted with jubilation by members of Binyamin Netanyahu’s cabinet and by dire warnings from the Palestinians. Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian Authority official, said it would “destroy the peace process” and launch the region on a “path of chaos”. Yet it may also revive moribund talks. “Trump has already shown he is prepared to shake things up,” says a veteran Israeli diplomat. “Maybe moving the embassy could actually be shock therapy to the peace process and bring the sides back to the table.”"
https://www.economist.com/business/2016/07/09/talent-search,"ISRAEL’S high-tech sector seems to be a land of milk and honey. Scarcely a month passes without another announcement of a foreign tech giant buying a local firm. In 2015 Israeli startups raised a record $4.4 billion in venture capital, up by 30% from the previous year. Yet the country once christened the “startup nation” is losing steam. Between 1998 and 2012 the tech industry grew on average by 9% annually, more than double the rate of Israel’s GDP. In all but one of the past six years, the tech sector has expanded at a slower rate than the overall economy. The main cause for the slowdown is a growing shortage of trained workers, according to a recent report by the chief economist of the ministry of finance. This may come as a surprise, given the country’s reputation for having a deep pool of tech talent, mainly because of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), which rely heavily on technology and churn out thousands of highly skilled workers. But a complex mix of social, educational and business factors is increasingly constraining the size of Israel’s tech workforce. There is a limit to the size of any industry a small country of only 8m people can sustain. Until recently, the tech industry was helped by two trends: academics and employees of state-owned industries moving into the private sector and the arrival of tens of thousands of Jewish engineers emigrating from the former Soviet Union. Both these sources of fresh talent have now dried up, even as others remain obstructed. Two growing parts of the Israeli population are underrepresented in the job market: Israeli Arabs and the ultra-Orthodox, who together make up around 25% of the population. Israel’s universities are producing fewer engineers, too: the share of graduates with science degrees is down from 12% in 1998 to 9% in 2014. At the same time, demand for skilled tech workers continues to grow, and not just in the private sector. The IDF need to keep their trained operatives longer, for instance to expand their cyber-warfare capabilities. Competition for such personnel is fierce: many are snapped up by firms offering twice the pay the army does. Moreover, the Israeli tech industry doesn’t make the best use of the talent available. Many workers want to start their own firm, rather than toiling at a big one, meaning that most firms are tiny with only a handful of employees. Israeli entrepreneurs also tend to seek swift “exits” and quickly sell their startup to foreign companies. As a result, the country’s tech firms are not creating training schemes, points out Yigal Erlich of Yozma, the outfit that seeded many Israeli venture-capital funds. The government has started to take action. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and a former high-tech entrepreneur himself, has launched an emergency plan to boost the number of students studying mathematics. For the first time in Israeli history, government economists are considering long-term work visas for foreign engineers. The IDF, for their part, have streamlined their training courses and now provide soldiers with the option of online distance-learning, so they can enhance their skills on the job. “But there is a limit to what we can do. Conscription is down due to demographic reasons and few of the new conscripts arrive with basic tech skills,” says Danny Bren, a former commander of the IDF’s Lotem Unit, the main provider of computer and networking services for the army. Israel may have to take still more radical steps. One could be to provide more Israeli Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews with the skills necessary to work in the tech industry. Another potential source of talent are the more than 4m Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, over 50,000 of whom are already allowed to work in Israel, but mainly on building sites and other low-paid jobs. Before Israel imports engineers from Asia, it should consider its closest neighbours."
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/12/19/what-is-populism,"DONALD TRUMP, the populist American president-elect, wants to deport undocumented immigrants. Podemos, the populist Spanish party, wants to give immigrants voting rights. Geert Wilders, the populist Dutch politician, wants to eliminate hate-speech laws. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the populist Polish politician, pushed for a law making it illegal to use the phrase “Polish death camps”. Evo Morales, Bolivia’s populist president, has expanded indigenous farmers’ rights to grow coca. Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines’ populist president, has ordered his police to execute suspected drug dealers. Populists may be militarists, pacifists, admirers of Che Guevara or of Ayn Rand; they may be tree-hugging pipeline opponents or drill-baby-drill climate-change deniers. What makes them all “populists”, and does the word actually mean anything? Widespread use of the term “populism” dates to the 1890s, when America’s Populist movement pitted rural populations and the Democratic Party against the more urban Republicans. (It was also used to refer to Russia’s 19th-century narodnichestvo movement, which largely comprised self-hating intellectuals with a crush on the peasantry.) In the 1950s academics and journalists began applying it more broadly to describe everything from fascist and communist movements in Europe to America’s anti-communist McCarthyites and Argentina’s Peronistas. As Benjamin Moffitt explains in his book “The Global Rise of Populism”, a conference at the London School of Economics in 1967 agreed that the term, while useful, was too mushy to be tied down to a single description. Some scholars linked it to frustration over declines in status or welfare, some to nationalist nostalgia. Others saw it as more of a political strategy in which a charismatic leader appeals to the masses while sweeping aside institutions (though not all populist movements have such a leader). Despite its fuzziness, the term’s use has grown. In 2004 Cas Mudde, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, offered a definition that has become increasingly influential. In his view populism is a “thin ideology”, one that merely sets up a framework: that of a pure people versus a corrupt elite. (He contrasts it with pluralism, which accepts the legitimacy of many different groups.) This thin ideology can be attached to all sorts of “thick” ideologies with more moving parts, such as socialism, nationalism, anti-imperialism or racism, in order to explain the world and justify specific agendas. Poland’s Mr Kaczynski, a religious-nationalist populist, pushes for a Catholic takeover of his country’s institutions from elite secular liberals. The Dutch Mr Wilders, a secular-nationalist populist, demands a crackdown on Islam (in defence of gay rights) and reviles the multicultural elite. Spain’s Podemos, an anarchist-socialist populist party, pushes to seize vacant buildings owned by banks and distribute them to the poor, and attacks “la casta” (the elite caste). This “thin ideology” definition of populism seems apt in Britain, where Brexiteers denounce experts, refer to themselves as “the people” and boast of having “smashed the elite”. Indeed, Brexit seems to lack a unified “thick ideology”: Brexiteers have different attitudes to trade, race, government spending and almost everything else. But other scholars feel that the thin-ideology definition fails to capture some dimensions. Jan-Werner Müller, a political scientist at Princeton University, thinks populists are defined by their claim that they alone represent the people, and that all others are illegitimate. And there are important distinctions within the category, such as that between inclusive and exclusive varieties. Exclusive populism focuses on shutting out stigmatised groups (refugees, Roma), and is more common in Europe. Inclusive populism demands that politics be opened up to stigmatised groups (the poor, minorities), and is more common in Latin America. Mr Mudde argues that while most writers deplore populism, its upside lies in forcing elites to discuss issues they prefer to ignore. But populism’s belief that the people are always right is bad news for two elements of liberal democracy: the rights of minorities and the rule of law."

https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/05/18/israels-economy-is-a-study-in-contrasts,"IN A PATCH of desert until recently frequented only by passing camels, workers in a computer lab examine new “smart” appliances: a slow cooker on one bench, a security camera on another, a smoke detector on a third. Millions of devices that incorporate mini-computers are being connected to the internet. But as well as convenience, the “internet of things” offers cyber-criminals many new vulnerabilities to exploit. “If I were an attacker, I would never hide in your PC,” says Oleg Brodt, director of research and development at Cyber@BGU, the cyber-security research centre run by Ben Gurion University in Beersheva. “I would try to hide in your smoke detector or door alarm, because nobody bothers to protect them.” The centre has shown how wearable devices can be used to eavesdrop on corporate networks. It has also demonstrated the multitude of ways in which even supposedly ultra-secure computer systems not connected to the internet can be hacked. These include exploiting FM radio waves emitted by video cards, the blinking of LED lights or even the pattern of heat signatures. The Israeli government wants to turn Beersheva, a comparatively poor southern city, into one of the world’s prime cyber-security centres, attracting multinationals to work with startups in an incubator (established by JVP, an Israeli venture-capital fund) and with the university’s computer-science department. More important, the army’s signals-intelligence Unit 8200 and other tech-savvy branches are due to relocate to Beersheva in the coming years, providing a flow of young and capable veterans to boost the industry. Alumni of Unit 8200 have already seeded much of Israel’s high-tech industry. Israel attracts about 15% of the world’s venture-capital investment in cyber-security. It is part of Israel’s booming “startup-nation” economy, the most dynamic innovation ecosystem outside America. Direct flights now connect San Francisco to Tel Aviv. Other high-tech areas look promising, too, among them agricultural and water technology (building on Israel’s expertise in desert farming), digital health services and financial technology. The biggest buzz is over driverless cars. Boosters think that Israel can help produce their brains—computer vision, lidar (laser scanning), artificial intelligence and cyber-security—leaving the engines and the metal-bashing to others. Intel, a giant maker of computer chips, has recently bought Mobileye, which makes driver-assistance systems, for $15.3bn. All this marks a remarkable change from the 1980s, when Israel was on the brink of financial collapse. Its near-defeat in the Yom Kippur war had caused it to push defence spending to an extraordinary 30% of GDP in 1975. By 1984 public debt had reached nearly 300% of GDP and hyperinflation peaked at 450% a year. In the past decade the economy has grown at about 4% a year. The unemployment rate is 4.3%, a record low. The labour-force participation rate has risen. A country with few natural resources plans to export gas to Europe from its offshore fields, and is selling water to Jordan as water desalination gathers pace. Public debt has come down to 62% of GDP, the current account is in surplus and foreign-currency reserves are high. All significant transactions were once reckoned in dollars; the worry now is the strength of the shekel, which has appreciated by 13% against a basket of currencies in two years. The central bank periodically intervenes in foreign-exchange markets to hammer it down. Israel has not had a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of falling output) since the height of the second intifada. The Israeli economy “is inoculated to a large extent” from wars in Gaza and Lebanon, says Eugene Kandel, a former economic adviser to the government and director of Startup Nation Central, a non-profit group that links global firms with local startups. It is easy to be dazzled by Israel’s high-tech firms. In fact, the country has two separate economies. The dynamic, globalised startup nation accounts for only about a tenth of employment, whereas nine in ten Israelis work in something more akin to a left-behind nation that is inefficient and protected from competition. Poverty rates in Israel are among the highest in the rich world, for two main reasons: the ultra-Orthodox often live on public subsidies to pursue a life of Talmudic studies; and Arab citizens struggle to achieve equality. Mr Kandel talks of the high-tech industry as a Zeppelin floating above the rest of the economy and only loosely connected to it. This raises two fears. One is that the Zeppelin will drift away if the regulatory, political or security environment deteriorates. The other is that it will fail to lift the rest of the economy. The answer, Mr Kandel thinks, is for startups to grow into big firms in their own right, instead of selling up to companies like Google. Even if the buyers leave their R&D centres in Israel, only so many people can become high-end developers. Larger companies would hire more lawyers, accountants and the like. For a country with many highly educated people, Israel scores poorly in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a test of the science, maths and reading skills of 15-year-olds from across the world run by the OECD, a rich-world think-tank. Even after stripping out the dire results of Israeli Arabs, the results of Hebrew-speakers were still mediocre—and would look even worse except that ultra-Orthodox Jews do not take the test. “PISA does not matter to the startup economy,” explains Mr Kandel. “It matters to the rest of the economy. We need solid PISA results to be able to adopt innovation, not necessarily to create innovation.” Naftali Bennett, the education minister, is trying to nudge students into taking more demanding maths courses. He also wants to improve the standard of teacher-training colleges, although strong unions make it hard to align pay with performance, let alone sack bad teachers. He argues that the real secret of Israel’s startup economy is not the educational system but rather the culture of entrepreneurialism, rooted in self-reliance inculcated in young Israelis in the army and youth groups. Dan Ben-David, of Tel Aviv University and the Shoresh Institute, a think-tank, sees things differently: “The IDF is an army, not a school.” He reckons that Israel’s real existential threat is poor productivity, not terrorism or external dangers: “We can’t stay like this for another 30 or 40 years. Sooner or later there will be a crisis.” He divides Israel’s economic development into two distinct periods. One was the era of catch-up growth leading to the Yom Kippur war in 1973, when Israel’s productivity converged with that of the G7 countries; thereafter it diverged again. Israel’s strong growth of recent years, he says, is due mainly to a rise in the number of workers, not in productivity. Israel’s population is growing fast, and cuts to welfare benefits have pushed more people, particularly ultra-Orthodox women, into work. According to Mr Ben-David, Israel has chronically underinvested in education and infrastructure because resources have been spent on subsidies for ultra-Orthodox yeshivas and Jewish settlements. And the split-economy problem is likely to worsen. Ultra-Orthodox Jews (about 7% of the Israeli population) and Arabs (approximately 21%) have higher fertility rates than other groups; together they are projected to make up half of the Israeli population within about 40 years, Without big changes, average participation rates and productivity will drop. By throttling back public spending, Binyamin Netanyahu may have left Israel with too little fiscal leeway to invest in public goods and alleviate poverty. As the country has shed its socialist heritage, government spending has fallen from a hefty 80% of GDP in 1980 to below 40%, low by rich-world standards. Israel also scores poorly on the OECD’s measures of restrictiveness in product markets and services. Oligopolies and monopolies abound, and over the past decade the country’s position in the World Bank’s ease-of-doing-business index has slid from 26th to 52nd. This has meant low wages and high prices. The cost of living is about 20% higher than in Spain and 30% higher than in South Korea. Kosher certification makes food more expensive, and the panoply of quotas, tariffs, regulatory barriers and guaranteed agricultural prices has piled on extra costs. Strikingly, a country that has produced globally popular taxi and navigation apps does not allow Uber to offer its cheap car-for-hire services because of resistance from the taxi lobby. Bottlenecks in construction and land allocation have driven up the price of housing, especially in Tel Aviv. Try to use a mobile-phone app in the West Bank or Gaza and it soon becomes apparent that the Palestinian territories, with 5m people, are in economic oblivion. Palestinian operators have not yet been able to set up 3G services, despite repeated promises; Palestinians with Israeli phones have to get close to settlements to use their services. Navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze offer skimpy information: they cannot find a route between big Palestinian cities—say, Ramallah and Nablus—but offer directions between small Jewish settlements near both. The economic disparities are striking. With GDP per person at $35,700 a year in 2015, Israel’s standard of living is much the same as France’s. For the West Bank the figure stands at $3,700, akin to Egypt’s; for Gaza it is about $1,700, similar to Congo-Brazzaville’s. In real terms, Gazans are about 25% poorer today than they were at the time of the Oslo accords. Israel’s security barrier is, to a large extent, also a one-way protectionist barrier. The Palestinian market is fully exposed to Israeli goods, but Palestinian products struggle to get out. Strawberry farmers in Gaza, working less than a kilometre from the border fence, say they cannot export to Israel and only rarely to the West Bank. In the main, Palestinians are treated as a source of cheap, and disposable, labour. “We have no economic policy. Everything is tied to the political situation,” says Mohammad Shtayyeh, president of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development & Reconstruction, which co-ordinates aid from donors. The Palestinian economy depends on the earnings of workers in Israel and the settlements, customs remittances from Israel and donations from the West and the Arab world. All these are subject to sharp fluctuations over which Palestinians have little control. Palestinian areas, Mr Shtayyeh notes, operate with three foreign currencies: the Israeli shekel, the Jordanian dinar and the American dollar. There is no lack of entrepreneurship among Palestinians. The new city of Rawabi, rising on a hill north of Ramallah, is as ambitious as any government-built Jewish settlement, yet is a private project part-funded with investments from Qatar. It will count 6,000 units, ranging from homes for middle-class Palestinians to holiday flats for Israeli Arabs; and have amenities from classy global clothing chains to an amphitheatre and the Middle East’s longest zipwire. The project has encountered countless impediments, but families have started to move in. Rawabi will include space for Palestinian startups seeking to work with Israeli and global firms. “We don’t have to do a lot to attract them. They are already next door to us,” says Bashar al-Masri, the businessman who conceived the city. Gazing west from Rawabi, the Tel Aviv skyline appears starkly against the gleaming Mediterranean. Few Palestinians can hope to visit it. But there are no checkpoints on fibre-optic cables; against the odds, a startup industry may yet appear in the failing startup state that is Palestine."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/08/19/israel-has-a-gas-conundrum,"LONG a resource-poor country, Israel now has more natural gas than it knows how to use. Even by conservative estimates, the fields discovered off its Mediterranean coast since 2009 hold enough energy to meet domestic needs for 40 years. The government hopes to earn a windfall by selling the excess abroad; the owners of Leviathan, the largest field, have earmarked 9bn cubic meters (bcm) for export each year. Jordan has already signed a deal to buy some. Israel wants to send the rest farther afield—offering it to Europe as an alternative to Russian supplies. But geography and politics make that difficult. An overland pipeline would have to cross either Lebanon or war-torn Syria, neither of which recognises Israel. The shortest underwater path, to Turkey, is also problematic, because it would pass through Cypriot waters. Turkey occupied the northern third of the island in 1974; the Republic of Cyprus, which governs the south and also has gas to sell, rejects the project. So in April Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s energy minister, signed a preliminary agreement to build an undersea pipeline directly to Europe. It would be the world’s longest, following a 2,200km path to Cyprus and onwards to Greece and Italy, at a depth of up to 3km. Mr Steinitz says it would take eight years to finish and cost up to $7bn. Sceptical energy executives think both estimates are low. There may be a better solution next door. On August 8th Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, signed a law that allows private companies to import natural gas. It takes effect later this year. One firm, Dolphinus Holdings, is already in talks to buy up to 3bcm from Leviathan. Egypt is itself poised to become a major gas producer: the Zohr field, discovered off its northern coast in 2015, holds the largest reserves in the Mediterranean and is almost twice the size of Leviathan. But even that gigantic find may not be enough to meet booming demand in a country of around 95m people. Imports from Israel could help fill any gaps—and turn Egypt into a regional energy hub. Unlike Israel, it has two liquefaction terminals, which allow natural gas to be loaded onto tankers and shipped round the world. Both have sat idle for the past five years, since Egypt diverted its exports to the local market. They could soon ramp up again, giving Israel access to European ports. All this would be a reversal of recent history. Egypt used to supply Israel with 40% of its natural gas, under a 20-year deal signed in 2005. It quickly became a source of public anger, because the gas was sold at below-market rates. After the revolution in 2011 a Cairo court convicted the architects of the deal, including Hussein Salem, a business tycoon who fled to Marbella, in Spain, to avoid trial. Prosecutors said the state lost more than $700m in revenues. Independent experts put the figure much higher. Egypt pulled out of the contract in 2012, and a Swiss court eventually ordered Egas, the state-owned monopoly, to pay $1.7bn to compensate its Israeli partners. A new deal could be politically fraught, but it would come at an opportune time. Egyptians are worried chiefly about their struggling economy. By working through private companies, instead of Egas, Egypt could also sidestep any complications from the judgment, which is still unpaid. It would probably import the gas via Jordan, to avoid using a pipeline from Israel that is owned by a plaintiff in the case. Though the Israeli embassy in Cairo is empty, security ties between the two countries are better than ever. Their economic relationship may be in for a big boost, too."
https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/05/18/israel-still-rules-over-palestinians-50-years-after-its-six-day-war,"IN THE BEGINNING they destroyed Egypt’s air force on the ground and knocked out the planes of Jordan, Iraq and Syria. That was Monday. Then they broke Egypt’s massive defences in Sinai. That was Tuesday. Next, they took the old city of Jerusalem and prayed. That was Wednesday. Then they reached the Suez Canal. That was Thursday. They ascended the Golan Heights. That was Friday. Then they took the peaks overlooking the plain of Damascus. In the evening the world declared a ceasefire. That was Saturday. And on the seventh day the soldiers of Israel rested. In just six days of fighting in June 1967, Israel created a new Middle East. So swift and sudden was its victory over the encircling Arab armies that some saw the hand of God. Many had feared another Holocaust. Instead Israel became the greatest power in the region. Naomi Shemer’s anthem, “Jerusalem of Gold”, acquired new lines after the war: “We have returned to the cisterns/To the market and to the market-place/A shofar [ram’s horn] calls out on the Temple Mount in the Old City.” This is a year of big anniversaries in Israel: 120 years since the First Zionist Congress in Basel; 100 years since the Balfour Declaration promised the Jews a national home; and 70 years since the UN proposed to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. But the commemoration of the half-century since the six-day war will be the most intense. This special report will examine the legacy of that conflict. The territories that Israel captured are the defining issue of its politics and its relations with the world; they are also at the heart of Palestinian dreams of independence. The six-day war was the last unalloyed military victory for Israel, and the start of a transition from existential wars against Arab states, which it always won, to enervating campaigns against non-state militias which it could never wipe out. The threat of invasion across its borders has vanished, but the violence within them is unceasing. In 1967 Western arms decisively beat Soviet ones. As America allied itself firmly with Israel, cold-war divisions overlaid the Arab-Israeli conflict. And when Charles de Gaulle switched sides to align France with the Arabs in 1968, in effect banning weapons sales to Israel (notably of Mirage jets), he unwittingly laid the foundation for Israel’s flourishing high-tech industry. These days it is France that buys drones from Israel. The embattled refuge for the Jews became a mini-empire, ruling over millions of Palestinians. It was, in many ways, an improvised conquest, “The Accidental Empire” (the title of a book by Gershom Gorenberg), but one which has endured. The war awakened Palestinian irredentism and Israeli zealotry, and added the intractable power of religion to the forces of nationalism. The wall that divided Jerusalem has gone, but Israel has erected many more barriers that atomise Palestinian society. Israelis have grown rich, which makes the misery of Palestinians all the more disturbing. In uniting the ancient land of Israel, the victory has divided Israel’s people and coarsened its democracy. That heady June day in 1967 when Levi Eshkol, then Israel’s prime minister, heard news of the capture of Jerusalem, he told party colleagues: “We’ve been given a good dowry, but it comes with a bride we don’t like.” His words proved more prescient than he imagined. Old Israeli soldiers still tell their stories of the war day by day, hill by hill. Reuven Gal was a platoon commander in the Jerusalem Brigade, a unit of reservists from the city who fought within earshot of their homes. After a battle to control the UN headquarters the previous day, Mr Gal recalls advancing at dawn on June 7th towards Jordanian trenches on the hill of Jebel Abu Ghneim. To his relief the position had been abandoned. As his men rested, he heard the radio signal from Motta Gur, commander of the paratroopers who had entered the walled city: “Har habayit beyadeinu” (the Temple Mount is in our hands). All around him, hardened soldiers wept at the news. After the war, Israelis loved to hike in the ancient hills, rediscovering Hebron, Eli, Shiloh and more; for Mr Gal, Jews “became drunk” with euphoria at taking the lands of their biblical ancestry. And he thought that after such a defeat the Arabs would have to sue for peace. He breaks into a song from the time: “Tomorrow, when the army take off their uniforms/All this will come tomorrow, if not today/And if not tomorrow, then the next day.” But peace did not come. Every generation of Israelis must still put on the uniform and prepare to fight. Mr Gal became the army’s chief psychologist and later a senior national-security official. “Little did we know what this military victory would bring,” he reflects. “The celebrations were the beginning of the tragedy of the occupation. It has had a tremendous impact on our morality, democracy, the souls of our children and the purity of arms [the morality of the use of force].” Palestinians, for their part, talk of their dismay at how Jordanian troops gave up Jerusalem’s Old City with barely a fight, and of their surprise at discovering that the armoured vehicles rumbling into the city were not Iraqi reinforcements but Israeli. On the edge of the Jewish Quarter of the walled city, Abu Munir al-Mughrabi lives in a small one-bedroom flat that is a makeshift museum to the loss of Arab Jerusalem. On his wall of pictures of the city, one shows him as a 25-year-old in a suit, standing amid the rubble of his neighbourhood, the Mughrabi Quarter. It was demolished by Israel immediately after the capture of the Old City, turning the alleyway in front of the Western Wall, the most important place of Jewish prayer, into the wide plaza it is today. He holds up his hand-drawn map of the vanished buildings and a list of the 138 families that were cleared out. Abu Munir had been in Amman when the war broke out. He slipped back across the border to reach Jerusalem just as his home was being torn down. For a time he smuggled people to and from Jordan. He also smuggled weapons for Fatah, then a rising militant movement, and spent time in jail. His story illustrates a change of mindset by Palestinians. In the war of 1947-48, when Israel was established, Palestinians fled or were pushed out en masse. Hundreds of villages were destroyed. By contrast, in 1967 most stayed on. “We were lucky that we were defeated so fast and so massively,” says Ali Jarbawi, now a professor of political science at Birzeit, a Palestinian university in the West Bank. “Israel did not have time to kick us out.” There were also some unexpected benefits: Palestinians from the West Bank, which had been annexed by Jordan, renewed ties with Palestinians from Haifa and Jaffa, which had been part of Israel after 1948; and from Gaza, which had been occupied by Egypt. “The Palestinian national feeling re-emerged because of the occupation,” says Mr Jarbawi. That sentiment burst forth with the first Palestinian intifada, or “shaking off”, in 1987. Until then the Palestinians under Israeli rule had remained mostly placid, while the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), dedicated to the removal of Israel by force, conducted cross-border attacks from abroad. The armed struggle was, for the most part, a failure. The PLO lost a civil war against King Hussein of Jordan in 1970; embarked on a campaign of international terrorism, including the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics of 1972; helped to precipitate the civil war in Lebanon in 1975; and was evicted to Tunis after Israel’s invasion of 1982. By contrast, the intifada was marked mainly by stone-throwing clashes. It dashed the illusion that Israel could hold on to the occupied territories at little cost. The Oslo accords of 1993 established an autonomous Palestinian Authority under Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, who returned triumphantly in July 1994. Extremists on both sides set out to destroy the deal with unprecedented violence. A Jewish settler killed 29 Palestinians at prayer in Hebron in 1994. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, both Islamist factions, embarked on a campaign of suicide-bombings. In 1995 a right-wing Jew murdered the prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin. The second intifada, precipitated by the failure of peace talks at Camp David in 2000, involved guns and bombs. Mr Arafat often seemed to tolerate, or even encourage, the militants. Unilateral Israeli withdrawals from Lebanon in 2000, and from Gaza in 2005 (after Arafat’s death), did not bring peace either: Israel fought repeated wars against Hamas and Hizbullah (a Lebanese Shia militia), both of which fired numerous rockets at Israel. The decades of the “peace process” brought much process and little peace. For Israelis, land for peace became land for suicide-bombs and rockets. “Most people feel that the occupation is no longer our fault,” says Yossi Klein Halevi of the Shalom Hartman Institute, a think-tank. “I came out of the first intifada as a Labour voter. But the second intifada moved me to the right.” For most Palestinians, the Oslo deal brought a worse occupation: more bloodshed, internal division, loss of land to settlers and territorial fragmentation. Palestinians these days live as refugees in the Arab world; in an open prison in the Gaza Strip run by Hamas; in a patchwork of isolated autonomous enclaves in the West Bank run by the nationalist Fatah faction; as neglected “residents” of Israel in Jerusalem; and as second-class citizens struggling for equality in Israel’s pre-1967 borders. The chaos in the Middle East since the Arab uprisings of 2011 has hardened Israel’s conviction that it is too risky to give up more land: what if Hamas or Islamic State (IS) took over the hills of the West Bank overlooking Israel’s most populated areas? Israel came close to returning the Golan Heights in peace talks with Syria. Now that militias such as Hizbullah, al-Qaeda and IS have implanted themselves on the frontier, many Israelis are grateful that the negotiations failed. For their part, the Palestinian feel their cause has been forsaken by Arabs that once held it dear. Pollsters say that opposition to the idea of peace based on the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel is strongest among the young of both sides, those aged 18-24. Their parents may have known a time with no internal barriers and cordial if unequal relations between Arabs and Jews. These days most young Israelis and Palestinians have little contact. Life in Israel, safe behind the security wall and the mental one that says “there is no partner for peace”, is more comfortable than it has been for most of the country’s short life. Security has improved, for now. The economy is booming. And even as its politics turns more chauvinistic, its society is opening up in other ways. Arab citizens of Israel, who lived under martial law until 1966, are becoming more integrated economically. In Jerusalem, some Jews and Arabs challenge each other at backgammon and dance the Palestinian dabke. Israeli music is rediscovering the rhythms and tones of the Orient. The army welcomes women and gays, despite objections by some rabbis. The old conflicts over sabbath observance are, for the most part, a thing of the past. Even in Jerusalem, islands of secularism have emerged. Visit the beaches or the pulsating bars of Tel Aviv, eating non-kosher Thai prawns, discussing the latest algorithm and watching the handsome youth drift by, and you might imagine yourself in California. Fifty years after 1967, it has become too easy for Israel to forget that, just a short drive away, the grinding occupation of Palestinians has become all but permanent.

https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2017/03/08/why-some-airlines-remove-israel-from-their-online-route-maps,"STARING at an airline’s route map can cause the heart to flutter. It seems to divide the world into two distinct groups, between memories and possibilities. But on some carriers’ maps, a third classification exists: the non-existent.  Many airlines’ route maps show every country in the world, regardless of whether they fly there. Those that do not usually illustrate their network by showing only those cities and countries served by the airline. But a few are more selective still, omitting only a single country from their worldview: Israel. A new paper*, which is currently under peer review, by Joel Waldfogel and Paul Vaaler, both of the University of Minnesota, looks into the phenomenon. The pair classified 111 of the world’s international airlines depending on how they treat Israel on their online route maps. Outside the Middle East, all dealt with it consistently: either Israel was shown as part of a comprehensive map, or it its inclusion was dependent on whether the airline served the country. Not so for those based in the Middle East. Here, many airlines simply erase Israel’s name off otherwise comprehensive maps (this is often done by amending a Google map). Examples of such removers include Qatar Airways, one of the big international “super connectors”, as well as smaller carriers including Saudia and Kuwait Airways (screenshot shown above). Others take a different approach. These, in the words of the paper, show “plausible deniability”. Their maps include a selection of countries, including ones not served by the airline, but not the Jewish state. This, say the professors, allows them to argue that they are not singling out Israel by omitting only it. For example, Israel is one of a number of countries excluded from the route map of another superconnector, Etihad. It does, though, include several others that it also does not fly to, such as Mali, Armenia and Guinea. The carrier says it only highlights countries served either by it or one of its codeshare partners, although Gulliver could find no partner that flies to the aforementioned countries. (The carrier responded that its map needs to be updated. Other than Etihad, none of the airlines contacted replied to requests to explain their position.) Other operators turn the proposition on its head. Egypt Air, for example, does include Israel on its map, but does not let on that it actually flies there. Services from Cairo to Tel Aviv are flown by a specially created subsidiary. Why do airlines choose to tinker with their maps in this way? Many of the carriers in question are majority-owned by the state, and many of those states, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, do not recognise Israel. Some, though, may also be pandering to the preferences of their customers. Although many airlines in the region do not accept passengers with Israeli passports, none explicitly bars Jews. However, the professors devised a weighted index that combines the share of enquiries for airlines from different countries (based on Google searches) and a measure of anti-Semitism in those countries (as gauged by an index produced by the Anti-Defamation League, a civil-rights organisation). They also looked at whether the carriers offer a kosher food option. Kuwait Airlines, for example, lists 17 special meal options on its website, ranging from “bland” to “vegetarian oriental” to “Jain”, but nothing to cater to observant Jews. A correlation emerged between an airline’s removal of Israel from maps, its lack of a kosher food option for passengers, and the likely prevalence of anti-Semitism among its customers. (Again, it should be pointed out that the professors’ methods and conclusions are still being reviewed by peers.) All of which implies that these airlines’ customers may be happy with the status quo. It also suggests there is no great business imperative for Middle Eastern carriers to alter their treatment of Israel. Including Israel on maps may seem an insignificant concession but, argues Mr Vaaler, it would not go unnoticed. Conversations with some of his Arabic law students convinced him that many would find it an affront. What is more, removing the country does not seem to be putting off international partners. Air France, for example, codehares with Saudia. Meanwhile Delta, the world's largest carrier, lists Saudia as one of its codeshare partners on its “professional” site, though not on its customer-facing one. (Delta did not answer a request for clarification.) And despite criticism from Jewish groups, in 2012 Saudia and Middle East Airlines of Lebanon, another Israel-remover, joined Sky Team, the alliance led by Delta.  A map has always had meaning beyond mere cartography. It “does not just chart,” wrote Rief Larsen, “it unlocks and formulates meaning.” For some airlines, that meaning is open to interpretation.  *“Discriminatory Product Differentiation: The Case of Israel’s Omission from Airline Route Maps”, February 2017, Joel Waldfogel and Paul M.

In this grim diagnosis Edward Luce, a Washington-based commentator, argues that the liberal order cannot be fixed without a clear view of what has gone wrong. Refuge: Transforming a Broken Refugee System. By Alexander Betts and Paul Collier. Oxford University Press; 288 pages; $18.95. Allen Lane; £20Lost in the row over Europe’s migration crisis in 2015 were the millions of refugees who stayed in the developing world, unwilling or unable to journey to richer countries. Growing up in a refugee camp often means little education and no work. Two experts at Oxford University present the first comprehensive attempt in years to rethink from first principles a system that has long been hidebound by hand-wringing and old ideas. The Road to Somewhere: The Populist Revolt and the Future of Politics. By David Goodhart.

Jonathan Cape; £16.99Of the 18,500 people who perished in the Japanese tsunami in 2011, 75 were children who died at school. But a single school accounted for 74 of those deaths. This mesmerising account of the 120-foot-high wave and its aftermath, by the Asia editor and Tokyo bureau chief of the Times, explores the uncharacteristicly fierce reaction of the dead children’s parents to official evasion. In the process it tells you more about Japan than any conventional history. The finest work of narrative non-fiction to be published this year. Grant. By Ron Chernow. Penguin Press; 1,104 pages; $40. Head of Zeus; £30The historian who inspired “Hamilton”, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical, argues that America’s most improbable president has been badly misunderstood. Instead of being seen as the overlord of a corrupt administration (though it never touched him personally), he should be lauded for the integration of the union after the civil war and his insistence on naming blacks, Jews and native Americans to federal positions.

Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are. By Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. Dey Street; 288 pages; $27.99. Bloomsbury; £20Big data, says Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, a former data scientist for Google, provides new sources of information. It captures what people actually do or think, rather than what they choose to tell pollsters; it helps researchers home in on and compare demographic or geographical subsets; and it allows for super fast randomised controlled trials.

By Elizabeth Currid- Halkett.

Translated by Jen Calleja. Other Press; 176 pages; $16.95. Fitzcarraldo Editions; £12.99Cigarettes function as punctuation for life, argues Gregor Hens, a German author and translator. They make it coherent and add drama, inserting commas, semi-colons and ellipses (and, in the end, an inarguable and often premature full stop).

https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data,"A NEW commodity spawns a lucrative, fast-growing industry, prompting antitrust regulators to step in to restrain those who control its flow. A century ago, the resource in question was oil. Now similar concerns are being raised by the giants that deal in data, the oil of the digital era. These titans—Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—look unstoppable. They are the five most valuable listed firms in the world. Their profits are surging: they collectively racked up over $25bn in net profit in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon captures half of all dollars spent online in America. Google and Facebook accounted for almost all the revenue growth in digital advertising in America last year. Such dominance has prompted calls for the tech giants to be broken up, as Standard Oil was in the early 20th century. This newspaper has argued against such drastic action in the past. Size alone is not a crime. The giants’ success has benefited consumers. Few want to live without Google’s search engine, Amazon’s one-day delivery or Facebook’s newsfeed. Nor do these firms raise the alarm when standard antitrust tests are applied. Far from gouging consumers, many of their services are free (users pay, in effect, by handing over yet more data). Take account of offline rivals, and their market shares look less worrying. And the emergence of upstarts like Snapchat suggests that new entrants can still make waves. But there is cause for concern. Internet companies’ control of data gives them enormous power. Old ways of thinking about competition, devised in the era of oil, look outdated in what has come to be called the “data economy” (see Briefing). A new approach is needed. What has changed? Smartphones and the internet have made data abundant, ubiquitous and far more valuable. Whether you are going for a run, watching TV or even just sitting in traffic, virtually every activity creates a digital trace—more raw material for the data distilleries. As devices from watches to cars connect to the internet, the volume is increasing: some estimate that a self-driving car will generate 100 gigabytes per second. Meanwhile, artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning extract more value from data. Algorithms can predict when a customer is ready to buy, a jet-engine needs servicing or a person is at risk of a disease. Industrial giants such as GE and Siemens now sell themselves as data firms. This abundance of data changes the nature of competition. Technology giants have always benefited from network effects: the more users Facebook signs up, the more attractive signing up becomes for others. With data there are extra network effects. By collecting more data, a firm has more scope to improve its products, which attracts more users, generating even more data, and so on. The more data Tesla gathers from its self-driving cars, the better it can make them at driving themselves—part of the reason the firm, which sold only 25,000 cars in the first quarter, is now worth more than GM, which sold 2.3m. Vast pools of data can thus act as protective moats. Access to data also protects companies from rivals in another way. The case for being sanguine about competition in the tech industry rests on the potential for incumbents to be blindsided by a startup in a garage or an unexpected technological shift. But both are less likely in the data age. The giants’ surveillance systems span the entire economy: Google can see what people search for, Facebook what they share, Amazon what they buy. They own app stores and operating systems, and rent out computing power to startups. They have a “God’s eye view” of activities in their own markets and beyond. They can see when a new product or service gains traction, allowing them to copy it or simply buy the upstart before it becomes too great a threat. Many think Facebook’s $22bn purchase in 2014 of WhatsApp, a messaging app with fewer than 60 employees, falls into this category of “shoot-out acquisitions” that eliminate potential rivals. By providing barriers to entry and early-warning systems, data can stifle competition. The nature of data makes the antitrust remedies of the past less useful. Breaking up a firm like Google into five Googlets would not stop network effects from reasserting themselves: in time, one of them would become dominant again. A radical rethink is required—and as the outlines of a new approach start to become apparent, two ideas stand out. The first is that antitrust authorities need to move from the industrial era into the 21st century. When considering a merger, for example, they have traditionally used size to determine when to intervene. They now need to take into account the extent of firms’ data assets when assessing the impact of deals. The purchase price could also be a signal that an incumbent is buying a nascent threat. On these measures, Facebook’s willingness to pay so much for WhatsApp, which had no revenue to speak of, would have raised red flags. Trustbusters must also become more data-savvy in their analysis of market dynamics, for example by using simulations to hunt for algorithms colluding over prices or to determine how best to promote competition (see Free exchange). The second principle is to loosen the grip that providers of online services have over data and give more control to those who supply them. More transparency would help: companies could be forced to reveal to consumers what information they hold and how much money they make from it. Governments could encourage the emergence of new services by opening up more of their own data vaults or managing crucial parts of the data economy as public infrastructure, as India does with its digital-identity system, Aadhaar. They could also mandate the sharing of certain kinds of data, with users’ consent—an approach Europe is taking in financial services by requiring banks to make customers’ data accessible to third parties. Rebooting antitrust for the information age will not be easy. It will entail new risks: more data sharing, for instance, could threaten privacy. But if governments don’t want a data economy dominated by a few giants, they will need to act soon."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/10/11/israels-ties-with-china-are-raising-security-concerns,"THE chief of one of Israel’s intelligence agencies was recently surprised to discover that Chinese construction workers on a major building project might be able to see into a sensitive installation. But it is in keeping with a trend. Israeli security officials are growing increasingly uneasy with China’s expanding role in the economy, particularly its involvement in several big infrastructure projects and its purchase of cutting-edge technology. The concern falls into two broad categories. The first is over Chinese control of strategic infrastructure and the possibility of espionage. Officials are reluctant to go on the record, but many point to the new commercial-shipping facility in Haifa as an example of what is at stake. It is run by the Shanghai International Port Group, which won the tender in 2015 and began working on the site in June. Haifa is Israel’s busiest port and the base of its main naval fleets. Israeli submarines, widely reported to be capable of launching nuclear missiles, are docked there. Yet the deal with the Chinese firm was never discussed by the cabinet or the national security council, a situation one minister described as astonishing. The other concern is over the transfer of weapons technology to the Chinese. Gone are the days when Israel would sell them military hardware. After numerous complaints from America, Israel agreed to cut off arms sales to China in 2005. But a grey area has sprung up around dual-use technology, such as artificial intelligence and cyber-security products, which could be used for surveillance and intelligence purposes. This worries Israel and its allies alike. Security officials note that China is the biggest trading partner of Iran, Israel’s mortal enemy. China has helped modernise Iran’s armed forces and sold it civil nuclear technology. The Chinese are always trying to find ways to buy dual-use products, say Israeli businessmen. Security officials fear more of it is making its way to China. Israel’s commercial ties with China have flourished under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who met President Xi Jinping in Beijing last year (see picture). In the first eight months of 2018 Israel sold $3.5bn-worth of goods and services to China, up 63% compared with the same period last year. China accounts for a third of the investment in Israel’s impressive technology sector, said Mr Netanyahu last year. The prime minister will host Wang Qishan, China’s vice-president, for an “innovation summit” in Jerusalem on October 24th. Mr Wang, the most senior Chinese official to visit Israel, will be accompanied by a large delegation of Chinese investors, including Jack Ma, China’s best-known e-commerce tycoon. But Israel’s oversight of its trade with China does not appear to be keeping up with the pace of commerce or technology. Special export licences are needed to sell some dual-use technologies, but there are plenty of loopholes, say Israeli businessmen. In his zeal to improve commercial ties, Mr Netanyahu has dragged his feet on plans to form a government agency that would regulate deals with China—and, he fears, slow down trade. “Israel has to do business with China, of course, but there is no serious mechanism to make sure that we don’t sell off key economic assets and valuable technological knowledge,” says Efraim Halevy, a former head of Mossad, Israel’s foreign-intelligence service. With oversight lacking, Israeli firms are often left to police themselves. “Ultimately Israeli companies want to be able to work both in China and in the West,” says an Israeli businessman with nearly two decades of experience selling high-tech products to the Chinese. “It means we have to regulate ourselves and learn how to say no to the Chinese when they want to buy or invest in some of our products.” Unsurprisingly, security officials are not satisfied with that set-up."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/11/17/an-election-looms-in-israel,"WHEN AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN became Israel’s defence minister in 2016, he vowed to eliminate the leader of Hamas within 48 hours. Two years later Ismail Haniyeh is still alive—and may have just helped eliminate Israel’s government. On November 14th Mr Lieberman (above, left) resigned, withdrawing his party from the ruling coalition over its supposed meekness in the latest flare-up in the Gaza Strip. That leaves the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu (above, right), with a one-seat majority in the Knesset. He may lose that if other right-wing parties follow Mr Lieberman’s example. The general election scheduled for November next year is likely to be brought forward to the spring. A week that began with efforts to bring calm to Gaza has sparked a coalition crisis in Israel. After more than a decade under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade, Gaza seems as intractable as ever. Conditions for its 2m people are dire. Poverty is widespread; infrastructure is crumbling. Since March large crowds have been protesting every week at the border fence. Scores have been killed by Israeli snipers. Flaming kites launched from Gaza have burned thousands of acres of Israeli land. Frequent exchanges of rockets and air strikes threaten to turn into a full-scale war. In the past decade there have been three. Mr Netanyahu has sought a deal to prevent a fourth war. On November 8th Israel let a Qatari envoy into Gaza carrying three suitcases stuffed with $15m in notes. The cash was distributed to civil servants. Many had not been paid since the summer. Israel also allowed lorries laden with diesel oil, also donated by Qatar, to enter the fuel-starved strip, letting its sole power plant restart a second turbine. Gazans now get at least eight hours of electricity a day. That is an improvement, given that they endured barely four hours in the summer. In return for these meagre comforts, Hamas agreed to limit the protests. Many Israelis disliked the deal, seeing it as akin to paying protection money to the militants. But Mr Netanyahu believed he could withstand the criticism. Keeping Gaza out of the headlines would reduce the pressure to make concessions to the Palestinians, which he has spent his career trying to avoid. On November 11th, while visiting Paris for Armistice Day, Mr Netanyahu said the deal would prevent “unnecessary war” and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The calm lasted only a few hours. That evening a squad of Israeli soldiers in civilian clothes, some dressed as women, ran into gunmen from Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules Gaza, during an intelligence mission there. A firefight ensued, with a car chase to the border. The commandos called in air strikes and helicopters to extract them. Seven Palestinian militants and an Israeli officer were killed. Hamas and its allies fired 460 rockets and mortars at Israel; Israel struck 160 buildings in Gaza. Eight more Palestinians were reported killed in Gaza, and one in Israel. Egypt soon brokered a truce. Neither side wanted a war. Mr Netanyahu was bent on the deal, as was Hamas, which hopes better conditions in Gaza will sustain its unpopular rule. But Mr Netanyahu’s allies were furious. They wanted a stronger reaction. In Sderot, a town close to the border with Gaza, hundreds of residents came out in protest, burning tyres. Mr Lieberman claims to have advocated a much tougher line on Gaza, one opposed by Mr Netanyahu and Israel’s generals. Announcing his resignation, he accused his boss of a “surrender to terror”. The truce, he said, would bring short-term quiet at the expense of Israel’s real security. The leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, Naftali Bennett, covets the defence ministry. But the prime minister is loth to elevate one of his chief rivals. Instead Mr Netanyahu will take over the post himself, adding it to his jobs as foreign minister and head of government. As a result, Mr Bennett seems likely to quit the coalition and force an election. Mr Netanyahu had hoped to start the election campaign on his own terms. In July the Knesset passed a law declaring Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people. Though largely symbolic, it alienated Israel’s non-Jewish minorities and drew scorn abroad. But it pleased his base. Last month the prime minister visited Oman, which has no official relations with Israel, and met its sultan. He hoped to campaign as a statesman and staunch nationalist who has brought peace and quiet to southern Israel. Instead he is having to fend off attacks on his security record. But Mr Lieberman will not have an easy time either. As defence minister, he endorsed many of the decisions he now criticises. Mr Bennett has attacked his record for months. All three will compete for the same right-wing vote. Mr Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu party, which draws support from an ageing crop of Russian émigrés, is polling poorly. His attack on Mr Netanyahu’s policy in Gaza, although well timed, feels like a desperate bid for survival. After a decade in power, Mr Netanyahu could soon surpass David Ben-Gurion’s record as Israel’s longest-serving leader. With a divided field and an uninspired opposition, he may still win the next election. But corruption charges have cast a shadow over his administration. His list of challengers is long and growing. For years they avoided attacking him directly, thinking they would lose. But Mr Netanyahu may no longer have that weapon of deterrence."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/05/31/russia-struggles-to-balance-between-israel-and-iran,"AS MISSILES rolled across Red Square during Russia’s Victory Day parade on May 9th, Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, stood squarely beside President Vladimir Putin. He had come to secure Russian support for containing Iran in Syria. Pinned to his lapel was the orange and black St George’s ribbon, a symbol of the second world war that has become synonymous with Russian revanchism in Ukraine. The overtures appear to have worked: as The Economist went to press, Russia and Israel were finalising an agreement that would attempt to keep Iranian forces some 15 miles (24km) away from the Israeli border in Syria. The agreement highlights Mr Putin’s delicate balancing act in the Middle East. Since intervening in Syria’s civil war in late 2015, Russia has positioned itself as the indispensable player, able to speak to nearly all sides. It has maintained contact with Turkey, America and the Arab countries involved in the conflict. Most notably, it has kept good relations with Israel, with which it shares strong cultural and economic ties, as well as Iran, its partner in propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s blood-soaked president. But as the war begins to wind down in Syria, Russia may feel that it needs Iran less. In the past it looked the other way when Israel bombed convoys in Syria carrying weapons to Hizbullah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese militia that fought a bloody war with Israel in 2006. Some think Russia is now going further. As Iran tries to establish permanent bases in Syria, Israel has attacked its positions. The night of the parade in Moscow, Israel launched dozens of air strikes on Iranian forces, unimpeded by Russian air defences in Syria. Some Iranians suspect that Mr Putin provided Mr Netanyahu with the co-ordinates of Iranian bases. Whether an agreement between Israel and Russia over the deployment of Iranian troops can be enforced remains to be seen. “Russia has limited levers of influence,” says Nikolai Kozhanov, a former Russian diplomat in Iran and professor at the European University in St Petersburg. “Much depends on the desires of Iran itself.” While Mr Putin has called for foreign forces to leave when the war is over, Iran’s foreign legion, the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which some countries classify as a terrorist group, seems bent on staying. The interests of Russia and Israel, on the other hand, appear to be converging. “We have a good understanding with Russia and we can prevent another political crisis in Syria,” says a senior Israeli official. “As far as we’re concerned Assad will continue to rule.” That is bad news for rebel groups in the Syrian villages near the border, which Israel had assisted with food, medical supplies and the occasional shipment of light arms. Rebel commanders say they have already seen soldiers from Iranian-backed militias pulling back. An offensive by the Assad regime seems likely to follow. Only “representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic’s army [should] stand at Syria’s border with Israel,” said Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister. Israel may not be satisfied even with that. Iranian forces continue to operate in other parts of Syria. An Iranian drone that entered Israeli airspace in February came from a base 150 miles away from the border. If Mr Assad and his Russian backers fail to contain Iran, more strikes are likely from Israel—and not just on Iranian targets. Israeli officials note that the sorties on May 10th also hit Syrian anti-aircraft missile batteries, provided by Russia. The balancing act may yet become more difficult for Russia. “The ‘let’s talk to everyone’ strategy will collapse sooner or later,” says Mr Kozhanov. “At some point a situation will arise when a serious choice has to be made.”"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/11/03/israels-prime-minister-visits-oman-an-arab-monarchy-and-is-welcomed,"TWO UNUSUAL photographs have been making the rounds on Arab social media. The first (pictured) is of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, being received by Sultan Qaboos of Oman at his palace in Muscat on October 26th. The second, taken three days later, is of Israel’s culture and sports minister, Miri Regev, with Emirati officials at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi. Responses to the photographs ranged from positive surprise to angry bemusement. Arabs, though, should get used to such scenes. Mr Netanyahu’s visit was the first by an Israeli prime minister to the Gulf in over two decades. Israel has full diplomatic relations with only two Arab countries, Egypt and Jordan. But its ties with the Gulf have been improving for years. A common enemy, Iran, has brought it closer to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The issue of the Palestinians, which long divided them, has been pushed to the back burner. Iran may also have come up during Mr Netanyahu’s visit to Muscat, which surprised even Gulf officials. Oman has maintained ties to the Islamic republic, annoying the Saudis and hawks in America. Welcoming Mr Netanyahu may blunt some of their criticism. It also makes Oman a potential interlocutor between Israel and Iran. Oman played a similar role, passing notes between America and Iran, during the Obama administration. No matter the purpose, the trip was important. It took months of secret negotiations, handled by the chief of Mossad, Israel’s spy agency. “Israel has historically maintained under-the-table ties with many nations,” says an Israeli diplomat. “The problem has always been how to bring these out in the open. With the visit to Oman, Netanyahu has broken a glass ceiling.”"
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/01/08/the-retreat-of-global-democracy-stopped-in-2018,"DEMOCRACY stopped declining in 2018, according to the latest edition of The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index. The index rates 167 countries by 60 indicators across five broad categories: electoral process and pluralism, the functioning of government, political participation, democratic political culture and civil liberties. It is stricter than most similar indices: it concludes that just 4.5% of the world’s people live in a “full democracy”. However, the overall global score remained stable in 2018 for the first time in three years. Just 42 countries experienced a decline, compared with 89 in 2017. Encouragingly, 48 improved. In recent years, threats to democracy around the world have become increasingly obvious. The Arab spring fizzled. China’s leader is poised to rule for life. Populists with autocratic tendencies have won elections in the Philippines, Brazil and Mexico and subverted democratic institutions in Hungary, Turkey and Poland. Perhaps because the trend is so glaring—strongmen in different countries often copy each other’s tactics, soundbites and scapegoats—voters are not taking it lying down. Political participation improved more than any other measure on the EIU’s index. This is true even in advanced democracies such as the United States, where voters are highly disgruntled. Polarisation in America has led to anger, gridlock and the current government shutdown. According to Gallup polls from January to mid-November 2018, the share of Americans who approve of the way that Congress is handling its job had fallen to an average of 18%, down from 40% in 2000. Perhaps because they are so cross, they are more likely to vote. Turnout at the 2018 mid-term elections was the highest for over 100 years. Parts of Europe are suffering from a democratic malaise. Italy fell from 21st to 33rd in the rankings after voters elected a populist coalition that seeks to bypass democratic institutions and curtail the civil liberties of immigrants and Roma. Turkey’s score declined for the sixth year in a row as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan swept aside most constraints on his power. Russia deteriorated for the tenth year in a row, after the main opposition candidate was barred from running in a presidential election and Vladimir Putin continued to crush civil liberties. Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia saw slight improvements in 2018, mostly reflecting higher scores for political participation. The report warns that all this may be a pause, rather than the end of democracy’s retreat. The global rise in engagement, combined with a continued crackdown on civil liberties such as freedom of expression, is a potentially volatile mix. It could be a recipe for instability in 2019.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/08/23/will-a-flurry-of-diplomacy-help-israel-and-the-palestinians,"DIPLOMATS often lament that the Israelis and Palestinians are not talking. You wouldn’t know it from the crowd of diplomats and spies parading around the region this summer. They shuttle between Jerusalem, Ramallah and Gaza, and Arab capitals from Cairo to the Gulf, for three tracks of negotiations. One is meant to avert a war between Israel and Hamas, the militant Islamist group that runs Gaza. A second aims to reconcile Hamas with its rival, Fatah, which governs the West Bank. And then there is Donald Trump’s pursuit of “the ultimate deal” between the Israelis and Palestinians. Yet when all the gabbing is done, the result will probably look much like the status quo. The truce talks involving Israel and Hamas are the most urgent. The two sides are closer to war than at any time since their last conflict in 2014. Tensions started to rise in March, when activists in Gaza organised protests over the decade-long blockade of the strip by Israel and Egypt. At their peak, tens of thousands of people took part. Israeli troops killed more than 50 of them on a single day in May. Hamas stopped encouraging the protests, fearing they would get out of hand. The crowds ebbed, but instead of the mostly peaceful rallies there is now escalating violence. Young Gazans have set fire to thousands of acres in Israel by flying burning kites and balloons across the border. Some used condoms as incendiary devices. Militant groups have fired hundreds of rockets at Israel, and Israel has dropped hundreds of bombs on Gaza. Each time the violence flares up diplomats scramble to broker a ceasefire. Their luck will not hold forever. So Israel and Hamas are talking indirectly about a longer-term deal. Hamas will stop the pyrotechnic prophylactics in exchange for freer movement of goods and people. The leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, told Gazans that “we are on the path to ending the blockade.” They will probably be disappointed. Israel and Egypt have already relaxed restrictions at the borders. Since May about 33,000 Palestinians have used the Rafah crossing with Egypt, a nearly tenfold increase compared to the same period last year. Traffic at the Erez border with Israel is up 58%. This is a marked improvement, but hardly free movement for 2m people. Nor will Gaza’s shattered economy be reopened to the world (indeed, commercial traffic is down this summer). Even this narrow truce is a political liability for the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who may call a snap election by spring (see article). His right-wing supporters are furious that Israel is negotiating under duress. A recent poll found that just 28% of voters in his Likud party support a deal with Hamas; 41% oppose it. The group holds the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed during the war of 2014. Israel wants them back. (It also has two living Israeli prisoners, a Bedouin and an Ethiopian Jew, whose plight gets less attention.) Hamas views them as leverage. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is also unhappy. His aides have been meeting Hamas officials in Cairo to discuss a deal that would see Hamas relinquish its control of Gaza. They signed a similar agreement in October. It was never implemented. Hamas gave up the bureaucracy, handing Fatah the thankless task of providing public services in Gaza. But it refused to disarm its militias. Last year Mr Abbas slapped his own sanctions on Gaza to exert pressure on Hamas. Strange as it may seem, Israel is now urging him to lift the measures, fearing they will complicate its own efforts to make a deal with the group. Ailing and 82 years old, Mr Abbas has kept the West Bank mostly quiet for a decade. His security forces work closely with their Israeli counterparts. He accepts the two-state solution. Yet he has nothing to show for it—not even the appearance of a peace process, let alone an actual deal. Israel spends more time negotiating (albeit indirectly) with Hamas, which it considers a terrorist group. Mr Abbas takes little comfort from the Trump administration’s fanciful efforts. The president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his special envoy, Jason Greenblatt, have spent 18 months touring the region. Their long-promised peace plan is still shrouded in mystery. No one knows when (or if) it will be released. Mr Trump has already moved the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and cut funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which helps Palestinian refugees. In a speech on August 21st, Mr Trump said the Palestinians would “get something very good” as compensation. To say they are sceptical would be an understatement. Veteran negotiators often treat the conflict as a problem of communication. If the parties would only come back to the table, they could make a deal. But those parties have talked for decades. Any Israeli or Palestinian can recite the details of a two-state solution. Hamas and Fatah have produced many reconciliation agreements. The issue is not a lack of talking. It is a lack of trust. A deal between Israel and Hamas might bring quiet to the border. It will also leave Mr Abbas weaker, and Hamas less inclined to a real reconciliation. Mr Trump has squandered whatever goodwill he had among the Palestinians. Even allied Arab states like Jordan are angry with him. If he does unveil a peace plan, it will enjoy little support. A poll published on August 13th found that just 43% of Palestinians and Israeli Jews back a two-state solution, the lowest figure in nearly two decades (see chart). Twenty-five years after the Oslo accords, which were meant to end the conflict, it is a struggle just to stop things getting worse."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/07/26/israels-jewish-nationalist-identity-is-outweighing-its-democratic-one,"“THIS is a pivotal moment in the history of Zionism and the state of Israel,” said Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister (pictured), in the early hours of July 19th. Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, had just passed a law stating that the right of national self-determination is “unique to the Jewish people”. Israel’s non-Jewish citizens were excluded. The nation-state law, as it is known, was necessary “to ensure the foundation of our existence”, said Mr Netanyahu. But Arab Knesset members called it the “law of Jewish supremacy” and chanted “apartheid”. The nation-state law seems designed to offend Israel’s minorities. It repeats clauses from other laws, but eschews the section of the declaration of independence that commits Israel to the “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex”. Israel has always struggled to balance that pledge against its status as a Jewish state. Unofficial discrimination has existed for decades, in that Arabs receive fewer state resources than Jews. What is new is that lawmakers in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition are seeking to codify inequality in law. In fact the nation-state law is not as sweeping as Mr Netanyahu’s grandiose language suggests. In lieu of a constitution, the Knesset has, over the years, passed a series of “basic laws”. One, from 1992, enshrines the same civil rights for all citizens. The new measure, also a basic law, does not change that. Harder-line drafts were watered down during years of political wrangling. A clause that would have promoted Jewish-only communities was replaced with a vague commitment to “Jewish settlement”. Another specifies that Hebrew is Israel’s “official language”, while Arabic, spoken by a quarter of the population, merely has “special status”. Yet the use of Arabic in the public domain has grown on Mr Netanyahu’s watch. In arguing for the nation-state law, Mr Netanyahu may have been motivated by the search for votes rather than by state-building. Anxious to win a fifth term in elections that must be held by late next year, the prime minister looks set on repeating his strategy from 2015, when he exhorted nationalists to “protect the state of Israel” against “the Arab voters moving in droves to the polling stations”. To keep his coalition together, he has often acceded to his ultra-Orthodox and nationalist allies. But many are still frustrated. Because the nation-state law is only declaratory, few think it will sway Israel’s Supreme Court, which often rules in favour of democratic values over Jewish nationalist ones. Critics of Mr Netanyahu’s government, one of the most right-wing and religious in Israel’s history, say the nation-state law is indicative of its efforts to make Israel less democratic and more illiberal. It has passed laws aimed at weakening the courts and stifling the press and civil-rights groups. It has kowtowed to conservative supporters, exacerbating tensions within Israeli society. And it has made little effort to seek peace with the Palestinians. But Mr Netanyahu is under little pressure to change his ways. President Donald Trump has backed him, for example by recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Much of the Arab world is working with Mr Netanyahu to counter Iran. And the Israeli opposition is too weak to pose a credible threat to the government. Despite the new law, Israel’s democracy is robust. The Knesset contains a wide range of views (the nation-state law passed by 62 votes to 55). The legal system holds power to account—in recent years it has sent both a prime minister and a president to prison for criminal offences. Mr Netanyahu himself is facing numerous investigations over corruption. The Israeli press is free and refreshingly irreverent towards politicians. Efforts by the government to stifle dissent have been diluted or failed because of judicial and media opposition and a lack of support within the ruling coalition, which commands a small majority. On the same morning the new basic law passed, police detained a progressive rabbi in Haifa for carrying out Jewish marriages without the approval of the state Rabbinate, which is ultra-Orthodox. A day earlier Mr Netanyahu was forced to vote against a measure, which he had previously endorsed, that would have allowed gay men to have children with a surrogate mother. His reversal was a sop to his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners. The new law does not resolve these conflicts. Even Israelis themselves cannot agree on what it means to be a Jewish state."
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/05/17/israel-at-70,"THESE are joyous days for Israel. As the Jewish state celebrates its 70th anniversary, it is enjoying sustained economic growth (see chart), its lowest unemployment rate in decades, booming high-tech exports and a growing list of international companies eager to set up research centres on its soil. In an unstable region, Israel is more secure than ever. Arab states around it are in chaos and regional powers including Egypt and Saudi Arabia are eager to form alliances to confront Iran and Islamists. A procession of world leaders visits Jerusalem. Binyamin Netanyahu, its prime minister, is well received in capitals across the globe. Israel’s foreign relations have never seemed in such good health. This week’s relocation of the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is a moment of glory. And Israel even won the Eurovision Song Contest, despite not being in Europe. Much has contributed to Israel’s success. A transition from a centralised economy, beginning in 1985, kept it from an inflationary meltdown, while it also hung on to popular parts of its socialist legacy such as a free national-health service and a decent education system. A highly skilled workforce, including many young people trained by the Israeli army and 1m immigrants who arrived during the collapse of the Soviet Union, has built many high-tech businesses. Pressure on Israel to solve its conflict with the Palestinians, who share the same small parcel of land between the Mediterranean and Jordan river, has eased. Arab governments have other worries, and often value Israeli trade and security co-operation much more than paying lip service to the Palestinian cause. Donald Trump likes Israel just the way it is. But Israel should not celebrate too wildly. Israeli-Arabs, many of them poor, struggle to integrate. And ultra-Orthodox Jews, whose numbers are rising fast, often do not work. The two groups make up over 30% of the population, putting a strain on Israel’s welfare state. Technological success is fuelling resentment among those left behind in the “old economy”. Infrastructure is creaking and public transport is dilapidated. Xenophobia towards non-Jews and African refugees is on the increase. Although this resembles the problems of most Western democracies, Israel faces unique challenges, too. It lacks a political consensus to draft a constitution that will safeguard its democracy. Unresolved contradictions of state and synagogue allow the Orthodox rabbinate sole control over marriage and divorce. Israel’s concept of citizenship, based on serving as a haven for all Jews, is hopelessly outdated. Above all looms the Palestinian issue. Foreign pressure on Israel may have subsided, but 4.5m demoralised and divided Palestinians live in Gaza and the West Bank. The good news is that Israel still has plenty of scope to develop its economy, particularly if it can find ways to integrate the groups that have been left behind. The bad news is that Mr Netanyahu, who has based his electoral success on divisive politics and the fear of Arabs, shows little inclination to use Israel’s moment of advantage to seek a lasting peace with Palestinians."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/05/17/how-to-end-the-endless-conflict-between-israel-and-the-palestinians,"GAZA is a human rubbish-heap that everyone would rather ignore. Neither Israel, nor Egypt, nor even the Palestinian Authority (PA) wants to take responsibility for it. Sometimes the poison gets out—when, say, rockets or other attacks provoke a fully fledged war. And then the world is forced to take note. Such a moment came on May 14th. Tens of thousands of Palestinians massed near Gaza’s border fence, threatening to “return” to the lands their forefathers lost when Israel was created in 1948. Israeli soldiers killed about 60 protesters—the bloodiest day in Gaza since the war in 2014 (see Briefing). In a surreal split-screen moment, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, was exulting over the opening of America’s embassy in Jerusalem, calling it a “great day for peace”. Many countries have denounced Israel; a few have recalled diplomats. Some people accuse it of war crimes. Others blame President Donald Trump for causing the clashes by moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It is surely right to hold Israel, the strong side, to high standards. But Palestinian parties, though weak, are also to blame. Seven decades after the creation of Israel as a thriving democracy, there is a better way than endless conflict and bloodshed. Every state has a right to defend its borders. To judge by the numbers, Israel’s army may well have used excessive force. But any firm conclusion requires an independent assessment of what happened, where and when. The Israelis sometimes used non-lethal means, such as tear-gas dropped from drones. But then snipers went to work with bullets. What changed? Mixed in with protesters, it seems, were an unknown number of Hamas attackers seeking to breach the fence. What threat did they pose? Any fair judgment depends on the details. Just as important is the broader political question. The fence between Gaza and Israel is no ordinary border. Gaza is a prison, not a state. Measuring 365 square kilometres and home to 2m people, it is one of the most crowded and miserable places on Earth. It is short of medicine, power and other essentials. The tap water is undrinkable; untreated sewage is pumped into the sea. Gaza already has one of the world’s highest jobless rates, at 44%. The scene of three wars between Hamas and Israel since 2007, it is always on the point of eruption. Many hands are guilty for this tragedy. Israel insists that the strip is not its problem, having withdrawn its forces in 2005. But it still controls Gaza from land, sea and air. Any Palestinian, even a farmer, coming within 300 metres of the fence is liable to be shot. Israel restricts the goods that get in. Only a tiny number of Palestinians can get out for, say, medical treatment. Israeli generals have long warned against letting the economy collapse. Mr Netanyahu usually ignores them. Egypt also contributes to the misery. The Rafah crossing to Sinai, another escape valve, was open to goods and people for just 17 days in the first four months of this year. And Fatah, which administers the PA and parts of the West Bank, has withheld salaries for civil servants working for the PA in Gaza, limited shipments of necessities, such as drugs and baby milk, and cut payments to Israel for Gaza’s electricity. Hamas bears much of the blame, too. It all but destroyed the Oslo peace accords through its campaign of suicide-bombings in the 1990s and 2000s. Having driven the Israelis out of Gaza, it won a general election in 2006 and, after a brief civil war, expelled Fatah from the strip in 2007. It has misruled Gaza ever since, proving corrupt, oppressive and incompetent. It stores its weapons in civilian sites, including mosques and schools, making them targets. Cement that might be used for reconstruction is diverted to build underground tunnels to attack Israel. Hamas all but admitted it was not up to governing when it agreed to hand many administrative tasks to the PA last year as part of a reconciliation deal with Fatah. But the pact collapsed because Hamas is not prepared to give up its weapons. Israel, Egypt and the PA cannot just lock away the Palestinians in Gaza in the hope that Hamas will be overthrown. Only when Gazans live more freely might they think of getting rid of their rulers. Much more can be done to ease Gazans’ plight without endangering Israel’s security. But no lasting solution is possible until the question of Palestine is solved, too. Mr Netanyahu has long resisted the idea of a Palestinian state—and has kept building settlements on occupied land. It is hard to convince Israelis to change. As Israel marks its 70th birthday, the economy is booming. By “managing” the conflict, rather than trying to end it, Mr Netanyahu has kept Palestinian violence in check while giving nothing away. When violence flares Israel’s image suffers, but not much. The Trump administration supports it. And Arab states seeking an ally against a rising Iran have never had better relations with it. Israel is wrong to stop seeking a deal. And Mr Trump is wrong to prejudge the status of Jerusalem. But Palestinians have made it easy for Israel to claim that there is “no partner for peace”, divided as they are between a tired nationalist Fatah that cannot deliver peace, and an Islamist Hamas that refuses to do so. Palestinians desperately need new leaders. Fatah must renew itself through long-overdue elections. And Hamas must realise that its rockets damage Palestinian dreams of statehood more than they hurt Israel. For all their talk of non-violence, Hamas’s leaders have not abandoned the idea of “armed struggle” to destroy Israel. They refuse to give up their guns, or fully embrace a two-state solution; they speak vaguely of a long-term “truce”. With this week’s protests, Hamas’s leaders boasted of freeing a “wild tiger”. They found that Israel can be even more ferocious. If Hamas gave up its weapons, it would open the way for a rapprochement with Fatah. If it accepted Israel’s right to exist, it would expose Israel’s current unwillingness to allow a Palestinian state. If Palestinians marched peacefully, without guns and explosives, they would take the moral high ground. In short, if Palestinians want Israel to stop throttling them, they must first convince Israelis it is safe to let go."
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/02/02/israels-growing-settlements-force-stark-choices-about-its-future," ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN peace talks are frozen. President Donald Trump’s plan for the “deal of the century” has been put off. The subject is absent in campaigning for the Israeli election in April, which focuses on looming corruption charges against Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister. The Oslo accords of 1993 created a crazy quilt of autonomous zones in the lands that Israel captured in 1967. They also kindled the hope of creating a Palestinian state in most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital in East Jerusalem. After much bloodshed, though, most Israelis are wary of this “two-state solution”. Today Palestinians are mostly shut off by security barriers, and divided. The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank refuses to negotiate with Israel but co-operates on security. Its Islamist rival, Hamas, which runs Gaza, dares not risk another war, for now. Besides, the growth of Jewish settlements makes a two-state deal ever harder. Establishing a Palestinian state would probably require the removal of settlers in its territory. Israel had trouble enough evicting 8,000 Jews from Gaza in 2005. There are more than fifty times as many in the West Bank. Even excluding East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel, the number of Jews east of the “green line” (the pre-1967 border) has risen from 110,000 in 1993 to 425,000. New home approvals nearly quadrupled from 5,000 in 2015-16 to 19,000 in 2017-18, according to Peace Now, a pressure group. Such “facts on the ground” follow a pattern: more intense building in East Jerusalem and close to the green line; less so deeper in the West Bank. In theory, a line could be drawn to incorporate the vast majority of settlers within Israel. The route of the existing and planned barriers would take in 77% of the West Bank’s settlers (or 85%, counting East Jerusalem). But this creates deep salients that break up Palestinian areas and cut them off from Jerusalem. As Palestinians lose hope for a state of their own, some favour a “one-state” deal: a single state on all the land with equal rights for Jews and Arabs. Israel would have to give up its predominantly Jewish identity. That is because, between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river, the overall number of Arabs has caught up with that of Jews, and may soon exceed them. This creates a “trilemma” for Israel. It cannot have at the same time a strong Jewish majority, all the land and a full democracy that does not discriminate against Arabs. In the end it must sacrifice either land in a two-state solution; or a Jewish majority in a big “binational” state; or the claim to being a proper democracy. It has tried to avoid such stark choices through messy partial withdrawals. But the more permanent its occupation becomes, the more it risks sliding towards apartheid.

https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/12/05/for-15-years-two-currencies-have-outperformed-all-others,"THE PAST decade and a half has seen boom and bust, inflation and deflation, globalisation and trade tensions. Through such economic and political cycles you might expect currencies to go in and out of fashion. In fact the two that have strengthened the most against the dollar over this period—Thailand’s baht and Israel’s shekel—have done so consistently. They have outshone other currencies over one, five and ten years, too. What explains their popularity? Inflation is part of the answer. Exchange rates partly reflect relative purchasing power, so a country with low inflation should see its currency strengthen against that of a country where prices are rising fast. Both Israel and Thailand have had low annual inflation: 1.4% and 2.2% respectively, on average, over the past 15 years. Another factor that causes exchange rates to move is one country becoming relatively more productive than another. Economic growth is a reasonable proxy of productivity, and Israel and Thailand have had fast growth. (China has also grown quickly, but the yuan has been hit hard by the trade war.) One curiosity is why both currencies have performed well over each of the four time horizons. The answer may reflect policy. Both Israel and Thailand intervene in markets to limit upward pressure on their currencies. If they are very strict, currency regimes can end abruptly, as when Switzerland abandoned its peg in January 2015. But Israel and Thailand have been more flexible, which has strung out their appreciations over time."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/07/11/the-killing-of-a-black-jew-sparks-protests-in-israel,"THE VIOLENT protests that shook Israel on July 2nd had all the hallmarks of race riots. A young black man had been shot dead by an off-duty policeman in unclear circumstances. Thousands of Ethiopian Jews took to the streets, throwing stones at police officers, blocking roads and overturning police cars. Their claims of systematic racism and police brutality were met, on the whole, with condescending denial. Politicians chided them for the violence, while issuing vague expressions of sympathy. Few bluntly mentioned the word racism. Media outlets and pundits supporting the government aired conspiracy theories suggesting that left-wing organisations had incited the violence. Nearly all the Jews in Ethiopia, whose ancestors had lived in Africa for centuries, moved to Israel quite recently. Big airlifts began in the 1980s, when Ethiopia suffered tyranny and famine. A sympathetic Israel welcomed them with open arms, though rabbis had long debated whether the Beta Israel, as they are known, were really Jewish (and therefore eligible for Israeli citizenship). Today there are 150,000 of them in Israel (1.7% of the population). They have suffered a range of indignities (though none to compare with life as it was back in Ethiopia). The Chief Rabbinate, which regulates marriage, demanded that they undergo a full conversion process to Judaism. Health authorities rejected their blood donations, fearing HIV. Complaints of racism have been generally dismissed. In 2012 an immigration minister scolded Ethiopian-Israeli activists, telling them to “say thank you for what you have received”. Ethiopian-Israeli minors are three times as likely to be arrested as their non-black counterparts. In 2016 Israel’s police commissioner said it was “natural” for his officers to be more suspicious of Ethiopian-Israelis (and indeed Israeli-Arabs). The justice ministry’s anti-racism unit says the number of arrests has dipped since then, but the Ethiopians still feel “overpoliced”. “Despite all the efforts to integrate into Israeli society, the feeling of young men and women confronted every day with racist remarks is that when they get pulled over by police they have nothing to lose,” says Asher Seyoum, a former member of parliament and the first Ethiopian-Israeli to have been appointed head of the Jewish Agency in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital. Unlike most previous waves of immigrants to Israel, who often arrived well-schooled and credentialled, most Ethiopian Jews had been subsistence farmers. Few arrived with the skills to thrive in a high-tech economy. It is taking time for them to catch up. Among the younger generation of black Jews, most were born in Israel or have spent most of their lives there. In the past decade only 22% who left high school went on to higher education, half the national average. That is progress, of course. Children raised in families with little tradition of literacy seldom do as well as those from more bookish backgrounds. But many would like to see them catch up faster. A classic Israeli comedy sketch shows each wave of Jewish immigrants over the past century or so—from Russia, Poland, Yemen, Germany and Morocco—arriving on the promised land’s shore and immediately joining those already on the beach to hurl abuse at the next wave. The most recent wave, from Ethiopia, faces tougher obstacles than most."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/02/09/an-odd-hebrew-word-says-a-lot-about-israeli-politics,"IT IS NOT easy to translate the Hebrew word davka. It means something like “despite it all” and “because of”, but with a sense of deliberate precision: I was at home all day, but the delivery man came davka during the half-hour when I was out. It can connote an intent to irritate: my girlfriend knows we disagree about politics, but she always davka brings it up. In 2003 Ariel Sharon, a pugnacious former prime minister, cited a young American explaining the word to friends back home: “Davka means doing or thinking something both in spite of and because of a given situation.” Curiously, Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has chosen as his campaign slogan “Davka Netanyahu”. In December Israeli police recommended that Mr Netanyahu be indicted for bribery and breach of trust. The prime minister says the charges are a witch-hunt by lefty prosecutors and journalists. Many supporters of his hawkish Likud party come from religious or working-class backgrounds, and many are Sephardi Jews, descended from immigrants from the Arab world, rather than Ashkenazi Jews, who trace their roots to Europe and are typically richer. Mr Netanyahu’s davka is an invitation to his supporters to stick a finger in the eye of the elite: vote for me not just despite the corruption charges, but because of them. This populist way of thinking is becoming familiar all over the world. At its heart lies the politics of resentment. Backers of President Donald Trump enthusiastically call themselves “deplorables”, embracing a term Hillary Clinton used to describe some of them. In Britain, Brexit supporters suggest that, in case of a second referendum, the Leave campaign should employ the rallying cry “Tell them again”. Such slogans appeal not to the merits of the cause, but to supporters’ resentment at being a target of condescension. The great philosopher of resentment was Friedrich Nietzsche, who thought it had a lot to do with Jews. In “On the Genealogy of Morality”, he describes the politics of resentment as a Jewish invention that lies at the core of Judeo-Christian ethics. In pagan morality, according to Nietzsche, the good is synonymous with the excellent and the powerful: rulers and gods are good because they are beautiful and strong. Judaism and Christianity, resentful of pagan rule, inverted this morality. They saw the weak masses as good, whereas precisely (davka!) the strong rulers were evil. This “slave morality”, Nietzsche thought, was behind all of Western civilisation. He detested it. Nietzsche’s account of morality’s evolution is a fascinating mess with little relationship to historical reality. However, his analysis of resentment was picked up by thinkers like Sigmund Freud and Hannah Arendt, and has become crucial to the understanding of populism and authoritarianism. Still, it is strange that the politics of resentment should be employed davka by Mr Netanyahu, who is an unlikely underdog. The scion of a renowned Ashkenazi family, Mr Netanyahu grew up in America before returning to Israel to serve in an elite commando unit—a crucial distinction in a society where military service affects social class. He has been a dominant figure in Israeli politics for more than two decades. He and Likud have helped pull Israel’s political centre in a hawkish direction, winning power and all but ending the prospects for a Palestinian state. The real political outcasts in Israel are surely Likud’s opponents, the remnants of the peace movement. They are the ones who must urge their dwindling band of supporters to continue hoping for the seemingly impossible, davka."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/09/19/the-reign-of-bibi-netanyahu-is-ending,"HIS DEVOTEES call him King Bibi, but the crown is slipping. Twice this year Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has gone to the country to ask voters for a clear majority. Twice they have denied him one. With almost all the votes counted from the ballot on September 17th, Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party was two seats behind Blue and White, a centrist alliance led by Benny Gantz, a former military chief. Mr Netanyahu’s coalition of right-wing and religious parties fell six short of a majority, a larger shortfall than at the previous election in April. Mr Netanyahu (pictured, left) still hopes to cling to power as Mr Gantz (right), too, has no clear path to a governing coalition. Yet the era of King Bibi is surely coming to a close. Having lost his majority, Mr Netanyahu has lost almost all hope of obtaining immunity from prosecution on three counts of alleged corruption. And he has lost the aura of invincibility given by four terms and 13 years in power. Liberals in Israel and around the world may dare to believe that, at last, Mr Netanyahu’s brand of ethno-nationalist politics can be defeated. Israel now has a chance to return to a more sane democratic politics. But only a chance. Much will depend on how the coalition horse-trading plays out. By nosing ahead, Mr Gantz has the better claim to try to form a cabinet. But Mr Netanyahu remains caretaker prime minister until another government is formed. Even if he somehow stays in office, he will be much diminished. He will have to share power with his enemies—whether Mr Gantz or, worse, Avigdor Lieberman, an ex-aide who split with him and thwarted him. The best Mr Netanyahu can hope for is a government of national unity in which he and Mr Gantz take turns as leader. Even so, he will be vulnerable to prosecution and abandonment by allies. In March this newspaper described Mr Netanyahu’s tenure as a parable of modern populism. He embraced muscular nationalism and elite-bashing long before these became a global force (though he adopted more sensible economic policies). During the campaign he reverted to type: although after 13 years in power he can hardly claim to be the underdog, he cast himself as the champion of the people against the elite. He claimed that policemen and prosecutors dogging him were leftists, even though he appointed many of them. The journalists who questioned him were denounced for purveying false news, though Israel Hayom, the biggest freesheet, is so loyal that Israelis call it bibiton (iton is Hebrew for newspaper). Mr Netanyahu sowed distrust of Arab citizens. He accused Arab parties of fraud; a chatbot message on his Facebook page, since withdrawn, accused them of trying “to destroy us all”. As ever, he highlighted the threat of Iran and his friendship with President Donald Trump, who recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Above all, Mr Netanyahu sought to mobilise his right-wing base, promising to annex part of the occupied West Bank if re-elected. None of these tactics worked, and some backfired. The threat to place cameras in polling stations, supposedly to deter Arab voter fraud, instead provoked a large Arab turnout. What were once acts of bravura from the man known as “the magician” now look like tired old stunts. His potential replacement, Mr Gantz, presents himself as a warrior who wants peace, but has been worryingly vague about his policies. Do not expect him to rush into a deal with the Palestinians. A two-state peace deal, with a Palestinian state alongside Israel, may seem desirable to most of the world but appeals to only about half of Israelis. And many of them think it is unachievable right now: moderate Palestinians are too weak, and the radicals strong enough to spoil any accord. Most Israelis reckon the conflict can only be managed, not solved. At least under Mr Gantz some sort of dialogue with Palestinians might resume, and the threat of unilateral annexation will recede; perhaps there can be partial deals. If Mr Gantz makes a difference, it is more likely to be to the tenor of Israeli politics, whose drift towards intolerant ethno-nationalism he might arrest. That said, what brought Mr Netanyahu down was not a victory of the peace camp, but a betrayal among nationalists. Mr Lieberman, formerly Mr Netanyahu’s chief of staff, has become Israel’s kingmaker. His breakaway party, Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel, Our Home), made bigger gains than any other by promising not to join any government unless it introduced secular reforms, which would in turn break Likud’s alliance with ultra-religious parties. That is welcome, but Yisrael Beiteinu is hardly liberal. It is more rabidly nationalist than Likud, having often led efforts to delegitimise Arab parties, and Mr Lieberman has been fending off accusations of corruption for as long as Mr Netanyahu has. It is tempting to conclude that the parable has a hopeful moral: populism has found its limits; the institutions of liberal democracy can stand up to it. But the weakening of one kind of populism may simply have strengthened another. The work of embattled liberals in Israel, and elsewhere, is far from done. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/01/12/how-silicon-makes-israels-desert-bloom,"PINK BOLLWORMS are the scourge of cotton farmers. The insect is less than an inch long, but it has a voracious appetite for the plant’s seeds. As a child living on Kibbutz Ginosar, in Israel’s north, Ofir Schlam would wake up at dawn to inspect leaves for the pest. “They were really hard to find,” he recalls. Spotting the enemy has become much easier. Four years ago, Mr Schlam co-founded Taranis, a company that uses high-resolution imagery from drones, planes and satellites to diagnose problems in the field—among them bollworms, diseases, dryness and nutrient deficiencies. Investors are joining the effort: in November, Taranis raised $20m. Faced with unfriendly neighbours and an arid climate, Israel has had to innovate to survive. Taranis is the poster child of its stunning rise in agritech. Over 500 companies operate in the field, nearly twice as many as in the better-known cyber-security sector. A third of them did not exist five years ago. Israeli agritech firms attracted $171m in equity investment in 2017, according to Start-Up Nation Central, a non-profit organisation, considerably more than those in bigger farming countries, such as Australia and Brazil. Other countries have bet big on agritech, but Israel is ahead of all but America, say investors. Large countries with big appetites are taking notice. When Wang Qishan, China’s vice-president, visited Israel in October, he toured agritech exhibits. “Agricultural parks” using Israeli technology have mushroomed across China. Indian and African officials have also made recent trips to Israel seeking inspiration. Because it trades little with its neighbours, Israel long relied on the kibbutzim and other collective farms to grow food for its rising population. That heritage is providing rich pickings today: 54% of Israel’s agritech ventures are managed by someone who grew up in a kibbutz. Conditions forced them to be creative. The southern part of the country often receives less rainfall in a year than England gets in a day. That led to an early breakthrough in water management. In the 1950s Simcha Blass and his son, Yeshayahu, greatly reduced water use by applying it directly to the roots of plants. They helped form Netafim, the world’s leading maker of drip-irrigation systems, worth nearly $1.9bn. Newer companies are exploiting technological advances in areas such as plant biology and artificial intelligence. Startups founded in Israel last year include Sufresca, which is developing edible coatings that extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables; Beewise, which uses artificial intelligence to automate beehive maintenance; and Armenta, which is working on new therapies to treat sick dairy cows. Other firms are targeting trendy sectors like pharmaceutical crops and alternative proteins. The new firms benefit from an oversupply of produce worldwide, which has led to lower margins for farmers and greater demand for tools that increase productivity and boost profits. After an unprecedented round of mergers in 2016, farming giants have been looking to cut costs. Shareholders are also looking for new ways of doing things (six out of the ten biggest food companies have replaced their CEOs in the past three years). Many firms see external innovation as faster and cheaper than in-house research and development (R&D). Israel’s overall civilian R&D spending, measured as a share of GDP, is more than that of any European country. Agritech gets a chunk of this cash. The government supports universities and labs; it has also invested in venture-capital funds and directly in startups. The country is good at turning ideas into profits. The Israel Institute of Technology (known as Technion) earns over half as much licensing patents as MIT in America, despite spending much less on research. Next year, for the first time, the government plans to sponsor pilot projects that connect startups with farmers, so that technology can be tried and tested locally before being introduced to international markets. The state also helps in other ways. Military service is mandatory in Israel, where bright young conscripts spend years developing equipment or software that does well in unpredictable environments. Such skills have direct applications in agritech. Nadav Liebermann, the chief technology officer of CropX, a company that uses wireless sensors to measure soil moisture, served in a unit that created hardware for special forces, including devices placed underground in enemy territory to gather intelligence. His software chief, who learned to code in the army, ran a team of 50 developers at the age of 23. Two branches are particularly good at churning out tech entrepreneurs: Unit 8200, the army’s signals-intelligence arm, and Unit 9900, which specialises in gleaning intelligence from geospatial imagery. The next challenge for Israel’s agritech firms will be scaling up. Limited farmland means they must look for partners abroad early on. So does the need to understand distant export markets with a different climate, like Brazil or the American Midwest. Founders of startups are often quick to sell up, rather than building their ventures into big global companies. Many reinvest their riches in new startups and buyers often continue to use Israel as their base for R&D. The danger is that, without bigger home-grown firms, many less-skilled Israelis—including kibbutzniks—will be cut off from the booming tech industry."
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/03/30/binyamin-netanyahu-a-parable-of-modern-populism,"HIS DEVOTEES call him “The Magician”, “The Winner” and—the ultimate accolade—melekh yisrael, “King of Israel”. Binyamin Netanyahu is Israel’s most gifted politician in a generation. He is his country’s second-longest-serving prime minister and, if he wins his fifth election on April 9th, may beat the record of the country’s founding father, David Ben Gurion. “Bibi”, as he is known by all, is important beyond Israel, too, and not only because he speaks in perfect soundbites in both Hebrew and English and stands tall in today’s chaotic Middle East. He matters because he embodied the politics of muscular nationalism, chauvinism and the resentment of elites long before such populism became a global force. Mr Netanyahu counts among his friends and allies such nationalists as Donald Trump and Narendra Modi, not to mention European ones from Viktor Orban in Hungary to Matteo Salvini in Italy. The reign of King Bibi is thus a parable of modern politics: the rise of a talented politician and a long success based on a perplexing mixture of carrying out sound policy and cynically sowing division. As his power is threatened, he has turned to railing more loudly against the free press, the judiciary and shadowy forces. Now Bibi faces his greatest danger, in the form of criminal charges for corruption. In a different age he would have had to resign, and would now be defending himself as an ordinary citizen. But he is intent on remaining in office, and hopes that voters will yet save him from the policemen, prosecutors and judges. Israeli politics is turning into a contest between genuine achievement and demagoguery on one side and the rule of law on the other. All who care about democracy should watch closely. Little Israel commands attention because it has a big history: biblical romance and technological talent; the slaughter of the Holocaust and military prowess; energetic democracy and the long occupation of land claimed and inhabited by Palestinians. That said, Mr Netanyahu is a big figure in his own right (see article). He is more intelligent and capable than many populists, and can claim plenty of successes. By shrinking the bloated state he has helped Israel’s economy flourish, particularly its tech startups. With deft use of diplomacy and the mostly cautious use of military force, he has boosted security without being sucked into disastrous wars. Thanks to that and a shared hostility to Iran, relations with many Arab rulers are better than at any time in Israel’s history. Yet Mr Netanyahu is also worryingly dogmatic. He has paid lip service to peace with Palestinians but has taken no meaningful steps towards it. He has denounced any Western co-operation with Iran, even if it served to limit Iran’s nuclear programme. In Bibi’s pessimistic view, Israel is surrounded by wolves in sheep’s clothing and wolves in wolves’ clothing. Israel can only manage conflicts, not solve them, he believes, so it must rely on an iron wall and the passage of time. Such “anti-solutionism” risks storing trouble for the future. It increases the danger of war with Iran, or of its hardliners making a dash for nukes. The more Israel entrenches itself in the West Bank, the more its “temporary” military occupation looks like the permanent subjugation of Palestinians under a separate law, even apartheid. This is made worse by the absence of America’s restraining influence. Mr Netanyahu has warmly embraced Mr Trump, who in turn has showered him with gifts, most recently his endorsement of Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights. Might Mr Trump also back Israel’s annexation of bits of the West Bank, so denying Palestinians the hope of statehood? In the long run Bibi’s overt alignment with America’s Republicans and the evangelical right endangers the bipartisan pro-Israeli consensus in Washington that is the foundation of Israel’s security. But the greatest threat from Bibi’s reign has been at home. He has kept power not just on the strength of his record but also by seeking political advantage at the cost of eroding Israel’s democratic norms. In claiming that no peace with Palestinians is possible (or desirable), members of his right-wing coalition outbid each other to pass measures asserting Jewish supremacy. Mr Netanyahu pushed for an electoral pact with the hitherto untouchable far-right Jewish Power group, which wants to annex all the occupied territories and “encourage” Arabs, including Israeli citizens, to leave. He has played us-and-them politics for so long that he has exacerbated the country’s many schisms—between Jews and Arabs, diaspora Jews and Israelis, western Ashkenazi and eastern Mizrahi Jews, and secular and religious ones. By casting himself as uniquely able to protect Israel against its enemies, he often treats those who say otherwise as wimps or traitors. Mr Netanyahu and his friends denounce as backstabbers any Jews who stand in their way. The free press peddles fake news. Political opponents, even the generals who pack the new Blue and White opposition party, are in cahoots with the Arabs. Bibi has flirted with the conspiracy theory beloved of anti-Semites that George Soros, a Jewish billionaire, is plotting to undermine nationalist governments around the world. The corruption charges against him, says Mr Netanyahu, amount to a “blood libel”—a vile medieval canard that accused Jews of mixing the blood of murdered Christian children in their Passover bread. Yet the police chief who investigated the charges, and the attorney-general who ordered his indictment, were both hand-picked by Mr Netanyahu. His allies want a law that would grant a prime minister immunity from prosecution. Israel is an outlier among Western democracies. It was born as the state of the Jews; Zionism and Palestinian nationalism claim the same land. Israel must contend with a genuine “other” and existential threats, not the bogeymen invented by populists elsewhere. The left, in disarray in many countries, suffered a body-blow in Israel because its attempt to negotiate a land-for-peace deal with Palestinians collapsed into bloodshed. Yet precisely because of these pressures, Israel offers an important test of the resilience of democracy. On April 9th Israeli voters face a fateful choice. Re-elect Mr Netanyahu and reward him for subverting the independence of Israel’s institutions. Or turf him out in the hope of rebuilding trust in democracy—and aspiring to be “a light unto the nations”."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/08/29/new-fronts-open-up-in-the-conflict-between-israel-and-iran,"AN EXPLOSION AND subsequent fire in the early hours of August 25th in Beirut’s Dahiye neighbourhood led to fevered speculation. Were they caused by two quadcopter drones, one of which was captured in a shaky video moments before? Were the drones Israeli or Iranian? Was the intended target a media office of Hizbullah, as the Lebanese militia suggested? Or was the target Iranian-supplied equipment to improve the guidance systems of Hizbullah missiles, as anonymous “intelligence services” claimed? One thing seems sure: the episode is part of a broadening of the battlefields between Israel and Iran. Lebanon was one of the earliest frontlines. Iran helped found Hizbullah there in 1985 to fight the Israeli army, which had invaded its northern neighbour. More recently the conflict has expanded to Iraq. A series of explosions there has been ascribed to Israel. “Iran doesn’t have immunity anywhere,” said Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, neither confirming nor denying responsibility. Israel accuses Iran of spreading missile and attack-drone technology. The sites targeted in Iraq are bases of Iranian-backed militias which may have been storing Iranian missiles. The explosion in Beirut came just hours after an Israeli air strike near Damascus, where a team of Iranian and Hizbullah operatives were said to have been preparing to launch drones against Israel, apparently in retaliation for the attacks in Iraq. This time Mr Netanyahu was quick to acknowledge responsibility. (Lebanon’s state media claimed that Israel also struck the base of a Palestinian organisation aligned with Iran and Hizbullah near the Lebanon-Syria border on August 26th.) The world’s attention, meanwhile, was on diplomacy. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, engineered a surprise visit by Iran’s foreign minister, Muhammad Javad Zarif, to the G7 summit in Biarritz. Mr Macron has been trying to salvage the nuclear deal signed by Iran and six world powers in 2015. The agreement limits Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for the partial lifting of sanctions. President Donald Trump withdrew from it last year and embarked on a policy of “maximum pressure” to cripple Iran’s economy. Mr Macron dangled the prospect of a summit between Mr Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani. Mr Trump seemed tempted by the idea. So did Mr Rouhani, at first. “If I know that by meeting someone, the problem of my country will be solved, I will not hesitate,” he said in a speech. But, under pressure from hardliners, he later backed away, saying that there can be no meeting unless America first lifts its sanctions on Iran. Israel is keen for America to maintain pressure on Iran. It worries about the strategy of regional expansion championed by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and supported by the country’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. In recent weeks Israeli officials have warned that this strategy now includes a full rapprochement with Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement in Gaza. Ties between them were cut off in the early years of the Syrian uprising when Iran backed Bashar al-Assad’s regime, which was butchering Hamas’s Sunni coreligionists. With the war in Syria all but over, normal service has been resumed. Iranian support for Hamas is reckoned to be as much as $100m a year. But the Iranian network may have become overextended and easier for rival espionage agencies to penetrate. Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes on Iranian targets in Syria. Senior Israeli officers claim they have succeeded in preventing Iran from establishing missile bases there. Until recently Israel maintained a policy of “opaqueness” regarding its strikes against Iranian targets. Mr Netanyahu, however, has taken to extolling Israel’s intelligence-gathering and operational successes in surprising detail, as well as openly saying it carried out the latest air strike in Syria. Some of his critics in Israel’s security and political establishments are uncomfortable with this. They see a link between his sudden transparency and Israel’s parliamentary election due on September 17th. Mr Netanyahu is currently defence minister as well as prime minister; successful strikes increase his popularity. His tactics are also causing unease in Washington, where sources in the Pentagon have briefed the media that Israel is behind the explosions in Iraq. The Americans fear this could destabilise the Iraqi government. Like Iran, Israel too may have overreached. The incident in Beirut is seen as a breach of the unofficial “red lines” with Hizbullah. Since the war of 2006, in which the two sides fought each other to a stalemate while Israel destroyed much of Lebanon’s civil infrastructure, they have not carried out offensive operations against each other on Lebanese territory. Hizbullah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has publicly warned Israel to “wait for our response which may take place at any time on the border and beyond the border”. Such talk is usually cheap in the Middle East, but Mr Nasrallah’s threats are taken seriously. Israel has closed roads and airspace on its northern border in anticipation of an attack. Still, neither side wants to see a major escalation. Hizbullah is not just an Iranian proxy but also a Lebanese political party with a stake in maintaining calm. Mr Netanyahu wants to preserve his tough image, but is anxious not to upset Israeli voters on the eve of elections. With luck, such calculations will work to contain a dramatic escalation of hostilities. But the conflict between Israel and Iran is widening. That is one more reason—on top of the need to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions—to hope that there is more to Mr Macron’s diplomatic efforts than G7 summit showmanship. ■"
https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead,"EMMANUEL MACRON, the French president, has warned European countries that they can no longer rely on America to defend NATO allies. “What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,” Mr Macron declares in a blunt interview with The Economist. Europe stands on “the edge of a precipice”, he says, and needs to start thinking of itself strategically as a geopolitical power; otherwise we will “no longer be in control of our destiny.” During the hour-long interview, conducted in his gilt-decorated office at the Elysée Palace in Paris on October 21st, the president argues that it is high time for Europe to “wake up”. He was asked whether he believed in the effectiveness of Article Five, the idea that if one NATO member is attacked all would come to its aid, which many analysts think underpins the alliance's deterrent effect. “I don't know,” he replies, “but what will Article Five mean tomorrow?” NATO, Mr Macron says, “only works if the guarantor of last resort functions as such. I’d argue that we should reassess the reality of what NATO is in the light of the commitment of the United States.” And America, in his view, shows signs of “turning its back on us,” as it demonstrated starkly with its unexpected troop withdrawal from north-eastern Syria last month, forsaking its Kurdish allies. In President Donald Trump, Europe is now dealing for the first time with an American president who “doesn’t share our idea of the European project”, Mr Macron says. This is happening when Europe is confronted by the rise of China and the authoritarian turn of regimes in Russia and Turkey. Moreover, Europe is being weakened from within by Brexit and political instability. This toxic mix was “unthinkable five years ago,” Mr Macron argues. “If we don’t wake up [...] there’s a considerable risk that in the long run we will disappear geopolitically, or at least that we will no longer be in control of our destiny. I believe that very deeply.” Mr Macron’s energetic recent diplomatic activity has drawn a great deal of interest abroad, and almost as much criticism. He has been accused of acting unilaterally (by blocking EU enlargement in the Western Balkans), and over-reaching (by trying to engineer direct talks between America and Iran). During the interview, however, the president is in a defiant but relaxed mood, sitting in shirt sleeves on the black leather sofa he has installed in the ornate salon doré, where Charles de Gaulle used to work. The French president pushes back against his critics, for instance arguing that it is “absurd” to open up the EU to new members before reforming accession procedures, although he adds that he is ready to reconsider if such conditions are met. Mr Macron’s underlying message is that Europe needs to start thinking and acting not only as an economic grouping, whose chief project is market expansion, but as a strategic power. That should start with regaining “military sovereignty”, and re-opening a dialogue with Russia despite suspicion from Poland and other countries that were once under Soviet domination. Failing to do so, Mr Macron says, would be a “huge mistake”.

https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/01/30/donald-trump-gives-israel-the-green-light-to-annex-occupied-lands,"FOR MONTHS they said the timing was simply wrong. Members of the Trump administration, led by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, worked for two years on a plan to solve the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, finishing last year. Then they waited for an opportune moment to release it. On January 28th that moment arrived. Never mind that Israel was headed for its third election in less than a year, with a prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, facing trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Or that, while Donald Trump unveiled the plan at the White House, senators at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue listened to arguments in his impeachment trial. Or that the Palestinians had not spoken to America in two years. The plan Mr Trump’s administration presented was unexpectedly detailed, with more than 50 pages of proposals and maps. But as a blueprint for a two-state solution it was dead on arrival. It would not give the Palestinians a sovereign state immediately; that might come only later, after they built a government that satisfied both Israel and America. They would retain only about 75% of the West Bank, divided into three cantons linked by highways; a tunnel would connect it to Gaza, and to two remote plots of land in the western Negev desert swapped in exchange for Israeli settlements, which would remain in place (see map). Israel would keep control of the Jordan valley and most of Jerusalem. The Palestinian capital would be established in a few grim neighbourhoods, such as Abu Dis and Shuafat, that sit on the other side of a hulking concrete separation barrier. No Palestinian refugees would be allowed to return to Israel, only to Palestine or unnamed Muslim countries that would accept up to 50,000 each. Israel would commit not to build new settlements in the land allocated for a future Palestine for four years; in return, though, it received an implicit American recognition of its claims to the rest of the West Bank. Mr Netanyahu declared that Mr Trump was “puncturing this big lie” that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were illegal. His cabinet may begin voting in early February to annex some of the American-allocated land. The Palestinians rejected the proposal outright. It will end up “in the dustbin of history”, says the president, Mahmoud Abbas. His reaction should be no surprise. There is much to criticise about the decrepit Mr Abbas, now in the 16th year of what was meant to be a four-year term. But no Palestinian leader could accept a deal that in effect cedes Jerusalem and relegates his people to further statelessness. Far from a good-faith effort to solve the conflict, Mr Trump’s plan was a sop to hawkish ideologues in Jerusalem and Washington. Perhaps it was never meant to be more. On March 2nd Israelis will go to the polls again. The previous two elections, in April and September, left Mr Netanyahu without a majority for his coalition of right-wing and religious parties. By presenting the plan now, so close to the vote, Mr Netanyahu’s American backers hope it will dominate the campaign and energise his Likud base. He seems to need the help: polls so far show a slow but continuing erosion of his support. Hours before the plan was unveiled, Israel’s attorney-general filed formal charges against the prime minister in a Jerusalem court. Over the next five weeks Mr Netanyahu will use the plan as his main platform (and a welcome distraction from his legal trouble). His allies are pushing for a swift vote on annexing parts of the West Bank. “What is postponed until after the election will never happen,” says the defence minister, Naftali Bennett. But legal concerns may slow the process: the cabinet plans to ask the attorney-general if an interim government can approve such a drastic step. (Mr Kushner hopes Israel waits until after the election.) The cabinet cannot vote on implementing the full Trump plan, because that calls for relinquishing territory, which under Israeli law requires a referendum. Regardless of the delays, mere talk of annexation could benefit Mr Netanyahu politically. His main challenger, Benny Gantz, ran on a vaguely centrist platform in the past two elections, absorbing parts of Israel’s “peace camp”. That won him a plurality of seats in September, but he too failed to form a coalition. In recent weeks he has moved sharply to the right, hoping to attract disgruntled Likud voters. Mr Gantz says he too would implement the Trump plan. Some members of his Blue and White party are more cautious. If they balk at annexation, Mr Netanyahu will paint them as weak and unpatriotic, liable to miss a “historic opportunity” that he likens to David Ben-Gurion’s decision in 1948 to declare Israel’s independence. The Palestinians see all this not as an opportunity but a disappointment, one both historic and predictable. For a time they were guardedly optimistic about Mr Trump. Despite his pro-Israel campaign rhetoric, some Palestinian officials hoped an unconventional president might take an unconventional approach to diplomacy. His special envoy at the time, Jason Greenblatt, held a well-received listening tour of the West Bank in 2017, meeting Palestinian leaders and ordinary citizens. But the relationship suffered a lasting rupture in December 2017, when Mr Trump broke decades of precedent and announced that he was moving America’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Palestinians claim part of Jerusalem as their future capital; most countries keep their embassies in Tel Aviv, arguing that to do otherwise would prejudge the status of the city. The following year Mr Trump closed the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington. He has also cut all American aid to the Palestinians. Relations have not been this bad since 1987, when America labelled the Palestine Liberation Organisation a terrorist group. Mr Kushner and his aides did not seem to mind; they came to view the Palestinians more as a nuisance than a negotiating partner. Their plan would impose immediate costs on the Palestinians, with the benefits (such as a proposed $28bn in aid, none of which has yet been pledged) coming years, perhaps decades, in the future. Instead they proposed an “outside-in” approach: encourage other Arab states to embrace the plan, then hope they would press the Palestinian leadership to accept it. This was always a far-fetched idea. Jordan has rejected the plan. The Gulf states, which have worked hard to court Mr Trump, will not want to anger him by publicly criticising it. Ambassadors from Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates attended its release (Saudi Arabia was notably absent). But they are unlikely to do much to promote a proposal that the Palestinians have so firmly rejected. On the eve of his inauguration, Mr Trump expressed almost preternatural confidence in his son-in-law, a property developer with no diplomatic experience. “If you can’t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,” he told Mr Kushner. Perhaps no one can. Mr Kushner is unlikely to bring peace, but his plan may still bring lasting change. If Israel annexes large parts of the West Bank, it will be all but impossible for the Palestinians to establish a viable state. The two-state solution, on which decades of American peacemaking had been built, has long been a fading dream; it would finally be buried. Mr Trump may yet go down in history, not for making a deal, but for making one impossible. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/12/16/the-israel-morocco-peace-deal-is-roiling-western-sahara,"ISRAEL’S FORMAL ties with the Arab world now extend from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the east to Morocco in the west. On December 10th President Donald Trump announced the latest breakthrough in his diplomatic push on behalf of the Jewish state. Morocco, the Arab world’s oldest monarchy, will become the fourth Arab state in as many months to establish diplomatic relations with Israel (following the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan). The agreement is a win for Israel, and also for Morocco. As part of the deal, Mr Trump recognised Morocco’s annexation of Western Sahara. The territory, slightly larger than Britain, is also claimed by the Polisario Front, a nationalist movement backed by Algeria. Mr Trump’s intervention comes amid provocations by both sides that risk restarting a war that ended three decades ago. That old conflict kicked off in 1975, when Morocco annexed Western Sahara after Spain, the colonial power, pulled out. Polisario, which the UN considers the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, resisted—but was outgunned. With Morocco in control of about two-thirds of the territory, and Polisario controlling the other third, the UN brokered a ceasefire deal in 1991 that promised the Sahrawis a referendum on independence. Morocco, though, stands in the way. Morocco’s treatment of the Sahrawis is in some ways like Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. Over the years Morocco has used subsidies and tax breaks to convince thousands of its people to move to Western Sahara in an effort to cement its control. Sahrawi protests are suppressed; activists talk of torture by the security services. But the kingdom has also spent billions of dollars fixing up the territory. Once of primarily symbolic value, Western Sahara’s strategic value has been growing. The side held by Polisario has little in the way of resources. But the portion controlled by Morocco is rich in phosphates and fish. Large reserves of oil may lie offshore. The kingdom also sees Western Sahara as its gateway to west Africa, which buys up Moroccan exports. So the kingdom is working hard to transform its de facto control of Western Sahara into something more legitimate. Over the past year it has convinced around 20 African and Arab states to recognise its claim. The UN seems to have all but given up on overseeing the referendum. A UN Security Council resolution in October extending the mandate of the UN’s peacekeeping mission did not mention the vote, though it is called the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara. “Morocco’s serious, credible and realistic autonomy proposal is the ONLY basis for a just and lasting solution for enduring peace and prosperity!” tweeted Mr Trump, referring to a proposal Polisario does not feel is serious or credible. “Morocco recognized the United States in 1777. It is thus fitting we recognize their sovereignty over the Western Sahara.” Indeed, both acts neglected the opinion of the indigenous population. President-elect Joe Biden could adopt a more even-handed approach. Inside Morocco, the king’s decision to normalise relations with Israel is controversial. Many Islamists and leftists oppose the move. But most Moroccans seem to consider America’s recognition of the kingdom’s claim over Western Sahara more important than the kingdom’s recognition of Israel. They have long called for putting their needs before those of the Palestinians. A popular slogan, “Taza before Gaza”, refers to cities in Morocco and Palestine. The Sahrawis pose a bigger risk. In October Sahrawi protesters closed the UN-patrolled border crossing at Guerguerat (see map). The area is meant to act as a buffer zone, but Morocco sent in troops to quell the unrest. That enraged Brahim Ghali, leader of Polisario. In November he abandoned the ceasefire and claimed a series of attacks around the 2,700km (1,700-mile) sand berm, built by the Moroccan army, that separates the two sides. Whether things escalate further depends, in part, on Algeria. It competes with Morocco for access to markets and may see a benefit in the trouble around Guerguerat. But Mr Trump’s deal has it worried. American and Israeli support, warn Algerian generals, might embolden Morocco at a time when Algeria is economically weak and politically unstable. Algeria’s prime minister, Abdelaziz Djerad, warns of a “real threat on our borders, reached by the Zionist entity”. Some of this may be an effort by Algerian leaders to divert attention from problems at home. But they have the backing of Russia, which criticised America for acting unilaterally on Western Sahara. The manoeuvring of local players and foreign powers is pushing the situation into dangerous territory. Whether or not Mr Trump’s deal lowers tensions in the Holy Land, it is raising them in the Sahara. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/05/21/how-fast-will-israels-new-government-proceed-with-annexation,"IT HAS BEEN six years since Israeli and Palestinian leaders last talked to each other. There is no end in sight to the decades-old confrontation between the two sides. But the outbreak of covid-19 has at least led to “inspiring examples” of co-operation, says Nickolay Mladenov, the UN’s envoy in the region. On May 19th, for example, Israel allowed a plane from the United Arab Emirates, with which it does not have formal relations, to deliver medical supplies to the Palestinians. Israel itself has trained Palestinian medics and ensured that testing kits and protective gear reach the occupied territories. It is also planning a loan for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which runs the West Bank. “The recognition of this interdependence could—if there is political will—translate into tangible progress towards resolving the conflict,” Mr Mladenov says hopefully. Yet a new government in Israel, sworn in on May 17th, may bring this period of co-operation to an end. After three elections and over a year of political deadlock, Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, reached a deal with his former rival, Benny Gantz, to share power. Mr Netanyahu will stay in the top job until November 2021, when Mr Gantz (currently the “alternate prime minister”) will take over. The big question is how will they proceed with annexation. Mr Netanyahu has promised to extend Israeli sovereignty over chunks of the West Bank that the Palestinians see as part of their future state. According to the coalition agreement, he can hold a vote on annexation in the cabinet or parliament any time after July 1st. America must also approve any move. Donald Trump, America’s president, gave Mr Netanyahu a push in January when his administration released a peace plan that would have Israel maintain control of all of Jerusalem and take parts of the West Bank, where Israel has dozens of settlements, and all of the Jordan Valley (see map). In his inaugural speech Mr Netanyahu sounded eager “to write a glorious new chapter in the history of Zionism”. But currently he is focused on restoring “jobs, jobs, jobs” to an economy hit hard by the virus—and fighting corruption charges in a trial that begins on May 24th. He has not specified a timetable for annexation, and when he spoke to his new ministers he didn’t list it as a priority. “It was a good election gimmick for Netanyahu to rally his base,” says a minister. “And it worked. But I don’t think he’s going to go through with it. Perhaps he’ll make do with a symbolic annexation of a couple of settlements.” Mr Netanyahu’s new partners are also sounding cautious. Gabi Ashkenazi, the foreign minister (and an ally of Mr Gantz), says the Trump plan is a “historic opportunity”, but that Israel will proceed “responsibly, in co-ordination with the United States, while safeguarding peace agreements and Israel’s strategic interests”. Mr Ashkenazi is concerned about Jordan, which is at peace with Israel and is home to millions of Palestinians. King Abdullah of Jordan worries that annexation would kill any hope of a two-state solution and stir up his own Palestinian subjects. Mr Netanyahu’s supporters want him to push ahead while Mr Trump is still in office. Lately, though, the White House, under pressure from Arab leaders, has sounded less gung-ho about annexation. When Mike Pompeo, America’s secretary of state, visited Israel on May 13th, he said Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz, a former army chief who opposes unilateral annexation, “will have to find the way forward together”. Israeli diplomats say the administration has asked Mr Netanyahu to put things on hold, for now. Some on the Israeli right hope that Mr Trump, who is up for re-election in November, may yet push for annexation in order to win over evangelicals and right-wing Jewish voters. The Palestinians, for their part, are outraged. Mahmoud Abbas, their president, says the annexation clause in the Israeli coalition deal means the PA is no longer bound by its agreements with Israel. He has made such statements before, but never followed through by, for example, ending security co-operation. Joint action against the outbreak continues. The death rate from covid-19 has been low on both sides. “I can work with my Israeli colleagues against the coronavirus for the health of my people,” says a Palestinian doctor. “It doesn’t change the ugly reality of occupation.” ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/08/20/the-israel-uae-deal-is-good-news-for-a-troubled-region,"IT WAS NOT only Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestinians, who watched with “grief and fury” as Anwar Sadat went to Israel in 1977. Several of the region’s autocrats severed ties with Egypt’s president over what some called a “treasonous” act. When, two years later, Sadat signed a peace deal with the Jewish state, they erupted in outrage again. Egypt was suspended from the Arab League, which imposed a boycott on the country and left Cairo for Tunis. In 1981 Sadat was murdered by jihadists who cited the peace deal as one of their main grievances. In many ways the region looks the same as it did four decades ago. Autocracy is still in vogue; the Palestinians remain stateless. But relations between Israel and the rest of the Arab world are unrecognisable. When the United Arab Emirates (UAE) agreed to establish diplomatic ties with the Jewish state on August 13th, there was little grief or fury in the region’s capitals. Israel’s first formal relationship with a Gulf state, and its third with any Arab country (Egypt and Jordan being the others), was met with praise from many Arab leaders (see article). Some are calling it a “breakthrough”, others a “turning-point for peace”. But the deal is not remarkable for how it might transform the region. Rather, it reflects remarkable changes that have already taken place. A part of the world once defined by Arab-Israeli hostilities is no longer so; countries increasingly look towards the future, not the past, when shaping their policies. In a perennially troubled neighbourhood, this decline in tension is worth celebrating, even if other dangerous fault-lines remain. It was no secret that Israel and the Gulf states had grown closer of late. Motivated by a common enemy, Iran, their armies and spy agencies swap intelligence. Recently, Israeli officials began popping up in Gulf capitals. But the UAE’s decision to take its relationship public will bring more benefits for both sides. Israeli business people are excited about their access to Dubai, the region’s financial hub—which happens to be in dire need of a clean-up (see article). Deals have already been signed between Israeli and Emirati firms. It feels like a much warmer peace than that between Israel and Egypt. Other Arab states are talking about following the UAE’s lead. Give the Trump administration due credit. Seven months ago it unveiled a peace plan that was immediately rejected by the Palestinians and most Arab states, because it allowed Israel to annex about 30% of the occupied West Bank and gave the Palestinians something less than a state in return. But at the same time America was sponsoring secret talks between Israel and the UAE. Somehow, in a feat of diplomatic alchemy, American officials turned this far-fetched scheme into leverage. The UAE demanded no real concessions from Israel, other than a promise from Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, that he would not move ahead with annexation at the moment. The deal is a boon for Mr Netanyahu, who has been under fire at home over allegations of corruption and for his poor handling of covid-19. The prime minister claims there is “no change” to his pledge to annex parts of the West Bank. In reality, the deal lets him duck a tricky issue. His nationalist allies have wanted him to absorb Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, even though it would have brought international opprobrium. He has avoided that choice and, nonetheless, thrown the nationalists a bone. They have always rejected the idea of swapping land for peace, long the framework of talks with the Arabs. Peace for peace should suffice, they argued. Now, apparently, it does. The big losers, as ever, are the Palestinians. Only three years ago the Arab states re-endorsed a strategy of offering normal relations with Israel in return for its withdrawal from the occupied territories and the establishment of a Palestinian state, among other things. But Arab rulers, particularly in the Gulf, have grown increasingly frustrated with the stale and stubborn Palestinian leadership. Perhaps exposing the charade of pan-Arab solidarity, and separating the Israeli-Arab conflict from the Israeli-Palestinian one, will lead to a more honest assessment of what is possible. For the time being, though, a just solution to the Palestinian plight feels as elusive as ever. And what of those other fault-lines? The most dangerous lies between, on one side, America, Israel and much of the Arab world, and, on the other, Iran. Its economy is on the brink of collapse, while its proxy in Lebanon, Hizbullah, faces a backlash over a deadly explosion in Beirut. The Israel-UAE deal, as much as it reflects their shared antagonism to Iran, adds a new element to President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign. Where that campaign will ultimately lead remains an open question. But officials in America and the Middle East would do well to remember that bitter enemies need not always remain so. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/02/27/a-growing-number-of-jews-are-voting-for-arabs-in-israel,"THE AUDIENCE in Kfar Saba, a Jewish city near Tel Aviv, came from as far away as the Golan Heights in the north and Beersheva in the south. They crowded onto the terrace of a packed penthouse to hear a politician who promised to stop missiles from Gaza and counter hatred of Jews. With the crowd’s support, the politician continued, he could achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians via a two-state solution. None of that would have been unusual, except that the politician was Ayman Odeh (pictured), a jovial lawyer who heads the Joint List, a bloc of Arab-Israeli parties. After decades representing insular parties on the periphery of Israeli politics, Arab politicians have entered the mainstream. The Joint List is the country’s third largest bloc. It is courting the Jewish vote ahead of parliamentary elections on March 2nd. It has removed more pugnacious candidates and sees a place for itself in a centre-left government. Balad, the bloc’s most radical party, has put a Jew (of Iranian origin) on its list of candidates. The Joint List’s billboard campaign has an inclusive message. Posters in Yiddish promise ultra-orthodox Jews an end to conscription. Amharic ones vow to tackle police brutality against Ethiopians. “Let’s go together,” read the Hebrew ones. The outreach seems to be working. In the election last September the Joint List increased its support in Jewish areas by 60% compared with the election in April, albeit from a very low base. Dahlia Scheindlin, a pollster, predicts it could increase again, perhaps giving the Joint List an extra seat (it currently has 13). Jews attending a packed hustings in Tel Aviv spoke of abandoning Meretz, a left-wing Zionist party that has pushed Arab candidates down its list. Right-wing fearmongering against the Arab “enemy within” is attracting Jewish sympathy. A settler in a skullcap said he feared he would be branded a traitor if his neighbours found out he was attending an event for the Joint List. Mr Odeh says it is not so hard to imagine an Arab-Israeli prime minister. But his appeal has its limits. Two-thirds of Israeli Jews want to bar Arab parties from government. Over 40% oppose living next to an Arab, let alone voting for one. Yuppies flinch at the Joint List’s communist origins. Left-wing secular Jews are turned off by its Arab nationalist and Islamist cheerleaders. And the Joint List is bad at practising the equality it preaches. Just one of its 13 parliamentarians is Jewish. Still, the interest Mr Odeh is piquing indicates a growing demand for a party that truly spans Israel’s Jewish-Arab divide. Voters will have to wait a bit longer for that."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/03/05/binyamin-netanyahus-party-has-come-out-on-top-in-israels-election,"NEVER COUNT out Binyamin Netanyahu. For the past three decades that has been the cardinal rule of Israeli politics. And it was reinforced on March 2nd, when the 70-year-old prime minister pulled off another electoral feat. Mr Netanyahu’s party, Likud, has won the most seats (36) in Israel’s parliamentary election—the third in less than a year. But his coalition of nationalist and religious parties is three seats short of a majority in the 120-member Knesset (parliament). The previous two ballots, in April and September last year, failed to produce a government. There is no guarantee that this one will either. But Mr Netanyahu has momentum. When Likud was overtaken by Blue and White, its main rival, as the largest party in September, some wrote Mr Netanyahu’s political obituary. More earth was shovelled into his grave when, in November, the attorney-general indicted him for bribery and fraud. Mr Netanyahu, though, hung on, denying any wrongdoing. In December he soundly defeated a challenge to his leadership of Likud. Then he launched a blistering re-election campaign. Already Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Mr Netanyahu had plenty to brag about on the stump. He has kept Israel secure, improved ties to Arab states and overseen a growing economy. What is more, President Donald Trump has given him a succession of political gifts: the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the isolation of the Palestinian Authority and, most recently, a peace plan that gives Mr Netanyahu almost everything he wants. Yet the prime minister’s campaign was defined by its dirtiness. Mr Netanyahu questioned the mental health of Benny Gantz, Blue and White’s leader and a former military chief of staff (appointed by Mr Netanyahu). He even suggested that Mr Gantz had been blackmailed by the Iranians. Mr Netanyahu’s son, Yair, tweeted about alleged infidelity by Mr Gantz. As President Reuven Rivlin, a Likud member, cast his ballot, he lamented that the campaign had declined “to the point of filth”. But Mr Netanyahu also relied on data to target micro-constituencies, such as immigrants, cab drivers and airline employees. He bombarded each with promises, such as telling cannabis-users that he would decriminalise the recreational use of the drug, and delaying a measure that would make taxi fares more transparent. Mr Gantz’s strategy was to appeal to “soft-right” voters fed up with Mr Netanyahu’s alleged corruption. But this made the party almost indistinguishable from Likud, and many voters stuck to the original. Blue and White won 33 seats, as in September. Left-wing parties suffered. The coalition of Labour, Gesher and Meretz won just seven seats, down from 11 in September. Some of its former voters supported the Joint List, an alliance of predominately Arab parties, which got 15. The parties that oppose Mr Netanyahu won a small majority, but are divided. Right-wing members of Blue and White and the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party refuse to work with the Joint List. So Mr Netanyahu will probably be given the first chance to form a government. If so, the Supreme Court might intervene. It will undoubtedly be asked to decide whether Mr Rivlin can legally invite someone under criminal indictment to assemble a coalition. Senior members of the opposition are also talking about changing the law in order to ban an indicted politician from forming a government. “Gantz is trying to steal the election,” says Mr Netanyahu. Even if he is given the green light, Mr Netanyahu has work to do. His coalition won 58 seats, so he needs to peel off three opposition members to get a majority. Alternatively he could cut a deal with Blue and White. During the campaign Mr Gantz ruled out serving under an indicted prime minister. But his poor result might soften his stand. On election night he insisted only that the allegations against Mr Netanyahu be heard in court. The prime minister’s trial is due to begin on March 17th (though some in his coalition still hope to grant him retroactive immunity). The outcome also raises the question of annexation. Mr Netanyahu has promised to proceed with Mr Trump’s peace plan, which allows Israel to apply sovereignty to large parts of the occupied West Bank, including the Jordan Valley. The prime minister has been working with the Americans on how to move forward. He may feel that action needs to be taken before Mr Trump might have to vacate the White House. And becoming the man who brought more of the promised land under full Israeli control would make for an excellent campaign slogan in case a fourth election is required to break the deadlock. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/08/20/the-arab-countries-most-likely-to-recognise-israel,"“NOW THAT the ice has been broken, I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates’ lead,” said President Donald Trump on August 13th, when the UAE became just the third Arab state (after Egypt and Jordan) to establish formal ties with Israel. The move was greeted with approval by several of the region’s leaders, who have long had secret dealings with the Jewish state. So who will be next to bring them into the open? A good bet is Oman, which congratulated Israel and the UAE on their agreement. In the past Oman has played the role of interlocutor between Israel and the Arab world. In 2018 the late Sultan Qaboos hosted Binyamin Netanyahu, the first visit by an Israeli prime minister to the Gulf in over two decades (pictured). But in January a new sultan, Haitham bin Tariq, took over. He dismissed the foreign minister on August 18th, a day after the top diplomat spoke to his Israeli counterpart. The move came as part of a larger government shake-up, but Sultan Haitham may not yet feel secure enough to take such a bold step. If Oman doesn’t go next, perhaps Bahrain will. Its cabinet praised the “historic” Israel-UAE deal. Its prime minister has reportedly talked to the chief of Israel’s spy agency. And it has hosted Israeli officials before. American diplomats unveiled the economic half of Mr Trump’s Middle East peace plan in Bahrain’s capital, Manama, last year. The tiny kingdom is close to the UAE and, like Israel, it views Iran as a threat. Some point to Sudan as a strong possibility. Its interim leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, met Mr Netanyahu this year in Uganda, where they agreed to start normalising ties. Lately, though, Sudan has sent mixed messages. On the other side of Africa, Morocco is a decent bet too. It has played a leading role in previous Arab peace initiatives with Israel and was once a hub of Jewish life. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis hail from the north African state. Nearby Mauritania is another contender. It had formal ties with Israel from 1999 to 2009, but broke them off because of war over Gaza. Still, it praised the UAE’s “good judgment”. A long shot is Saudi Arabia. Muhammad bin Salman, the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, has said that formal relations could be mutually beneficial. He seems envious of Israel’s economic and technological might. The two countries already co-operate to counter Iran. But formal ties are probably still a step too far for the conservative kingdom. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/09/11/bahrain-joins-the-uae-in-recognising-israel,"IT TOOK 72 years for the first Gulf state to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. The second needed just four weeks. On September 11th President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that Bahrain would recognise Israel. Less than a month earlier, on August 13th, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reached a similar agreement with the Jewish state. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Abdullah bin Zayed, the Emirati foreign minister, had been due at the White House on September 15th for an official ceremony. The foreign minister of Bahrain will now join them. If the UAE’s decision came as a surprise, Bahrain’s was more predictable. Indeed, many observers had thought it would be the first Gulf state to recognise Israel. Their foreign ministers met publicly in Washington last year. Both countries regard Iran as a serious threat. Bahrain also sees ties with Israel as a way to boost its standing in Washington. The island kingdom relies on America for security (and hosts America’s Fifth Fleet). Even if it was expected, Bahrain’s announcement may prove more intriguing. The UAE did not have to worry about whether its decision would be popular: there is little space for dissent in the Emirates. Bahrain, on the other hand, has a history of protest. The Shia majority has long complained of discrimination at the hands of the Sunni royal family. Unrest peaked in 2011 during weeks of protests inspired by the Arab spring, which were crushed with the help of troops from other Gulf countries. Critics of normalisation with Israel have more room to express dissent in Bahrain—though they still face a ruthless state if they do. Another question is whether Bahrain serves as a trial balloon for its larger neighbour, Saudi Arabia. Bahrain relies heavily on Saudi Arabia for political and economic support. Saudi tourists are a mainstay of the Bahraini economy; most of Bahrain’s oil revenue comes from a joint offshore field operated by Saudi Aramco. Bahrain would not have made such a big move without Saudi Arabia’s blessing. The Saudis are unlikely to follow suit, at least so long as King Salman is alive. But he is 84 and in ill health. Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince, is far less attached to the old Arab orthodoxy about Israel. As for the Palestinians, they are once again frustrated, though hardly surprised. In January, when Mr Trump unveiled a Middle East peace plan they saw as unfair—it allowed Israel to annex almost one-third of the occupied West Bank—Bahrain’s ambassador was in the audience. Last year the kingdom hosted a conference organised by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser, where attendees discussed fanciful plans to invest in the economy of a future Palestinian state. The Palestinians boycotted the event. In a region where diplomacy can move at a glacial pace, the past few weeks seem dizzying. Israeli tourists will soon descend on luxury hotels and beaches in Dubai and Manama. Israeli airliners can now overfly the Arabian peninsula instead of taking an hours-long detour around it. In the Palestinian territories, though, not much has changed. A half-century occupation continues. Gaza remains a miserable open-air prison. Israel suddenly finds itself more accepted in the region—but it is no closer to resolving the conflict on its doorstep."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/01/04/israels-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-leads-the-world,"LESS THAN three weeks after Israel launched its covid-19 vaccination drive, more than 1.2m of its citizens, about 14% of the population, have received the first of two jabs. It is far ahead of the rest of the world. Bahrain, which comes second in terms of vaccination per person, has jabbed less than 4% of its population. By January 9th Israel hopes to have vaccinated nearly 2m people: two-thirds of those over 60, and most of the country’s medical staff. At that point they will all be called back for their second jab. Israel’s needlework is impressive. It also has some unique advantages. Start with the fact that its 9m citizens are spread over just 21,000 sq km (not including the occupied territories). So the logistics are relatively straightforward, even for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which needs to be kept ultracold during transit. Doses can be ferried from the main storage facility near Tel Aviv to vaccination centres across the county in a matter of hours. The unique structure of Israel’s health system also helps. The government provides universal coverage through four official health-insurance organisations, which are required to accept any citizen. Their funding is determined by how many members they have, so they compete to attract them. That makes the organisations reluctant to cut back on services. In order to hold costs down, they have invested heavily in digitisation and preventative medicine, with the goal of keeping members from needing expensive treatments. In other words, they are well suited to delivering the vaccine quickly and efficiently, and incentivised to get the jabs done sooner than the competition.  Israel’s small population makes its job easier. It also reportedly paid far more than the normal price for an early consignment of 4m doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, reasons that the extra cost of procuring the jabs will be outweighed by the economic benefit of lifting covid-related restrictions sooner. (Israel is currently in its third national lockdown.) For Mr Netanyahu, there are political considerations, too. Israel will hold an election on March 23rd and he faces formidable competition.  Several difficulties remain in dealing with covid-19. By early February the original shipment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will have been exhausted. At that time Israel hopes to begin vaccinating adults under 60. It has signed contracts with other big vaccine manufacturers, such as Moderna and AstraZeneca, but it is not clear if it will be able to continue at its rapid pace.  Meanwhile, other aspects of Israel’s effort to stem the virus remain a shambles. People are increasingly ignoring the government’s restrictions; infection rates are shooting up. “With most of the high-risk elderly population vaccinated by the end of the week, the transition-rate between new infections and serious cases in hospitals could be cut by over half,” says Ran Balicer, an epidemiologist advising the government. “But if the lockdown is unsuccessful and the rate of infections continues to rise, hospitals will remain crowded.” Then there is the question of what to do about the Palestinians. Those who are citizens of Israel or who live in East Jerusalem will have the same access to the vaccine as the Jewish citizens of Israel. But in the occupied territories vaccinations have yet to begin. According to the Oslo accords the health care of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza is the responsibility of the autonomous Palestinian Authority, which is planning its own vaccination programme (and is ill-equipped to carry it out). Still, as Israeli settlers in the West Bank are jabbed, while their Palestinian neighbours continue to suffer, Israel will face pressure to share."
https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/25/emirati-and-israeli-bosses-cannot-wait-to-do-business,"ISRAEL AND the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have maintained unofficial relations for a while, despite a half-century boycott in much of the Arab world of the Jewish state in its midst. So, too, with commercial ties. Goods moved between the two economies, but only by passing through intermediaries in third countries first. This made sense for high-margin products like technology, an Israeli forte, or diamonds, where the rigmarole could tack on a week’s delay and a surcharge of 1% for extra bank fees and insurance. Trade was pointless for most other businesses. No longer. On January 24th Israel opened an embassy in Abu Dhabi, the UAE’s capital, as part of the Abraham accords, a diplomatic deal brokered by America and signed in September. The outpost has symbolic value. It is also a beachhead for Israeli and Emirati bosses and investors keen on doing business. And there is plenty of business to be done “now that the relations between the two countries have come out into the open”, says David Meidan, a former senior spy at Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, who advises Israeli companies operating in the Arab world. Boosters talk of up to $6.5bn in annual bilateral trade—equivalent to 5% of Israel’s current total and 1% of the UAE’s—within a few years, and billions in investments. In the past six months Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy, has been pitching deals with its Israeli clients to Emirati firms in industries from carmaking to food. Until November, half rejected the advances out of hand. Now only a third do, says Subhash Joshi, head of Frost & Sullivan’s Middle Eastern practice in Dubai. He expects the share to keep falling. On February 7th-8th Abu Dhabi will host a high-profile UAE-Israel investment summit. A commercial love-in is in the air. Two port operators, Israel Shipyards and Dubai’s DP World, are planning a joint bid for Israel’s newly privatised Haifa Port. The Barakat Group, the UAE’s largest fresh-produce importer, is offering Israeli fare to the Emirati hotels and markets it supplies. Its managing director, Kenneth D’Costa, praises Israeli avocados, which he expects to take market share from pricier European fruit and poorer-quality Kenyan ones. That is just the start. Spending by Emirati farmers on Israeli agricultural kit, seeds and know-how (responsible for those avocados) is expected to balloon, as the UAE tries to decrease its reliance on foreign food, which makes up 80% of Emirati diets. Israel, for its part, will gain access to Emirati oil and gas, petrochemicals, building materials and other bulky goods, where thin margins made circuitous channels unprofitable. A recent study by the chambers of commerce of Dubai and Israel identified “potential” for Emirati exports of cement, ceramics and metals, which Israel now gets from farther afield at higher cost. Direct travel between the two countries will also boost business. Before the latest covid-19 lockdown as many as 25 flights a week ferried travellers between Tel Aviv and Dubai. There were none before the accords. In December alone more than 40,000 Israelis flew to Dubai. Israeli-passport holders are at last able to get on the ground in the UAE to drum up investment for Israel’s tech-startup scene, says Sharon Daniel, a venture capitalist in Tel Aviv. The Emiratis understand the Arab region “much better than we do”, says Erel Margalit of Jerusalem Venture Partners, a big venture-capital firm. They are also a gateway to the Far East, he adds. Asaf Azulay, marketing chief of Bank Hapoalim, a big Israeli lender, likewise spies “a double opportunity”: to gain access to the Arab world and Africa, and to invest jointly. His company has already signed co-operation agreements with two Emirati banks. Dan Catarivas of the Manufacturers’ Association of Israel expects unfettered business travel to boost trade in sensitive areas like security software and advanced equipment for health care, defence and energy production. It makes sense for the two most technologically advanced countries in the Middle East to “work together as hubs and research centres”, says Yoaz Hendel, who until recently served as Israel’s communication minister. It isn’t all plain sailing. Emiratis, taught to view Israel as evil, need time “to absorb this new reality”, says the boss of a big Emirati food importer. He has decided to steer clear of Israeli suppliers for now. After decades of animosity, some friction is inevitable. But signs of warming relations abound—literally in the case of Hebrew script popping up on Dubai streets. Jews walk about in religious garb. It is “almost like everything Judaism became trendy”, says an Emirati official. And for Israelis willing to move domicile, adds Mr Meidan, there is the added bonus of doing business in a country with no income tax. ■"
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2021/09/17/naftali-bennett-on-why-israel-is-giving-booster-jabs-for-covid-19,"AS THE WORLD combats covid-19, vaccines are critical. But should people in developed countries receive booster doses, especially before others in poor ones have received their first jab? Many countries are grappling with these questions, in particular America, Britain and those in Europe. The experience of Israel may be instructive. In July my government decided to administer a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to the Israeli public. It was a tough decision. Israel began vaccinating last December, after America and Britain had given the vaccine emergency approval. Yet there was no regulatory approval for the safety or efficacy of a third dose. And the World Health Organisation urges countries not to go ahead with boosters before less-developed countries have vaccinated a majority of their populations with a first dose.  Israel has world-class medical-research institutions, but for a small country to take the lead on this is another matter. The medical committee advising our government was divided. The easier course would have been to wait for a consensus to form among the experts. But public-health experts tend to be conservative and risk-averse—traits that serve us all well during normal times but may handicap and slow decision-making during a pandemic.  A pandemic is not solely a health issue. It has a huge impact on many fields: the economy, education, public communications, logistics and supply chains, psychology and mental health—the ties that bind individuals, families, communities and entire nations. Fighting a pandemic is like fighting a war, where the strategic decisions must not be made by the experts, the generals, but by the elected government, taking into account a broader picture.  Like war, a pandemic is fraught with uncertainty, partial information, rapid change and the need to make quick decisions and take decisive action. Sometimes, not making risky decisions can be more damaging than taking a calculated risk. Taking those risks is the responsibility of elected leaders.  When my government took office in mid-June, there was a feeling in Israel that we had defeated the coronavirus and the days of the pandemic were over for good. Israel’s early take-up of the vaccines started curbing the devastating third wave of covid-19 in February, allowing us to start emerging from lockdown. Face masks were removed with much fanfare, social-distancing restrictions and travel limitations were lifted. Life was back to normal. Or so we thought.  Starting in April, the Delta variant arrived in Israel and by July, the daily number of covid-19 cases, which had gone down to a mere handful in May, began rising rapidly, with hospitalisations following suit. The most worrying aspect was that many of those infected were vaccinated. We tried to understand what had happened. Was the Delta variant so virulent that it was capable of overcoming the vaccine’s defences or was it simply a matter of the waning of the vaccine’s effect over time?  After repeated meetings with immunologists and examining the data, we soon reached the conclusion that it was a combination of both factors. The high proportion of Israelis who had had their two doses early in the vaccination campaign were also more vulnerable to the new strain when their defences started to weaken. It was a classic case of “breakthrough” infections—when fully vaccinated people get infected.  Paradoxically, people with two doses can be at increased risk, because they think and act as if they’re fully protected, even when that protection may be waning. We knew that the vaccines worked and their side-effects were minor; we had seen that very clearly back in February. But their effectiveness over time and against new variants such as Delta was less clear.  There was another reason for the experts’ reluctance to endorse booster shots. The third wave had been overcome through a combination of the vaccine and lockdown restrictions. Some experts thought we couldn’t rely only on vaccines and needed to prepare for another lockdown.  As prime minister, I had two options: either drag Israel into yet another set of lockdowns and further harm our economy and society, or to double down on vaccines as the central strategy, together with less restrictive measures such as a face-mask mandate in closed spaces and the “Green Pass” scheme that requires people to carry proof of being vaccinated or negative test results in order to participate in various activities.  Besides avoiding the debilitating damage of another lockdown, there was a further reason for going ahead with the booster doses. As the Delta wave was rising, we had more cases among vaccinated people than among people who hadn't received a jab. When twice-dosed people are infected and fall ill, it erodes the public’s trust in the vaccines and discourages others from getting vaccinated. This is why, when many experts advised us that we should focus on the small proportion of non-vaccinated people before delivering boosters, we decided the third jabs were necessary to safeguard the public’s confidence in the vaccines.  It was to be the first time that we didn't shut down businesses, schools and public events in the face of a sharp rise in cases. It was a calculated risk. But thanks to the 3m Israelis who rushed to get their third vaccine, we have started seeing a decline in the number of infections and hospitalisations. This decline is so far taking place despite our decision to reopen schools on September 1st and to allow public gatherings to take place during the Jewish high holidays this month.  The large number of booster jabs has allowed researchers to observe in real time the effectiveness of the vaccine after a third dose. The studies so far show that the third dose is sufficient to boost resistance back to the level after the first two. Waiting too long to administer third doses risks squandering gains already made through vaccination and eroding valuable public trust. Israel’s experience shows that timely booster jabs can counter the next wave of infections.  These are lessons which are crucial not only for Israel, but for many countries. Initial success at covid-19 vaccination does not guarantee full immunity from subsequent waves and new variants. Levels of protection need to be monitored and, over time, boosted. The third booster vaccine has proven itself successful against the Delta variant.  According to a recent study, the third dose reduced the risk of those vaccinated and over 60 from developing severe cases of covid-19 by 90% compared with those who only had two doses. If we had waited just three more weeks before starting to administer them, Israel’s medical centres would have been overwhelmed by the number of severely ill. Acting quickly raised levels of immunity and saved lives in Israel, and it can save lives in other countries too. We have shared our data with other countries and included these among other recommendations.  As to the question of whether third doses can be justified when many in developing countries have yet to receive their first, we believe that it’s crucial to do what we can to save lives in our own countries, while working together as a global community to help developing countries fight the virus. Global production of vaccines has to keep growing in order to satisfy the needs of all nations; the pandemic knows no borders. But as global supply is steadily increasing, we have to acknowledge that availability of vaccines is not the only concern. We are constantly learning how best to use the vaccines against an evolving threat and it is crucial that the gains already made are not squandered with the consequent loss of public trust in vaccines.  There are those trying to publicly undermine the necessity and success of vaccinations. If we allow the defences of those who did the right thing and got vaccinated early to wane, just when new waves of infection are on the rise, we will not only be exposing them to danger, but providing fodder for the anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. That is why it remains crucial that countries that had early and efficient vaccine roll-outs are able to deploy boosters, so the vaccines can both continue to work and be seen to be working.  Scientific ingenuity and innovation provided a vaccine to the coronavirus with unprecedented speed. But we need to remain both vigilant and flexible to make sure we use it to its best possible effect. We believe we are proving that right now in Israel with the timely booster jabs and that other countries will follow suit. ■ __________ Naftali Bennett is the prime minister of Israel."
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/02/03/israels-vaccine-programme-gives-hope-to-the-world,"OVER ONE-THIRD of Israel’s population has received a vaccination against covid-19 since December 19th. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has campaigned heavily for vaccinations, personally lobbying the boss of Pfizer, an American drugmaker, to secure early shipments of its vaccine. He was the first Israeli to be jabbed, live on television. He promised that “Israel will be the first country in the world” to emerge from the pandemic—by the end of March. (Conveniently, this is when Israel will be holding a parliamentary election and Mr Netanyahu believes success will boost his Likud party.) This was a bold claim considering nobody was sure that vaccines would successfully lower infection rates by enough to lift lockdown restrictions. There is now evidence that the vaccination programme is having an impact. Analysis from Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, and his colleagues, has found that covid-19 cases are falling appreciably among old people in Israel. The effect is especially pronounced in hospital admissions: among people aged over 60 severe hospital cases have fallen by 26% since their peak on January 19th (see chart). In contrast, among those between 40 and 59—a group further back in the queue to be vaccinated—such severe cases have increased by 13%. The vaccination programme, rather than the national lockdown enacted a week later (and strengthened on January 5th), is the likeliest cause. As Israel’s vaccination programme progresses down the generations, cases and hospitalisations are expected to fall further across the board. Even though Israel has been giving out doses to nearly 2% of its population every day for the past fortnight, on average, there remains some way to go: 65% of people over 60 have received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine; less than one-third of 30-year-olds have received their first. Despite the encouraging falls in cases and hospital admissions attributed to vaccinations, political factors have hampered progress in other respects. Mr Netanyahu has been eager to highlight a diplomatic agreement he signed with the United Arab Emirates. Tens of thousands of Israelis flocked to Dubai for shopping holidays, and some returned with new, more infectious variants of covid-19. The government closed down its sole international airport on January 24th. And Palestinian authorities in the occupied West Bank and Gaza have barely started vaccinating their populations. The new variants have spread quickly, largely because they are harder to contain and partly because some people have flouted lockdown restrictions. Of particular concern are ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods (accounting for about 12% of Israel’s population), where schools and public gatherings have continued, and infection rates are double those of the rest of the country. One particularly controversial gathering was the mass funeral in Jerusalem of the 99-year-old Rabbi Meshulam Dovid Soloveitchik, attended by an estimated 20,000 ultra-Orthodox men on January 31st. Mr Netanyahu’s coalition relies on the support of ultra-Orthodox parties and he has been reluctant to enforce the lockdown on their supporters. Declining infections and hospital admissions will give hope to Mr Netanyahu, and the rest of the world. Where Israel has blazed a trail in its ability to distribute and administer vaccines quickly, other, bigger, countries are following. Britain and America have now given at least one dose to 14% and 8% of their populations respectively. In the coming weeks the magic of these vaccine programmes should slowly begin to reveal itself."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/05/14/israel-bombards-gaza-as-it-confronts-mob-violence-at-home,"FOR THE past four days, the world has anxiously watched Israel’s border with Gaza, where, on the Israeli side, infantry and armoured battalions have been massing. Palestinian militants in Gaza have launched hundreds of rockets at Israel, which has responded with hundreds of air strikes. Scores of people have already been killed, mostly Palestinians. Then, on May 14th, the Israeli army launched a big new attack on Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza. The offensive included dozens of air strikes and artillery barrages. Hamas then fired more rockets. “We will continue to do what we’re doing with great intensity,” said Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. “This operation will continue as long as necessary.” But Mr Netanyahu also has problems at home. In cities and towns across Israel, Arabs and Jews—all Israeli citizens with supposedly equal status—have clashed. Rioting and mob violence have left places such as Lod also looking like war zones: a line of burnt-out vehicles extended from the central marketplace to the city’s entrance. Israeli leaders warned of civil war. “There is no greater threat now than these riots,” said Mr Netanyahu a day before the Gaza offensive. Relations between Israel’s Jewish majority and its Palestinian citizens, who make up 20% of the population, have never been great. But the country has not seen unrest like this since 2000, when some Arab Israelis protested in solidarity with their kin under occupation in Gaza and the West Bank during the second intifada. Today the violence is widespread. In Acre a rampaging mob torched a hotel, restaurant and shops owned by Jews. On the roads in the Negev desert, Bedouins stoned Jewish drivers. In Jaffa, a 19-year-old soldier was beaten and his skull fractured by Arabs. But after two nights in which Arabs accounted for most of the violence, far-right Jewish thugs, football hooligans and settlers from the West Bank joined the fray. In Bat Yam, a suburb of Tel Aviv, they destroyed Arab-owned shops. A video shared widely on social media showed Jews pulling a man, presumed to be Arab, from his car and beating him. They kicked and punched him, even as he lay prone on the ground. In south-eastern Tel Aviv, neighbourhood Jewish vigilantes looking for Arab targets attacked reporters and police instead. The crisis began when Israeli police clashed with worshippers at the al-Aqsa mosque (Islam’s third-holiest shrine) in Jerusalem. But it is fuelled by the long-held grievances of Israel’s Arab minority. Though they are citizens and suffer fewer hardships and humiliations than Palestinians in the occupied territories, they are still not treated as equals to Jewish Israelis. For example, in 2018 the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) passed a law stating that the right of national self-determination is “unique to the Jewish people”. Israel’s non-Jewish citizens were excluded. In Lod, which has seen some of the worst violence, Jews and Arabs had long lived together without serious incident. But there were always problems, such as drugs and gangs, predominantly in Arab neighbourhoods. Some residents think the current situation stems from the police’s failure to confront intra-Arab violence in the past. “The police don’t even deal with the murders here among the Arabs,” says Khaled Sarsour, a resident. “Now everyone is worked up because Jews were attacked, but where were the police when Arabs killed Arabs? The protests are wrong, but they’re a result of neglect and discrimination. Al-Aqsa is just a small part of it.” In some areas the police are now successfully keeping Jews and Arabs apart. But things are still tense. A curfew and the arrival of 500 border police have not calmed Lod. During a visit to a police command post in the city on May 13th, Mr Netanyahu spoke of detaining people without trial. “You have our backing, don’t be afraid of commissions of inquiry,” he told officers. Soon after he left a Jewish medic was shot and wounded in yet another incident. The prime minister also talked of using the army in Lod. But it is already over-stretched. Israeli soldiers are not only tied down outside Gaza; they must also keep watch over the millions of Palestinians living in Jerusalem and the wider West Bank, which has remained relatively calm. And in the early hours of May 14th more rockets were fired at Israel—this time from Lebanon. Before all the trouble, Arab Israelis had been on the verge of a breakthrough that might have improved their lot. Jewish parties from across the political spectrum were in advanced talks with Ra’am, an Arab party, over forming a new government—one that would replace Mr Netanyahu. But the violence has put paid to those plans. Naftali Bennett, who was seen as a potential leader of that government, has reportedly resumed talking with Mr Netanyahu about a potential coalition. If the prime minister does hang on, he may have Palestinian militants to thank.

https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/03/31/to-unblock-israeli-politics-get-rid-of-binyamin-netanyahu,"BINYAMIN NETANYAHU is Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. He dominates political life. His loyal supporters praise his statesmanship, strength and skill. His critics condemn him for being divisive, domineering and dirty—he is currently on trial for corruption. Politics in Israel comes down to whether you are for or against the man known as Bibi. Voters, alas, cannot agree on someone to take his place, so gridlock has prevailed. Three elections in 2019 and 2020 failed to produce a stable government. A fourth, on March 23rd, seems to have ended in yet another stalemate. Several formidable rivals are trying to push Mr Netanyahu out. Although his party, Likud, won 30 seats in the 120-member Knesset, Israel’s parliament, fully 13 more than any other party, his desired coalition is nine seats short of a majority. But you should never rule out Bibi. He is stubborn and resourceful and there are still several ways he might hang on to power. It would be a shame if he did. Most Israelis want to see Mr Netanyahu go. A majority in the Knesset at least say they do, too. They range from doves to hawks, Arab Israelis to Jewish nationalists. At the moment they refuse to work together. Party leaders such as Yair Lapid, Benny Gantz, Gideon Sa’ar and Naftali Bennett all feel they should be the next prime minister. Each has flaws, but any would be better than Mr Netanyahu in the short term. It is time they set aside their egos, formed a new government and brought some fresh air into the stale fug that is Israeli politics. Give Mr Netanyahu credit: he has led a successful vaccination drive and forged closer ties with Arab states with the Abraham accords. Before the pandemic, he oversaw a flourishing economy. He is a remarkable politician and a deft diplomat. But in his determination to hold onto power come what may, he is damaging the democracy that makes Israel stand out in a region full of autocrats. The prime minister smears institutions, such as the police and the courts, in order to discredit the corruption case against him. Desperate to gain an electoral advantage, he has stooped to making common cause with Jewish supremacists. An anti-Bibi government would have plenty of drawbacks. It is unlikely, for example, to make progress with the Palestinians, who are due to hold their own elections this year. With many rival egos and philosophies, it would be unstable and probably short-lived. That has led some lawmakers to propose an alternative which does not require forming a government: to shut out Mr Netanyahu by closing the loophole that allows a person under indictment to become prime minister. In its favour, however, an anti-Bibi government can help kick-start the economy as the pandemic recedes by passing a new budget. The country has gone without one for over two years because of the gridlock, and only a government can get this done. What is more, an anti-Bibi coalition has many paths to power. Mr Bennett, for example, has been trying to steal the support of Mr Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox allies. The best solution would involve the Arab parties, which have never been invited into a coalition, nor shown much inclination to join one. Breaking that taboo—even if only by gaining their support from outside the government—would make it easier to form coalitions in the future and give Arab-Israelis, who make up a fifth of the population, a greater say in the country’s affairs. Even Mr Netanyahu, who once portrayed Arab parties as fifth columnists, has flirted with one of them, but his far-right allies object. Mr Sa’ar and Mr Bennett are equally reluctant, so forming an anti-Bibi government will be tricky. But talks have only just begun. There is time yet for Israeli politics to break the mould. ■"
https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/18/2022s-unlikely-economic-winners,"In financial terms the past year has been bad for almost everyone. Inflation of 10% year-on-year across the rich world has slashed household incomes. Investors have lost out as global stockmarkets have plunged by 20%. Yet this poor aggregate performance hides wide differences: some countries have done pretty well.  To assess these differences, The Economist has compiled data on five economic and financial indicators—gdp, inflation, inflation breadth, stockmarket performance and government debt—for 34 mostly rich countries. We have ranked each economy according to how well it has done on these measures, and created an overall score. The table at the end of this article shows the rankings. It includes some unexpected results.  For the first time in a while, the economic party is happening in the Mediterranean. Top of our list is Greece. Other countries that plumbed the economic depths in the early 2010s, including Portugal and Spain, also score highly. They are not the only pleasant surprises. Despite political chaos, Israel did well. Meanwhile, despite political stability, Germany is an underperformer. Two Baltic countries, Estonia and Latvia, which won plaudits in the 2010s for speedy reforms, come bottom.  gdp, usually the best measure of economic health, is our first indicator. Norway (helped by high oil prices) and Turkey (by a boom in sanctions-busting trade with Russia) have done better than most. The fallout from covid-19 also looms large. Thanks to strict lockdowns and a collapse in tourism, a year ago much of southern Europe was in dire straits, so the region was due a decent year. Visits to the Balearics recently rebounded beyond their pre-pandemic level. As your correspondent discovered on a recent trip to Ibiza, the island is so busy it is difficult to book a taxi or find a spot at a half-decent restaurant. Ireland probably had a strong year, though one not nearly as strong as gdp numbers suggest. The activities of big multinational companies, many registered there for tax purposes, have for years distorted the figures. By contrast, America’s gdp numbers are misleadingly weak: in recent quarters official statisticians have struggled to account for the impact of enormous stimulus packages.  More granular data fill in the picture. Our second measure is the change in the price level since the end of 2021. Away from the world’s attention, some countries have seen low inflation. In Switzerland consumer prices have risen by just 3%. The country’s central bank, helped along by a strong currency, responded rapidly to the rise in prices earlier this year. Countries which have non-Russian energy sources—such as Spain, which gets much of its gas from Algeria—have also done better than average. Those reliant on Vladimir Putin for fuel have truly suffered. In Latvia average consumer prices have risen by a fifth.  Our third measure also relates to inflation. It calculates the share of items in each country’s inflation basket where prices have risen by more than 2% in the past year. This provides an indication of how entrenched inflation is—and therefore hints at how quickly inflation will fall over the coming year. Some countries that suffer from high headline inflation have nonetheless been able to limit its breadth. In Italy, for instance, average consumer prices have risen by 11% this year, yet “only” two-thirds of its inflation basket has above-target inflation. Japanese inflation also looks like it may fade away. Britain is in more trouble. The price of every category in its basket is rising fast.  People’s sense of economic well-being does not just come from prices in the shops. They also look at the value of their pension pots and stock portfolios. In some countries it has been a terrible year for these sorts of investments. Share prices in both Germany and South Korea are down by nearly a fifth in 2022, double America’s decline. Swedish stocks have done even worse. Yet there are a few spots of strength. Norway’s stockmarket is up on the year. So is Britain’s, which is populated by the sort of dull, plodding companies that tend to be rewarded when economic times are tough. A fall in the value of the pound has also increased the value of foreign sales. Our final measure concerns the change in net government debt as a share of gdp. In the short run ministers are able to paper over economic cracks by increasing spending or cutting taxes. However this can create more debt and thus the need to turn the fiscal screws in the future. Some governments have spent extravagantly to cope with the cost-of-living squeeze. Germany has allocated funds worth about 7% of gdp to help with sky-high energy costs, meaning its debt-to-gdp ratio has risen. Other countries have pulled back from the splurge, helping to right the fiscal ship. Assisted by high inflation, public debt in southern European countries seems to be on the way down.  Will the gap between 2022’s winners and losers persist in 2023? Before long southern Europe’s economic growth, weighed down by rapidly ageing populations and high debts, will surely fall back to the region’s usual less-than-stellar levels. And there are hopeful signs that in countries such as America and Britain high inflation may finally be easing, which would help them up the rankings.  Along other dimensions, differences are likely to persist, not least when it comes to those countries reliant on Mr Putin for their energy supplies. Against the odds, many managed to replenish their stores of natural gas before winter set in—but only by paying outrageous prices. With supplies now largely cut off, the coming year will be a lot more difficult. That will be a big concern in the Baltics, but less so on the other side of Europe. It is hard to worry about gas supplies while eating a giant plate of squid on an Ibicencan beach. ■ For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/01/as-religious-schools-in-israel-grow-maths-is-neglected,"“There are two myths about Israeli education,” says Haim Shaked, head of Israel’s forum of teachers’ colleges. “One is that Jews care deeply about education. That may have been true when we were in exile and needed to retain our Jewish identity. In Israel that’s no longer the case. The second myth is that because Israel is such a tech success, with so many startups, this means that Israeli education is excellent. What we have are islands of excellence surrounded by a failing system.”  A report in October backed his gloomy prognosis. The number of trainee teachers had fallen by 38% compared with the previous year, as morale in the classroom plummeted. The government has raised teachers’ pay and made it easy to get into teacher-training college. But the number of teachers keeps falling. The profession lacks prestige. Bright young Israelis nowadays are keener to go into tech companies.  Indeed, over 10% of Israel’s workforce is employed in the tech industry, perhaps the world’s highest proportion, but some doubt this will last, since Israeli children are scoring dismally in international tests. “We’re getting serious complaints from business, academia and even the military about the level of school graduates,” says Dalit Stauber, the education ministry’s director-general. Israel’s education system faces “a strategic crisis”.  In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a test devised by the OECD and administered mostly to pupils in developed countries, Israel’s ranking for 15-year-olds has been steadily falling. By 2018 it was 29th out of 37 countries assessed, and even lower in maths (32nd) and science (33rd).  Dan Ben-David, an economist at the Shoresh Institute in Tel Aviv, has studied the results and found still more cause to worry. If the tests applied only to Israel’s secular schools, the country would be in the rich world’s top ten. But its state-run religious schools lag far behind, and those serving Israel’s Arabic-speaking minority do even worse (see chart). “Even these figures are misleading,” he observes. “They don’t include Jewish ultra-Orthodox schools, which don’t teach the national curriculum and aren’t tested by PISA.” “We’re constantly seeing the gaps widening among our applicants,” says Yuval Elbashan, Dean of the Ono College, Israel’s largest private academic institution, which has large numbers of Arab and ultra-Orthodox students. “We’re having to devote major resources just to getting new students up to standard.”  In 2020 a fifth of children started primary school in the ultra-Orthodox system. That proportion is set to grow, since the ultra-Orthodox have a high birth rate. Their political parties, which are part of the coalition that won Israel’s election on November 1st, have been promised by the incoming prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, that their schools will receive government funds, even though they ignore the national curriculum and generally refuse to teach “secular” subjects such as maths and English beyond a rudimentary level—and for boys only to the age of 12. After that, pupils are obliged to take exclusively religious lessons. Israel’s educational woes are not because of a lack of investment. National spending on primary and secondary education, at over 5% of GDP, is higher than in any other rich country. But its system of separate state-funded school networks for Jewish students of differing sects and for Muslim and Druze students requires a heavy and intrusive bureaucracy that hampers teachers and school heads. “Israel isn’t the only country with a shortage of teachers or wide social gaps,” says Adar Cohen of the Hebrew University’s School of Education. “But the way its state school system is split into different streams is unique—and a major source of its problems.” This division means that curriculums, tests and teachers’ training are conducted separately. The level of funding per student in state schools, whether Jewish or Arab, is equal. But richer local authorities supplement their local schools’ funding. Wealthy parents make up for what their children do not get at school. “Nearly everyone goes to state schools, but there’s an entire hidden industry of private tuition, paid for by parents who can afford it, which is holding up the Israeli economy,” says Yoav Pridan, principal of a Tel Aviv high school who co-chairs the Manhigim (“Leaders”) organisation of head teachers.  “The education ministers and director-generals are constantly changing and principals are unable to effect changes in their own schools, because we’re stuck with a politicised and centralised system,” says Mr Pridan. There have been seven education ministers in the past decade.  Ms Stauber, appointed by the outgoing government, has sought to reform teaching methods. She has given teachers incentives just to stay in the profession and granted heads more independence. She has also offered ultra-Orthodox schools extra funds if they agree to teach maths, science and English to a higher level. But she is about to leave after just a year in the job. A new minister from Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party is bound to try setting a different agenda. The outgoing team’s attempt at reform has provoked right-wing and religious criticism for supposedly forsaking traditional Bible studies. A new deputy minister representing the religious right will seek to ensure that ultra-Orthodox schools can carry on neglecting secular subjects such as maths and science. Meanwhile, the ultra-Orthodox are predicted to rise from around 12% of the population today to 25% by 2050. Without serious education reform, Israel could become a country where people know their Book of Numbers, but not their numbers or their books. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/21/mediterranean-gas-sends-sparks-flying-between-lebanon-and-israel,"In a region with no lack of eternal battlefields, the Mediterranean waters off the shores of Israel and Lebanon could become a new one. A row between the two countries over energy-exploration rights in a disputed triangle of the sea risks spiralling into war. Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hizbullah, the Iranian-backed Shia movement based in southern Lebanon, warned on August 9th that “any arm” reaching out to rob Lebanon of its wealth “will be cut off”. Mr Nasrallah has no official role in Lebanon’s government but is arguably the most powerful man in the country. Hizbullah’s military force is more powerful and sophisticated than the Lebanese army, with a punchy rocket arsenal and drones supplied mainly by Iran. In early July three of those drones were launched towards a gasfield known as Karish (Hebrew for shark), about 90km off Israel’s coast, partially inside the disputed area. A Greek-owned company, Energean, operating on an Israeli licence, is on the verge of tapping the field. Israeli missiles intercepted and dished the drones, but Mr Nasrallah’s message was clear. He is insisting that Israel must not begin extracting gas in September, as it had planned. Although Israel has been carrying out air strikes against Hizbullah’s weapons depots and convoys in Syria for over a decade, it has refrained from fighting on Lebanese territory since the end of a ferocious campaign against the militants there in 2006. Neither side wants to repeat that confrontation. Hizbullah managed to withstand Israel’s month-long onslaught and continued to fire missiles at Israeli towns, even though Israel’s air force clobbered Lebanon’s civilian infrastructure.  Lately, however, Hizbullah has been seeking to boost its credentials as a “resistance” organisation. “Hizbullah has lost a lot of its popularity in Lebanon and needs to regain legitimacy as an armed group,” says Tamir Hayman, a former commander of Israeli military intelligence who now runs the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. Iran, Hizbullah’s patron, also wants to keep Israel distracted from the latest negotiations to revive the nuclear agreement with America and five other world powers. Aware of this, America has been trying to broker a demarcation of the two countries’ exclusive economic zones in the sea. Lebanon’s caretaker government under Najib Mikati has called on Hizbullah to keep out of the dispute. But Israeli officials are worried that Hizbullah will be tempted to attack the gas-production platforms again. That could spark a wider conflagration. “Picking a fight with Israel over offshore exploration rights is a convenient way to claim that there is an ‘Israeli occupation’ of the sea and that Hizbullah’s rocket arsenals are justified. It doesn’t mean Hizbullah wants a war, but it could escalate into one,” says Mr Hayman. Both Israel and Egypt have been expanding their navies to defend their gasfields. The natural gas under the eastern Mediterranean could also help prop up the floundering economies of Lebanon and Egypt. Offshore gas could fund much-needed infrastructure projects for the Palestinians in Gaza. It has already served to bolster alliances between Israel, Egypt and Jordan, which now have a joint gas pipeline system. Saudi Arabia may be another beneficiary, since its futuristic city, Neom, is being built near the border with Jordan. Weaving Lebanon into the energy network in the eastern Mediterranean makes sense, but cannot happen as long as Lebanon has no official ties with Israel. The untapped reservoir of natural gas under the sea could also provide a fine alternative for European countries facing energy crises, as they struggle to wean themselves off Russian supplies. But few oil companies would risk conducting exploration work, building production platforms and laying down pipelines if the very process threatened to spark a conflagration. ■"
https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker,"AS THE VOTES from Israel’s fifth election in less than four years were finalised on November 3rd, one group in particular had cause to celebrate. The Religious Zionism list took 14 seats in the Knesset, up from six last year, making it the third-largest group. Many credit Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right nationalist politician, with boosting its popularity. He joined Religious Zionism as co-leader at the behest of Binyamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, to bolster support for Mr Netanyahu’s far-right bloc in parliament. His popularity has propelled Mr Netanyahu back to the top job⁠—and has pulled Israeli politics further to the right. Once on the fringe, Mr Ben-Gvir might now become a government minister. What does his rise to power mean for Israel? For years Mr Ben-Gvir was shunned by right-wingers as an extremist. Born in 1976 in Jerusalem to Iraqi Jewish immigrants, Mr Ben-Gvir joined Kach, an ultra-nationalist movement described by America as a terrorist organisation, at the age of 16. Kach was led by Meir Kahane, a violent anti-Arab nationalist who called for Arab Israelis to be stripped of their citizenship. In 1994 Baruch Goldstein, a fellow Kach adherent, killed 29 Palestinians in a mosque in the occupied West Bank; until he entered politics Mr Ben-Gvir hung a poster of Goldstein in his home. Mr Ben-Gvir made a name for himself in 1995, after being exempted from conscription to the Israel Defence Forces because of his extreme views, by threatening Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, on television, saying he would “get to him”. Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli ultra-nationalist three weeks later.  Mr Ben-Gvir qualified as a lawyer, specialising in representing Jews accused of extremism. In 2013 he joined the Knesset slate for Jewish Power, an ideological successor to Kach, and became its leader in 2019. Mr Ben-Gvir has called for “disloyal” Arabs to be expelled from Israel and has been filmed waving a gun in the faces of Palestinians protesting in East Jerusalem. He has been indicted more than 50 times (and convicted once) for inciting violence and hate speech. Yet only in the past year has his party had any weight in Israeli politics. In the election of March 2020 Jewish Power mustered just 0.42% of the vote, below the electoral threshold to gain a seat in the Knesset. But last year it joined the Religious Zionism list which, with the help of Mr Ben-Gvir’s voters, more than doubled its number of seats in this week’s election. A combination of rising violence and a flailing political system has created an opportunity for Mr Ben-Gvir to sell his views to a wider audience. Last year Mr Netanyahu courted Arab politicians and voters, alienating the right. Ultra-religious voters are looking to more extreme parties for representation. Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, Jews overwhelmingly vote for religious conservatives, and their swelling population⁠—the group maintains a birth rate more than twice the national average⁠—has bolstered support for candidates like Mr Ben-Gvir.  Mr Ben-Gvir wants to be minister of public security in the new government. That will be a headache for Mr Netanyahu, who has returned as prime minister thanks to Mr Ben-Gvir’s voters. Mr Ben-Gvir wants greater scope for the police to shoot “terrorist” Arabs and supports weakening the Supreme Court’s ability to strike down laws. He also wants to remove the offences of fraud and breach of trust⁠—for which Mr Netanhayu is on trial⁠—from the criminal code. Such moves will strike fear into Arab communities and will alienate international allies, such as Joe Biden’s America. Mr Netanyahu avoids being photographed with Mr Ben-Gvir, but was willing to call on his voters to secure his own majority. Now he will have to figure out how to accommodate an extremist in his new government. ■"
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/10/israels-centrists-should-back-binyamin-netanyahu,"Israel, more than most other Western democracies, demands extraordinary sacrifice from its citizens. Its army, which conscripts most Jewish-Israeli men and women and whose values permeate society, requires soldiers to run towards danger. Its officers are taught to lead from the front, no matter the personal risk. Now some of that same spirit may be required of centrist members of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, in defence of the country’s liberal democracy. Yair Lapid, the outgoing prime minister, and Benny Gantz, his defence minister, fought five elections in four years to remove Binyamin Netanyahu and then keep him out of the prime minister’s office. Now, after 17 months in opposition, Mr Netanyahu is on his way back, having won a parliamentary majority by pandering to a vile assortment of Jewish supremacists, homophobes and far-right religious zealots gathered under the umbrella of the Religious Zionism bloc. If he embraces them in a coalition government, as he said he would while campaigning for the election on November 1st, he could undermine Israel’s democracy and grievously wound its judicial independence. To prevent this, centrists may have to do the unthinkable, and enter government with Mr Netanyahu in order to keep them out.  It is no small thing to ask centrists such as Mr Lapid, whose party came second, to link up with Mr Netanyahu, a street-fighting politician who has often left his coalition partners feeling bruised and degraded, and who trampled democratic norms during his 15 years in office. Many Israelis who voted for the parties of centre and left would see it as a betrayal of trust and principle if their leaders were, after all, to join a government led by Bibi, as Mr Netanyahu is widely known.  Israelis are proud of living in a country under the rule of law, albeit that Arabs in Israel proper and those in the Israeli-occupied territories tend not to share that feeling. Jewish Israelis believe that no fellow citizen is above the law. They note with satisfaction that a former prime minister and a former president were sent to prison—one for corruption, another for sex crimes. Past Israeli prime ministers have resigned promptly when accused of financial impropriety. Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial facing charges of bribery and fraud, has refused to do so.  More strikingly, Mr Netanyahu seems willing to shatter the taboo long upheld by Israel’s main parties, including his own Likud, that has prevented them from entering into governing coalitions with parties of the far right which patently deride the basic tenets of a liberal democracy. His electoral alliance with the Religious Zionism bloc breaks that mould, since it includes the Jewish Power party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, a rabid racist who has been known to admire Meir Kahane, a Jewish supremacist who exulted in violence against Arabs and was jailed for terrorism. Mr Ben-Gvir is ferociously hostile to Arabs and suggests that those who have Israeli citizenship—about a fifth of the total population—should be expelled from the country if they are deemed “disloyal”. Mr Ben-Gvir also wants to be the minister in charge of the police, who have investigated him several times for inciting violence. The bloc’s other co-leader, Bezalel Smotrich, is a homophobe who wants to segregate Arabs from Jews within Israel. He plans to curb the courts’ power to strike down legislation that contravenes Israel’s Basic Laws, which protect human rights—to ensure, for instance, that Jewish settlements on the West Bank can be made legal. He also wants to scrap from the statutes the crime of “breach of trust” that Mr Netanyahu has been charged with. A far-right coalition would also need the backing of the ultra-Orthodox parties, which want a weaker Supreme Court. Yet there is still a slender chance that Mr Netanyahu could be dissuaded from forming a government with such horrible allies. Under Israel’s system of extreme proportional representation, elections are invariably followed by horse-trading. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, a decent man of the old centre-left, will have to offer Mr Netanyahu, whose party won the most seats in the election, the first shot at forming a government. But he is also likely to urge him to ditch the extremists and instead make a coalition deal with the parties of the centre who have been in government for the past year and a half.  Messrs Lapid and Gantz have both ruled out going into a coalition government with Mr Netanyahu, whom they detest and want to see behind bars. Both would find it hard to break their word. They should take a deep, patriotic breath. To defend the principles they stand for—liberalism, democracy and the rule of law—they should do whatever it takes to keep out those who would junk them. For his part, if he has a shred of honour, Mr Netanyahu should turn his back on the worst of Israelis. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/01/01/israel-tightens-its-grip-on-the-golan-heights,"MEVO HAMA has magnificent views of three countries. On its western side is a sheer cliff dropping down to the Sea of Galilee and northern Israel. To the south is another steep drop, into Jordan. And across the mountain plateau to the east is Syria (see map). The kibbutz was established shortly after Israel seized most of the Golan Heights from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967. On December 26th the Israeli cabinet posed in front of the stunning views after a special meeting in Mevo Hama. The government, led by Naftali Bennett, the nationalist prime minister, had just approved a plan to spend 1bn shekels ($317m) on thousands of new homes and infrastructure in the Golan, with the aim of doubling its population (currently 52,000) by the end of the decade. The Golan is one of four territories grabbed by Israel during the six-day war. It handed the Sinai peninsula back to Egypt after agreeing to a peace deal in 1978. It withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 (though it occasionally returns in force). And the final status of the West Bank has not yet been determined. But Israel has long justified its position in the Golan by claiming self-defence. Syria had sometimes used the high ground to shell Israeli farms in the Galilee below. After Israel took over, it expelled some Syrians, established Jewish settlements and built army and intelligence posts. In 1981 it formally annexed 1,800 square kilometres of the strategically valuable territory. Nevertheless, there were negotiations to return it to Syria, as part of a broader peace deal, in the 1990s. They went nowhere. Most of the world believes that Israel’s annexation of the Golan is illegal. Yet only the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and Israeli environmental groups, concerned about the region’s flora and fauna, loudly objected to the new development plan. Few countries want to see the Golan returned to the murderous Mr Assad, even if they are uncomfortable with the precedent being set. Ministers from Labour and Meretz, left-wing parties that in the past supported a deal with Syria, voted in favour of the building plans. About half of the Golan’s population are Druze Arabs, who receive Israeli services and can request citizenship. Still, most have retained their Syrian identity, often as an insurance policy in case Israeli rule does end. Ordinary Israelis tend to view the Golan as a holiday destination. It is home to the country’s only ski resort. And whereas many Israelis fear going to the occupied West Bank, terror attacks in the Golan are rare. Attempts by Iran and its proxies to enlist the Druze in their fight against Israel have had little success. Mr Bennett said the development plan was prompted, in part, by America. In 2019 it became the first big country to recognise Israeli sovereignty in the Golan. Donald Trump, the president at the time, justified the decision using Israel’s logic of self-defence—though it also seemed timed to benefit Binyamin Netanyahu, then Israel’s prime minister, who was in a tough race for re-election. In gratitude, Israel named a settlement in the Golan after Mr Trump. Messrs Trump and Netanyahu have since been voted out of office, and most of the golden letters on the sign for “Trump Heights” have been torn off, probably by vandals. But the Biden administration shows no signs of reversing Mr Trump’s decision. Whether Mr Bennett plans to spend a few of those billion shekels on new lettering is less clear. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/22/trade-and-security-ties-are-knitting-israel-into-its-region,"“We’re passing over Saudi Arabia, then crossing over Jordan to arrive in Ben Gurion airport in about 40 minutes,” intones the pilot of a low-cost flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv. The plane is packed. A smattering of Emiratis keen to do business in Israel occupy the front seats. More raucous Israeli Jews and Palestinians returning from holiday weekends in the Gulf sit farther back. “Sababa le-gamrei!” (Hebrew for “bloody brilliant”), exclaims an Israeli student, describing her trip. In the two years since the United Arab Emirates (uae) and Israel signed the Abraham accords, more than half a million Israelis have made the journey. After a century of Jewish and Arab conflict, the trip already feels normal. Soon there will be 20 flights a day between the two countries. A Jewish community had taken seed in Dubai, the glitziest of the Emirates’ seven statelets, even before the accords were signed. But since then it has sprung into the open, growing from hundreds to thousands of Jewish residents, many of them Israeli. A Jewish school is doubling its intake every six months. There are kosher restaurants like Café Bibi, named after Binyamin Netanyahu, the former Israeli prime minister who signed the accords. For the first time since its creation in 1948, Israel has a warm peace with an Arab country, not just the formal, often frosty ones with Egypt and Jordan, its immediate neighbours. The uae is “the first to bring Israeli and Arab people together”, says Ebtesam al-Ketbi, who heads an Emirati think-tank. The accords are underpinning a realignment of trade, diplomacy and security arrangements in the Gulf. They are largely economic, built on the hope that trade can bring peace and restore the Middle East to its historic role as the crossroads of the world’s trade, linking Asia and Europe through the Silk Road and Africa through the Incense Road. But they also have a hard edge and are aimed at countering Iran, whose proxy forces have fired rockets or used drones to attack Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Israel, and whose nuclear programme could soon give it the ability to build a nuclear bomb.  “People-to-people can dissolve tensions,” says Peng Xiao, the ceo of g42, an Emirati company working on artificial intelligence and surveillance (with ties to the president’s brother and national security adviser, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed). His firm has opened two offices in Israel and already has 50 employees there. Within five years a third of his 5,000 workers may be Israeli. Rapyd, an Israeli payments company, sees itself as a trailblazer with a new office in Dubai. “For Israel it’s like going into space,” says Arik Shtilman, its boss.  On the Israeli right, politicians who once routinely lambasted Arab leaders are boasting of their connections in the Gulf. Ron Dermer, a prominent foreign-policy adviser to Mr Netanyahu, is a partner in Exigent Capital Group, a firm that is eagerly investing there. Ben Volkow, the ceo of Otonomo, a tech company in Tel Aviv, says he is scouting to hire more Arab Israelis now that a Saudi firm has bought almost a quarter of his stock. From the floor of Tel Aviv’s stock exchange the atmosphere is no less hopeful. “Not even the sky is the limit,” said Muhammad al-Khaja, the Emirati ambassador to Israel, before ringing the opening bell. Mr Khaja insists that within a decade the uae will be one of Israel’s five biggest trading partners. It has made a good start. Bilateral trade has exploded from $11.2m in 2019 to $1.2bn in 2021. At only about 0.2% of Israeli gdp, trade with the uae is far behind Israel’s biggest partners, the EU and Turkey. But it is already a lot more than Israel’s trade with Egypt and Jordan, even after decades of peace and diplomatic relations (see chart).  From the uae’s point of view, the Abraham accords with Israel are part of a broader trade strategy that is bypassing the six-country Gulf Co-operation Council, which has yet to fulfil its aims of creating a common market and shared currency. The Emirates have signed trade agreements with Indonesia and India, and are negotiating with Colombia and Kenya. The goal, says Thani al-Zeyoudi, the uae’s trade minister, is to move from being a gateway to the region to a “gateway to the world”.  It is a reasonable ambition. Arab countries trade little with the world besides energy. Excluding oil and gas, the 22-strong League of Arab States accounts for only 2.7% of the world’s flow, despite having 5.6% of its population. Trade within the group is particularly sluggish. Just 18% of it is conducted within the region, compared with 34% in East Asia and 69% in Europe. This stifles development and keeps many Arab countries dependent on fossil fuels.  One reason is that there is no effective rules-based common market along the lines of the eu. Although the pan-Arab Free Trade Area (pafta), signed in 1997, lowered tariffs on goods within the region, it still has some of the world’s highest trading costs. By contrast, many exports from the eu into the region face fewer non-tariff barriers, according to a un study. Many of the region’s economies are natural competitors, seeking greater market share for their energy exports, rather than producing different goods and services that can be traded between them. Israel, with its tech-focused, service-based economy and large defence manufacturers, offers new products and markets. “Israel is a tech supermarket,” says Amir Hayek, Israel’s ambassador to the uae. The movement of ideas offers the greatest promise, he reckons. Israel’s expertise in agricultural technology, especially irrigation and hydroponics, could prove particularly helpful.  Cyber-security and defence is another sphere of co-operation, especially as Gulf governments think America may be withdrawing from the region. Israel has been pushing a plan to link radar stations and missile defences to shield the uae from Iran and give Israel early warning of any Iranian missiles launched in its direction. Exports of Israeli arms to the Abrahamic quartet rose to $800m in 2021, 7% of the country’s total military sales. Under President Donald Trump, the Pentagon shifted overall responsibility for Israel from eucom, its European command, to centcom, the one that covers the Middle East and Iran. Since that change Israel has been taking part in joint military exercises with its new friends, as well as with countries that don’t recognise it, such as Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. It now has military people stationed in Bahrain. “We’re the region’s new America,” says a senior official. Naftali Bennett, Israel’s prime minister until June, championed a plan to build a regional defence system that would use lasers to blast missiles.  Since the uae signed the accord in September 2020, three other Arab countries—Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan—have formally followed suit. Relations with Egypt are starting to thaw. Other Gulf states have eased entry procedures for Israelis, while stopping short of official recognition. But the big Abrahamic question is whether Saudi Arabia, the Arabian peninsula’s biggest economy and a potential land bridge between Israel’s Mediterranean coast and the uae, could join the club. “We’re becoming this incredible conduit for Israel,” says the ceo of G42, flagging up other Arab countries that could follow suit. His company’s investment of $300m in Israel will open markets for Israeli telecoms in Saudi Arabia, among others. Bahrain, already a member of the club, serves as a banking hub for financial transactions between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Even Iranians in Dubai, Iran’s favourite escape-hatch from Western sanctions, say they are eyeing deals with Israeli tech firms. Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, is said to have allocated $2bn to invest in Israeli startups. This year one of the kingdom’s wealthiest families, the al-Rajhi, bought stakes in two Israeli companies. The kingdom already has a self-proclaimed ultra-Orthodox chief rabbi who commutes from Jerusalem, as well as a new kosher restaurant. “Veterans from Unit 8200 are trying to replicate Silicon Valley in Riyadh,” says a well-connected Saudi watcher, referring to the Israeli army’s cyber-arm, whose former members often end up founding or working in tech startups, and are said to be setting up shop in the Saudi capital. Few expect formal relations to improve so long as King Salman bin Abdulaziz lives. Although ailing, he has long supported the Palestinian cause. Even so, “most things are possible short of recognition,” says another Saudi official, “including tourism.” Yet these new friendships remain fragile. After the peace accord was signed between Israel and the Palestinians in Oslo in 1993, Israel took part in regional economic conferences heralding “a new Middle East”. Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Tunisia opened liaison offices. But when bloody conflict erupted between Israel and the Palestinians a few years later, all such talk of harmony evaporated.  Bigwigs on both sides now hope to insulate the accords from Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians. “Let’s not mix this [the Abraham accords] with that [the Palestinians],” says an Emirati official. Few say it openly, but the accords mark a tacit acceptance by many Arab rulers that Israel, for the time being, has won. Some even suggest they offer a way of ending this enmity. Mr Bennett, in whose office lobby lies a coffee-table book titled “Dubai Wonder”, calls his pact with Raam, the first Arab party to join an Israeli government, an “internalised” version of the Abraham accords. Yet many expect the accords will be severely tested if there is flare-up in Jerusalem or a resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, or Hizbullah, a militia-cum-political-party in Lebanon. Both groups are building rocket arsenals aimed at Israel. The strain would be particularly intense if the fighting leads to large numbers of Palestinian or Lebanese civilian casualties, something Israel’s military planners argue they would struggle to minimise since both Hamas and Hizbullah hide their rockets in homes and schools. Moreover, politicians, diplomats and businessfolk on both sides of the accords have moved faster than the general population has. A survey by the Washington Institute, an American think-tank, shows public support for the Abraham accords in the uae and Saudi Arabia has fallen sharply since they were signed. The Arab Barometer, a pollster, found that only 5% of people in Jordan and Egypt were keen on having much friendlier relations with Israel (though responses in Morocco and Sudan were more enthusiastic). Such views are mirrored in Israel, where many still distrust Arab countries. “Israelis are happy with normalisation as long as it stops at the Jordan river,” says Liel Maghen, an Israeli analyst. Many Israelis, brought up for generations in the belief that Israel is a beacon of democracy in a desert of backward-looking tyranny, are nervous about venturing out. Israeli left-wingers, too, shy from what they see as a right-wing and anti-Palestinian deal. “I’ll never go to Dubai,” says Noam Shuster-Eliassi, an Israeli comedian, mocking her fellow citizens for stopping Palestinians at checkpoints but then flying to the uae.  And the economic benefits of the accords to both sides may still be too nascent to make the new peace-and-business process irreversible. This is partly because red tape, possibly born of mistrust, keeps getting in the way of deals. Dubai’s al-Tadawi Hospital is still waiting for approvals to hire Israeli doctors. Rapyd, the Israeli financial-software provider, has yet to receive its Emirati operating licence. Sudan, which signed the accords in January 2021, has since stalled on implementing them.  On the Israeli side, bureaucracy stands in the way of Emirati plans for mega-projects. dp World, a giant port operator based in Dubai, withdrew its bid to develop Israel’s Mediterranean port at Haifa after Israel changed the ownership rules. Israeli officials have blocked Emirati plans to reactivate an energy pipeline stretching from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. Even an Emirati-funded project to provide Israel with solar power produced in Jordan, in exchange for Israel sending water to its parched neighbour, has been stalled. Israel has been slow to approve the building of a desalination plant on its shores.  Meanwhile, the Abrahamic idea of a railway from the Gulf to Haifa, Israel’s port on the Mediterranean, is still blocked by Jordan (see map). Israel and Saudi Arabia have built their lines right up to the Jordanian border. But mindful of its own Palestinian majority, Jordan won’t link them up until Israel also extends its network to the Palestinian West Bank. If these tracks were all connected, the volume of container traffic would double “almost immediately”, says Yisrael Gal, an Israeli economist. Also galling for pioneers of the Abrahamic club is the prospect that Iran, its great rival, may yet steal a march on it by reopening the old east-west Silk Road. For the first time since Cyrus the Great ruled Persia 2,500 years ago, Iran now has a land-bridge stretching from Central Asia through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon to the ports of the Mediterranean. Members of the accord need not fret. Their club links together dynamic, growing economies. Iran’s road connects failing states and seems mainly used to carry weapons.  The Abraham accords promise much, yet are in their infancy in a region that dashes even the worthiest of dreams. But they also offer a rare chance for economic renewal and for the Jewish state to be accepted by its neighbours as something other than an enemy—perhaps even, as the Koran calls Abraham, a friend. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/18/in-israel-birth-rates-are-converging-between-jews-and-muslims,"“If an israeli woman has fewer than three children, she feels as if she owes everyone an explanation—or an apology.” That, at any rate, is the view of a leading Israeli demographer. When she visits London she is struck by its dearth of toy shops. Israelis have many more children than their counterparts elsewhere in the rich world. Whereas the average Israeli woman has 2.9, her British and French peers have 1.6 and 1.8 respectively.  Demography in the Holy Land has geopolitical as well as economic consequences. Of Israel’s population of 9.5m, Israeli Arabs, mostly Muslim, make up about 21% of the total, while Jews account for roughly 74%. But include people in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza, and the Jewish majority falls to barely half.  This, in a nutshell, is the basis of Israel’s trilemma. It cannot have at the same time a strong Jewish majority, all the land it conquered in 1967 and full democracy that does not discriminate against Arabs. So numbers matter. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have long scrutinised birth rates. Yasser Arafat, who led the Palestinians for three-and-a-half decades, described “the womb of the Arab woman” as his “strongest weapon”. Demographic projections used to suggest that Arabs living between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean would eventually outnumber Jews. This certainly worried Binyamin Netanyahu before he became Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. In 2003 he lamented that the birth rate of Israeli Arabs, then much higher, was imperilling Israel’s Jewishness, irrespective of the trend in the West Bank and Gaza.  At the time there was indeed a wide demographic gap. In Israel itself Arab women were having almost twice as many babies on average as Jewish women. But in the past few decades this gap has disappeared, as the birth rate of Israeli Arabs has fallen while that of Israeli Jews has risen. In 1960 the fertility rate of Israeli Arabs stood at 9.3. In the next 35 years it dropped by almost half, to 4.7, before sliding to 3.0 today (see chart). The birth rate of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank also declined, from 4.6 in 2003 to 3.8 in 2019. In this Palestinians and Israeli Arabs have followed a path trodden by women elsewhere. Across the oecd, a club mostly of rich countries, the average fertility rate has fallen from almost three in 1970 to 1.6, well below the rate of about 2.1 needed to keep a population from shrinking.  Globally Muslims have the highest fertility rate of any religious group, according to the Pew Research Centre. Yet even this rate has fallen sharply, from 4.3 in 1995 to 2.9 in 2015. Seven Arab countries were among the 12 recording the world’s biggest drops in fertility between the late 1970s and mid-2000s. In Iran, whose religious leaders have long called on women to have more babies, the birth rate has fallen from 7.0 in 1984 to 1.7.  This makes the rising birth rate of Jewish Israelis all the more surprising. Between 1960 and 1990 their fertility declined from 3.4 to 2.6, suggesting they were in step with their sisters elsewhere. But then they began to buck the trend, driving the birth rate back up to its current level of 3.1.  Almost all this increase is caused by Israel’s growing number of ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) Jews, who have a fertility rate of 6.6, more than double the national average and three times the rate of secular Jews. As a result the share of Haredim in Israel’s population has more or less doubled every generation, notes Dan Ben-David, an economist at Tel Aviv University and the Shoresh Institute, a think-tank. Though Haredim are just 13% of the population, their offspring make up 19% of Israeli children under the age of 14, and 24% of those under the age of four. Israel’s statistical agency reckons that under present trends half of Israeli children will be Haredi by 2065.  Such fruitfulness may please rabbis and Jewish nationalists. But it is also changing the character of Israel and threatening its economy, argues Mr Ben-David. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews send their boys to study Torah in religious schools rather than make them learn subjects, such as maths and science, needed for a job in Israel’s high-tech economy. Less than half of Haredi men enter the workforce: most keep studying ancient texts in adulthood. They are often financially supported by their wives and subsidised by the state.  There are several reasons why the birth rate among Haredim has remained so high. Many want big families to make up for the millions of Jews killed in the Holocaust, or believe they are serving God by multiplying. “I didn’t do any [family] planning,” says Yerach Toker, who has six children. “A lot of things are in God’s hands, and this is one of them.” Haredi women also tend to marry and have children at a younger age than secular Jews. And because ultra-Orthodox communities have tried hard to close themselves off from outside influences such as television and the internet, they may be somewhat insulated from the forces pushing down fertility in the rest of the world.  But it is harder to explain why secular Jewish Israelis also have more children than the norm. Most work; paid leave for Israeli parents is not especially generous. Nor is child care cheaper than in other rich places. Some argue that Jewish Israelis make more babies because they foresee a rosier future: Israel ranks among the world’s top ten countries in happiness. Another reason may be that the state encourages baby-making by, for instance, bankrolling fertility treatment. It subsidises in-vitro fertilisation to the tune of $150m a year. Tiny Israel has about the same number of frozen embryos as America. This may have only a slight effect on Israel’s birth rate, but it signals that the government wants its citizens to procreate.  One more explanation may be that Israeli grandparents tend to help out more than their peers in many other rich countries. Since Israel is small and densely populated, grandma is never far away. In one survey 83% of secular Jewish mothers aged 25-39 said they were supported by their child’s grandparents, whereas only 30% of German mothers said the same. In Israel the traditional family structure is still strong. In France and Britain more than half of babies are born out of wedlock. In Israel it is under 10%.  The convergence of birth rates between Israeli Jews and Arabs suggests demography will be far less important than either Israeli doom-mongers feared or Palestinian nationalists once hoped. Since neither community is likely to swamp the other with babies, both will still have to work out how to live together peacefully in their disputed slice of the Middle East. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/02/12/did-the-police-in-israel-use-pegasus-spyware-on-citizens,"UNTIL RECENTLY many Israelis took pride in Pegasus, a fearsome bit of spyware developed by NSO Group, a local firm. The technology exploits weaknesses in a smartphone’s digital defences, allowing users to eavesdrop on conversations, access data and control the camera and microphone. While marketed as a means for governments to fight organised crime and terrorism, Pegasus has reportedly been used by authoritarians to target activists, journalists and politicians. But Israelis brushed aside those concerns. The tool’s popularity was proof that their country’s tech firms are world class. The mood is changing, though. Pegasus is not only a threat to foreigners, reports Calcalist, a local newspaper. The Israeli police have also used the software, without a court order, to spy on local activists, politicians and businessmen, the paper claims. Its allegations have not been corroborated. But they were enough to convince the government to investigate. Naftali Bennett, the prime minister, said the deputy attorney-general was looking into the matter. The public-security minister, Omer Barlev, who oversees the police, called for a commission of inquiry. The list of people allegedly targeted by the police has ignited a firestorm of indignation among supporters of Binyamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister (pictured). It includes his aides and one of his sons. It also includes a crucial state witness in the corruption trial of Mr Netanyahu, who pounced on the allegations. He called it a “dark day for Israeli democracy” and said the alleged use of Pegasus by the police was like the army “using planes meant to be used against Iran, Hizbullah and Hamas to blow up Israeli civilians”. Much is still unclear—like who might have chosen the targets of Pegasus and why. Nevertheless, Mr Netanyahu’s allies have called for his trial to be dismissed. For now, it has been suspended so that the prosecution can figure out whether Pegasus was used in the gathering of evidence. A commission of inquiry may, eventually, provide some answers. But it also carries risks for Mr Netanyahu, who leads the opposition in the Knesset (Israel’s parliament). His critics were quick to note that the alleged abuses by the police are said to have occurred on his watch. As prime minister, Mr Netanyahu served as NSO Group’s chief salesman, offering Pegasus to foreign leaders as a carrot for better relations. The firm’s customer list includes the populist leaders of Brazil, Hungary and India, with whom Mr Netanyahu got along, as well as the Sunni Arab regimes—Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates—that established relations with Israel during his tenure. Mr Netanyahu had also urged the Israeli police to do more with the tools at its disposal. In 2015 he chose Roni Alsheikh to lead the force. Mr Alsheikh was an unusual pick, having never served in the police. But he had been the deputy chief of Shin Bet, the internal security agency, which uses cyber-technology in its counter-terrorism operations. At his induction ceremony, Mr Netanyahu urged him to use it “also for policing, also for the daily protection of civilians and for law enforcement”. Still, there is no public evidence that Mr Netanyahu was aware that the police were using Pegasus. Mr Alsheikh says the reports are “disconnected from reality”. It will be interesting to see how Mr Bennett’s government navigates the scandal, given its ties to the cyber-industry. His interior minister, Ayelet Shaked, is a former tech executive with friends at NSO Group. The prime minister himself made millions co-founding an online-banking security company. As defence minister (under Mr Netanyahu) he proposed giving NSO Group data about Israelis as part of an effort to contain covid-19. That led to a backlash from other lawmakers. The government may be growing weary of all the controversy surrounding NSO Group. Late last year America blacklisted the company. Weeks later Apple sued it for “weaponising powerful state-sponsored spyware” against its customers. Now Israelis are complaining, too. Perhaps it is time to rein in Pegasus. ■"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics,"Forming a government in Israel is always a messy affair. Thanks to the country’s extreme proportional-representation system for elections, no party has ever won an outright majority in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Intense haggling between the prospective prime minister and the parties wishing to join a coalition always follows an election. In the words of Yitzhak Rabin, an Israeli prime minister assassinated by a Jewish supremacist 27 years ago this week: “In every coalition there’s also some co-loathing.” His adage rings true today. Some of the parties hoping to form a coalition government with Binyamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, which won easily the most seats in an election on November 1st, are widely loathed. The most prominent is Itamar Ben-Gvir (portrayed above left), the leader of the Jewish Power party within a far-right bloc called Religious Zionism. He once declared, when Mr Rabin was prime minister, that he would “get to him”. A co-leader of the bloc, Bezalel Smotrich, used the annual memorial for Rabin’s murder to air an old conspiracy theory that Israel’s security service had “encouraged” the assassination. A third would-be coalition partner heads a party that is fiercely homophobic. Religious Zionism is now the third-largest group in the Knesset. Mr Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, who is anxious to return to power after 17 months in opposition, needs it to secure a majority.  Liberal Israelis are horrified by the prospect of Mr Ben-Gvir in government. He once led the youth wing of a virulently anti-Arab movement known as Kach, founded by an American-Israeli rabbi, Meir Kahane. From 1988 it was barred from running in Israeli elections. In 1994 it was banned by the government as a terrorist organisation. Mr Ben-Gvir has rebranded Kach as Jewish Power, toning down its rhetoric a tad. Instead of chanting “Death to the Arabs”, his disciples are now instructed to chant “Death to the terrorists”. “Ben-Gvir is still inspired by Kahane and thinks like him,” says Tomer Persico, an expert on Jewish radicalism at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem. “The question is whether he can put that ideology into practice.” At the top of Mr Ben-Gvir’s list of conditions for joining the government is that he be appointed public-security minister in control of Israel’s police. Should Mr Netanyahu grant him that post, already tense relations with Israel’s Arab minority, which numbers about a fifth of the population, could further deteriorate. A frequent flashpoint is Jerusalem’s Temple Mount, where some Jewish radicals, including Mr Ben-Gvir, want to scrap the rules that prohibit Jews from praying beside the al-Aqsa mosque. Clashes there between Palestinians and the Israeli police have led in the past to violence that has spread across Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Religious Zionism also hopes to pass an “overriding” clause that would let the Knesset countermand court rulings. That would weaken the Supreme Court’s power to block government actions and laws that curtail human rights. This change is also backed by ultra-Orthodox parties bidding to join a governing coalition under Mr Netanyahu. They have their own additional demands, including more funds for religious schools that do not teach “secular” subjects like mathematics. Despite his nationalist language and sniping at the courts, Mr Netanyahu in previous stints in office has refrained from rehashing the legal system. Nor has he tried to change the status quo on the Temple Mount. His previous coalitions have included parties to the left of Likud to give himself wriggle room to avoid meeting the demands of parties to his right. This time round he may be more beholden to the far right. So far no parties to his left will agree to join a coalition led by him. The two leaders of parties of the centre, the outgoing prime minister, Yair Lapid, and the defence minister, Benny Gantz, have flatly ruled out serving under a prime minister facing corruption charges, which Mr Netanyahu has battled for two years. He may by instinct lean towards a more pragmatic type of coalition, as in the past, but the far-right and religious parties are the only ones which, for the moment, will guarantee him his majority.  Moreover, they might well help pass legislation that would end his trial for bribery and fraud. “Netanyahu always ran populist campaigns, but once elected usually governed as a pragmatist,” says Gayil Talshir of Jerusalem’s Hebrew University. “But now, because of his trial and the coalition he’s about to form, we may indeed be about to see populism in power.” It is not just his desire to evade justice that makes it trickier for Israeli centrists to deal with Mr Netanyahu. His party has shifted further to the right, too. Likud was always staunchly nationalist but in the past it has respected Israel’s courts and shunned Rabbi Kahane’s racism. Nowadays, however, most of Likud’s representatives support an alliance with Jewish Power and sound happy to curb the courts. Voices on the centre and left are urging Messrs Lapid and Gantz to join a government with Mr Netanyahu as the lesser of evils, to keep out the far right. So far they are refusing to do so. Meanwhile, liberal democracy in Israel is under threat. ■"
